We hope that this series engenders questions,<br>suggestions and interactions that will infuse SID's continued<br>transformation.<br>(S//SI) The core of our customer relationships is understanding<br>and meeting our customers' Information Needs. Those needs, as<br>you all know, are myriad. Working in the SID is a challenge since<br>meeting customer needs means defending the nation, supporting<br>the campaign against terrorism, and providing vital support to<br>warfighters under fire in Iraq and to the National Policy Makers who<br>must now engage in Iraq's reconstruction. Meeting customer needs<br>also means both maintaining coverage on other national SIGINT<br>priorities, such as the continuing crisis in North Korea, and<br>enduring strategic issues, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br>That challenge is being met successfully today through hard work,<br>innovation, partnership, and Information Needs (IN) management,<br>all of which combine to produce cohesive, positive outcomes. That<br>coordinated effort will be demonstrated in our five-part series.<br>(S//SI) The war in Iraq has presented a prism through which we<br>have been able to view the effectiveness of our planning,<br>programs, and relationships.

We hope that this series engenders questions,suggestions and interactions that will infuse SID's continuedtransformation.(S//SI) The core of our customer relationships is understandingand meeting our customers' Information Needs. Those needs, asyou all know, are myriad. Working in the SID is a challenge sincemeeting customer needs means defending the nation, supportingthe campaign against terrorism, and providing vital support towarfighters under fire in Iraq and to the National Policy Makers whomust now engage in Iraq's reconstruction. Meeting customer needsalso means both maintaining coverage on other national SIGINTpriorities, such as the continuing crisis in North Korea, andenduring strategic issues, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction.That challenge is being met successfully today through hard work,innovation, partnership, and Information Needs (IN) management,all of which combine to produce cohesive, positive outcomes. Thatcoordinated effort will be demonstrated in our five-part series.(S//SI) The war in Iraq has presented a prism through which wehave been able to view the effectiveness of our planning,programs, and relationships. Central to our strategy are our effortsto make customers more active participants in the SIGINT systemby giving them the ability to see into and influence USCS activities.The next article in this series (i.e. the second) on the NationalSIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) will describe the orderly flowof Information Needs during the war.

S2 will<br>be the first organization to provide data to the ARC, but eventually all analysts throughout the<br>NSA extended enterprise will be included in the database .<br>(U//FOUO) The datacalls will be conducted by the DANCEHALL Team using a tool called the<br>Cryptologic Volunteer Application (CVA).

Individuals<br>who would like to be considered for a move should follow the procedures described in the<br>Cryptologic Vacancy Application process to volunteer for a specific position.

Since that time, he has effectivelytripled the scope of the mission, helping to increase the level of tactical support to U.S. andcoalition forces in the Persian Gulf region. His target development work has helped lead to theexploitation of new sources of collection that account for over 60% of the GRSOC's Iran TargetDivision's production.  recognized the need for a target development team in thedivision, and trained a 5-member team that has had success against the GRSOC military targetset. He has received several awards, including the Keystone Award and Szymanowski Award, forhis contributions.(U) These are only some of the achievements of the Rochefort Award winners.

For over 30 years, the collection and<br>processing of international communications from foreign communications satellites (FORNSAT)<br>has been part of NSA's balanced collection program. To maintain that balance, FORNSAT<br>Program has planned a vigorous modernization. The FORNSAT Plan probes the current<br>intelligence value of the FORNSAT program vis-a-vis the commercial satellite business plans for<br>launches, services and customers. Then it lays out the current technical capability, pointing out<br>the current and future needs and prioritizing the system gaps. These gaps form the basis for the<br>proposed modernization. It's no surprise that the FORNSAT system is in a dire need of upgrade<br>to exploit the technology already introduced to the commercial industry--technology that is<br>being used today by important intelligence targets, i.e. mobile satellite phones, digital video<br>broadcast over satellite, private satellite networks, etc.<br>(TS//SI) Major thrusts of this plan begin with the need for a wholesale change in the FORNSAT<br>architecture. The last major upgrade for the program was Trans World Digital (TWD) in the mid90s. TWD targeted long-haul international circuit-switched telephony and was designed before<br>the Internet boom. Bottom-line is that the current architecture, primarily engineered for voice<br>traffic, is trying to support high data-rate DNI carriers. The second major thrust is in the area of<br>Mobile Satellite Services (Thuraya, ACeS, Inmarsat and others). These service providers<br>illuminate their coverage areas through the use of hundreds of spot beams. Our 13 fixed<br>FORNSAT sites cannot provide the necessary access; the plan presents a number of options,<br>including relying on our covert partners to provide the required points of presence. Lastly, the<br>Plan proposes ways to improve FORNSAT's SIGINT Development capabilities. Initiatives range<br>from providing additional resources, to the concept of the \"Virtual Analyst\"--leveraging the<br>various Signals Development Centers to provide signals analysis support to our covert partners.<br>(TS//SI) For over 30 years, FORNSAT has provided timely and significant information on a wide<br>variety of intelligence topics that by their nature flow across national boundaries. This access has<br>delivered transit traffic about terrorists, international crime, weapons of mass destruction,<br>proliferation, arms control, international finance and trade, not to mention the intelligence<br>derived from diplomatic communications, private commercial networks, airline reservations and<br>billing data. The flexible architecture of the FORNSAT system has allowed NSA to fine-tune<br>collection and processing and locate information relevant to the most current intelligence needs.<br>For this reason, FORNSAT has consistently provided the information used in over 25% of end<br>product reporting year after year.

Obviously your name and your<br>SSN are part of HR CONCERTO for identification purposes. There is also a SECURITY part of<br>CONCERTO. This is where your clearances, etc. are kept. Your name and SSN are also part of<br>SECURITY CONCERTO for identification purposes. The two parts of CONCERTO are kept separate<br>for obvious security reasons, but \"Mary Jane Smith\" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in HR CONCERTO<br>is the same person as \"Smith,Mary Jane\" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in SECURITY CONCERTO.<br>(U//FOUO) SEARCHLIGHT is the Agency's corporate directory service. The \"registration\" of your<br>name and SSN in SEARCHLIGHT (for those of you whose SEARCHLIGHT records are marked<br>\"confirmed\") originated in the HR CONCERTO. In HR CONCERTO, middle initials tend to be more<br>prevalent than middle names. So \"Mary Jane Smith\" may have appeared in SEARCHLIGHT as<br>\"Mary J. Smith\".<br>(U//FOUO) ...ENTER THE PKI CERTIFICATE:<br>(U//FOUO) A required part of creating the PKI certificate, which is used to electronically identify<br>you, is the inclusion of your full name. Because your PKI will be used for identification in<br>electronic systems and exchanges (such as e-mail), the corporate directory system,<br>SEARCHLIGHT, must now have you registered with your full name. Part of your PKI certificate<br>also includes your security credentials and the official source of this information is SECURITY<br>CONCERTO. To get your PKI certificate, your full name must be in SEARCHLIGHT and must<br>match your full name in SECURITY CONCERTO. So, in order to get a PKI certificate, \"Mary J.<br>Smith\" in SEARCHLIGHT must be changed to \"Mary Jane Smith.\" In addition, for those people<br>who did not already have a PKI certificate by March 2003, it is important to know that the name<br>change has already occurred in SEARCHLIGHT. For those who already had a PKI certificate at<br>that time, the name change has been delayed until it is time to renew the PKI certificate. When<br>those people renew their PKI certificate, a process will be triggered to automatically change their<br>SEARCHLIGHT name to match their SECURITY CONCERTO name. If there are any differences<br>between the way names are stored in SEARCHLIGHT and HR CONCERTO, those differences will<br>have to be resolved by contacting Security Information, Q235 with an email to \"ISMT\" (as noted<br>above).<br>(U//FOUO) NAME DIFFERENCES IN PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CERTIFICATES:<br>(U//FOUO) Many of you who have previously received your PKI certificates, did so with your<br>name in SEARCHLIGHT at a time, and in a format, which preceded the \"rollover\" of names from<br>SECURITY CONCERTO.

The position I<br>accepted was working in the Mission Operations Group (MOG) as a<br>Mission Planner. On a daily basis I influence the scheduling, live<br>execution, tasking and collection for a specific geographic area. It<br>has required that I expand my professional horizons, and has given<br>me the chance to regularly team with the operators and collection<br>managers who conduct the live mission as well as interact with the<br>SID organizations, the RSOCs and Intelligence Community<br>customers.<br>(U) While I have been very satisfied with the job here in Denver, I<br>have been at least as pleased with the living conditions in the area.<br>Denver's wonderful climate is a big contributor. Denver gets over<br>300 days of sunshine a year, which is more than any other U.S.<br>city except one. Thanks to the many days of sunshine and<br>extremely low humidity, those living in Colorado love taking<br>advantage of outdoor sporting activities. There are hundreds and<br>hundreds of miles of bicycle trails and walking paths all over the<br>metropolitan area. My family was pleasantly surprised to find a<br>path only about 100 yards from our house, which actually connects<br>with trails and paths that can take one to Denver International<br>Airport, approximately 35 miles away. Some of these trails can<br>also take one into the city as well as further into the suburbs. The<br>best part is that these trails are accessible nearly year round.<br>Having access to many state parks as well as national parks for<br>hiking and mountain climbing is another benefit to being in this<br>area.<br>(U) It would be an injustice to talk about a tour in Denver without<br>mentioning the mountains and opportunities to enjoy the winter<br>activities. One can drive to many of the ski resorts within one or<br>two hours or take the weekend ski train from downtown Denver.<br>The resorts provide many opportunities to ski, snowboard,<br>snowshoe, tube, ice skate and more. In fact for parents with<br>children in elementary school, field trips to take skiing or<br>snowboarding lessons are regularly offered when classes are not in<br>session. (Year-round schools are very popular here.) Finally I<br>should point out that Denver really does not get the snowfall that<br>many believe. Even though it frequently snows, it usually melts<br>within a day. The biggest snows come to the mountains, and<br>Denver is on the western edge of the Great Plains. The mammoth<br>snowfall (3-4 ft) we saw in 2003 was highly unusual and was<br>apparently the biggest since about 1913.<br>(U) The year round schools in the Denver area that I mentioned<br>earlier are actually only for elementary school students.

    "plain_text": "DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL(U) SID Around the World: Peak Conditions in DenverFROM:Field Station DenverRun Date: 09/02/2003(U//FOUO) After spending nearly two decades at NSAW, I can trulysay that having an assignment at Field Station Denver has beenone of the most rewarding experiences of my career. The position Iaccepted was working in the Mission Operations Group (MOG) as aMission Planner. On a daily basis I influence the scheduling, liveexecution, tasking and collection for a specific geographic area. Ithas required that I expand my professional horizons, and has givenme the chance to regularly team with the operators and collectionmanagers who conduct the live mission as well as interact with theSID organizations, the RSOCs and Intelligence Communitycustomers.(U) While I have been very satisfied with the job here in Denver, Ihave been at least as pleased with the living conditions in the area.Denver's wonderful climate is a big contributor. Denver gets over300 days of sunshine a year, which is more than any other U.S.city except one. Thanks to the many days of sunshine andextremely low humidity, those living in Colorado love takingadvantage of outdoor sporting activities. There are hundreds andhundreds of miles of bicycle trails and walking paths all over themetropolitan area. My family was pleasantly surprised to find apath only about 100 yards from our house, which actually connectswith trails and paths that can take one to Denver InternationalAirport, approximately 35 miles away. Some of these trails canalso take one into the city as well as further into the suburbs. Thebest part is that these trails are accessible nearly year round.Having access to many state parks as well as national parks forhiking and mountain climbing is another benefit to being in thisarea.(U) It would be an injustice to talk about a tour in Denver withoutmentioning the mountains and opportunities to enjoy the winteractivities. One can drive to many of the ski resorts within one ortwo hours or take the weekend ski train from downtown Denver.The resorts provide many opportunities to ski, snowboard,snowshoe, tube, ice skate and more. In fact for parents withchildren in elementary school, field trips to take skiing orsnowboarding lessons are regularly offered when classes are not insession. (Year-round schools are very popular here.) Finally Ishould point out that Denver really does not get the snowfall thatmany believe. Even though it frequently snows, it usually meltswithin a day. The biggest snows come to the mountains, andDenver is on the western edge of the Great Plains. The mammothsnowfall (3-4 ft) we saw in 2003 was highly unusual and wasapparently the biggest since about 1913.(U) The year round schools in the Denver area that I mentionedearlier are actually only for elementary school students. There areat least two excellent possibilities in the area, the Cherry CreekPublic Schools and Douglas County Public Schools. In addition totraditional schools, both districts also offer options in charter SERIES: (U) SID Around theWorld '031.  Coming Soon: SIDAround the World!2.

I arrived at NSA/CSS Europe<br>(NCEUR), Cryptologic Applications Directorate (F26), in Stuttgart,<br>Germany, just over a year ago as the Chief of Staff. Although I<br>started my career as a SIGINTer, I had been managing training and<br>HR organizations for several years. Coming to NCEUR has allowed<br>me to re-enter, at least in part, the SIGINT world. The Cryptologic<br>Applications (CApps) Directorate is co-located with, and provides<br>support to, the U.S. European Command HQ, on Patch Barracks.<br>(U//FOUO) This is my fifth overseas assignment, having served<br>one tour in Korea on active duty, two tours as a military spouse in<br>Greece and Japan, and two as an NSA civilian in England and<br>Germany. As a result, I can say authoritatively that the best part of<br>life in the field is travel. Stuttgart is in a great location since we<br>can travel to most of Germany, as well as France, Switzerland, or<br>Austria in a matter of a few hours. The rest of Europe is easily and<br>inexpensively accessed as well. As a single parent with a daughter<br>in college, my daughter also benefits from my tour abroad since<br>she is able to spend her Christmas and summer breaks in Europe.<br>In one year she has already traveled with me to England, France,<br>Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands. We still have two years to<br>go!<br>(U) Each country I have lived in has had a slightly, or sometimes<br>radically, different lifestyle. However, the common thread has been<br>that I have learned to respect other ways of life, and learned that<br>\"our\" way is not the only way. A Field experience is a tremendous<br>benefit for kids and is something that will impact them their entire<br>life. They learn to appreciate differences and become more flexible- both excellent life skills!<br>(U//FOUO) I was asked what I will miss most when I leave<br>Stuttgart. I think I will miss the friends that I have made here, and<br>will continue to make throughout my tour. When you work in the<br>field, you not only work with your colleagues, but tend to socialize<br>with them as well. Although some might not agree, I believe life in<br>the Field creates a stronger bond than a traditional work<br>relationship. Although that is not everyone's \"cup of tea\", I have<br>found my most rewarding friendships have been those from my<br>field tours. I have had a wonderful 18-year career at the Agency,<br>but can say without hesitation that my Field experiences have been<br>the greatest benefit of my career.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.

Stuttgart is in a great location since wecan travel to most of Germany, as well as France, Switzerland, orAustria in a matter of a few hours. The rest of Europe is easily andinexpensively accessed as well. As a single parent with a daughterin college, my daughter also benefits from my tour abroad sinceshe is able to spend her Christmas and summer breaks in Europe.In one year she has already traveled with me to England, France,Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands. We still have two years togo!(U) Each country I have lived in has had a slightly, or sometimesradically, different lifestyle. However, the common thread has beenthat I have learned to respect other ways of life, and learned that\"our\" way is not the only way. A Field experience is a tremendousbenefit for kids and is something that will impact them their entirelife. They learn to appreciate differences and become more flexible- both excellent life skills!(U//FOUO) I was asked what I will miss most when I leaveStuttgart. I think I will miss the friends that I have made here, andwill continue to make throughout my tour. When you work in thefield, you not only work with your colleagues, but tend to socializewith them as well. Although some might not agree, I believe life inthe Field creates a stronger bond than a traditional workrelationship. Although that is not everyone's \"cup of tea\", I havefound my most rewarding friendships have been those from myfield tours. I have had a wonderful 18-year career at the Agency,but can say without hesitation that my Field experiences have beenthe greatest benefit of my career. SERIES: (U) SID Around theWorld '031.

This paper changes the relationship between<br>NSA's headquarters and field elements, and has a direct impact on how SID operates. Although<br>we recommend you read the entire paper (it's nine pages, but an easy read) for the full story,<br>we've excerpted below some of these key points that relate to SID:<br>(U) MISSION <br>(U//FOUO) The paper restates that \"All SIGINT and related activities are under the direct<br>operational control of the Director of SID or his designated representative... In short,<br>headquarters elements will exercise operational control of their activity wherever it is found<br>across the enterprise. This control includes guidance, tasking, prioritization, and resource<br>allocation as well as the setting of policy, mission standards and performance metrics.\"<br>(U) COMMAND<br>(U//FOUO) \"None of the above removes the responsibility of a field chief or a site commander<br>to act as a chief or commander. Headquarters elements exercise operational control of mission<br>in the extended enterprise through the chiefs and commanders . We will have centralized<br>direction, but we must also have decentralized execution.\"<br>(U) GOVERNANCE: WRIT LARGE<br>(U//FOUO) \"...each headquarters mission area will be responsible - working through the chiefs<br>and commanders - for control of its respective activity on site.

Althoughwe recommend you read the entire paper (it's nine pages, but an easy read) for the full story,we've excerpted below some of these key points that relate to SID:(U) MISSION (U//FOUO) The paper restates that \"All SIGINT and related activities are under the directoperational control of the Director of SID or his designated representative... In short,headquarters elements will exercise operational control of their activity wherever it is foundacross the enterprise. This control includes guidance, tasking, prioritization, and resourceallocation as well as the setting of policy, mission standards and performance metrics.\"(U) COMMAND(U//FOUO) \"None of the above removes the responsibility of a field chief or a site commanderto act as a chief or commander.

Most of your<br>personnel information is in what we'll call the \"HR\" part of CONCERTO.

Obviously your name and your<br>SSN are part of HR CONCERTO for identification purposes. There is also a SECURITY part of<br>CONCERTO. This is where your clearances, etc. are kept. Your name and SSN are also part of<br>SECURITY CONCERTO for identification purposes. The two parts of CONCERTO are kept separate<br>for obvious security reasons, but \"Mary Jane Smith\" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in HR CONCERTO<br>is the same person as \"Smith,Mary Jane\" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in SECURITY CONCERTO.<br>(U//FOUO) SEARCHLIGHT is the Agency's corporate directory service. The \"registration\" of your<br>name and SSN in SEARCHLIGHT (for those of you whose SEARCHLIGHT records are marked<br>\"confirmed\") originated in the HR CONCERTO. In HR CONCERTO, middle initials tend to be more<br>prevalent than middle names. So \"Mary Jane Smith\" may have appeared in SEARCHLIGHT as<br>\"Mary J. Smith\".<br>(U//FOUO) ...ENTER THE PKI CERTIFICATE:<br>(U//FOUO) A required part of creating the PKI certificate, which is used to electronically identify<br>you, is the inclusion of your full name. Because your PKI will be used for identification in<br>electronic systems and exchanges (such as e-mail), the corporate directory system,<br>SEARCHLIGHT, must now have you registered with your full name. Part of your PKI certificate<br>also includes your security credentials and the official source of this information is SECURITY<br>CONCERTO. To get your PKI certificate, your full name must be in SEARCHLIGHT and must<br>match your full name in SECURITY CONCERTO. So, in order to get a PKI certificate, \"Mary J.<br>Smith\" in SEARCHLIGHT must be changed to \"Mary Jane Smith.\" In addition, for those people<br>who did not already have a PKI certificate by March 2003, it is important to know that the name<br>change has already occurred in SEARCHLIGHT. For those who already had a PKI certificate at<br>that time, the name change has been delayed until it is time to renew the PKI certificate. When<br>those people renew their PKI certificate, a process will be triggered to automatically change their<br>SEARCHLIGHT name to match their SECURITY CONCERTO name. If there are any differences<br>between the way names are stored in SEARCHLIGHT and HR CONCERTO, those differences will<br>have to be resolved by contacting Security Information, Q235 with an email to \"ISMT\" (as noted<br>above).<br>(U//FOUO) NAME DIFFERENCES IN PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CERTIFICATES:<br>(U//FOUO) Many of you who have previously received your PKI certificates, did so with your<br>name in SEARCHLIGHT at a time, and in a format, which preceded the \"rollover\" of names from<br>SECURITY CONCERTO.

However, prior discussions recognized this problem and the subsequent<br>impracticality of multiple revocations throughout the agency.

I assume that post in May as an FBI<br>employee. The decision to accept the position was among the most<br>emotion-filled and difficult I've ever made. I feel blessed and deeply honored to be given an<br>opportunity to continue to serve the nation in this new capacity and to work with a team of great<br>Americans dedicated to protecting our homeland. I promise to work hard and do my best for you<br>and yours in this role, and always.<br>(U//FOUO) Timing is everything in life, and it's natural to question mine in making this decision.<br>I did. In the end, I decided that we don't always control the timing of opportunities to serve, and<br>since work is never truly \"done,\" there is never really a \"right\" time to depart. General Hayden<br>will announce my successor in short order and I know that whoever is selected, he or she will be<br>in good hands-- those of the best SIGINT professionals in the world.<br>(C) We have accomplished wonderful things for the nation's SIGINT capability over the past 2<br>1/2 years. It's a universally held view that SIGINT has never been better and that's a tribute to<br>each and every one of you who make it work every single day, sometimes against incredible<br>odds. We all know that there's more work to do, but work doesn't bother us. What amazes me<br>and makes me proud is that we have become a team that does not feel defeated by the<br>difference between where we are and where we want to be, but rather gets energized by it and<br>uses it to spur us to action and success. And succeed we have. You have my deepest respect and<br>admiration today and always.<br>(C) Last week I had the opportunity to walk around in the wee hours of the morning and visit<br>the folks standing watch for Americans in harm's way in Iraq and around the world. That<br>experience was a gift that I will forever cherish. Everywhere I went, I saw what I expected-ruthless focus on the task at hand. I also saw something I didn't expect that delighted me..it<br>was the look and feel of teamwork and empowered professionals with a quiet confidence in our<br>collective ability to get the job done. There wasn't one stop where folks didn't go out of their<br>way to describe the team they were part of that produced the superb results for customers.<br>Thank you all, not just for what you do, but the way you do it.

I assume that post in May as an FBIemployee. The decision to accept the position was among the mostemotion-filled and difficult I've ever made. I feel blessed and deeply honored to be given anopportunity to continue to serve the nation in this new capacity and to work with a team of greatAmericans dedicated to protecting our homeland. I promise to work hard and do my best for youand yours in this role, and always.(U//FOUO) Timing is everything in life, and it's natural to question mine in making this decision.I did. In the end, I decided that we don't always control the timing of opportunities to serve, andsince work is never truly \"done,\" there is never really a \"right\" time to depart. General Haydenwill announce my successor in short order and I know that whoever is selected, he or she will bein good hands-- those of the best SIGINT professionals in the world.(C) We have accomplished wonderful things for the nation's SIGINT capability over the past 21/2 years. It's a universally held view that SIGINT has never been better and that's a tribute toeach and every one of you who make it work every single day, sometimes against incredibleodds. We all know that there's more work to do, but work doesn't bother us. What amazes meand makes me proud is that we have become a team that does not feel defeated by thedifference between where we are and where we want to be, but rather gets energized by it anduses it to spur us to action and success. And succeed we have. You have my deepest respect andadmiration today and always.(C) Last week I had the opportunity to walk around in the wee hours of the morning and visitthe folks standing watch for Americans in harm's way in Iraq and around the world. Thatexperience was a gift that I will forever cherish. Everywhere I went, I saw what I expected-ruthless focus on the task at hand. I also saw something I didn't expect that delighted me..itwas the look and feel of teamwork and empowered professionals with a quiet confidence in ourcollective ability to get the job done. There wasn't one stop where folks didn't go out of theirway to describe the team they were part of that produced the superb results for customers.Thank you all, not just for what you do, but the way you do it. We have changed to meet thechallenges of 21st Century SIGINT and our products and services have never been better. I'venever been prouder to be part of anything and I thank you all for the support andencouragement you have given me along the way. I'll always remember it.(U//FOUO) But just so you don't think I'm going all mushy on you, there's plenty more work todo and there will be more bumps along the road. Please know that I will be cheering you alongas you create the future for SIGINT. You will have a great fan, a trusted partner, and a verydemanding customer at the FBI.

Such information assists the warfighterin planning operations to destroy or disable an underground facility or, in this case, to rescueU.S. personnel and save lives.\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

The success<br>resulted from a lot of hard work and determination on the part of<br>multiple elements of SID, the Extended Enterprise, and the<br>Intelligence Community. Leadership from senior SID and CRD<br>managers provided the key transformational initiative. Three<br>initiatives came together to provide for a successful outcome:<br>A group of representatives from all the intelligence<br>disciplines (SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, MASINT, OSINT)<br>worked for months last autumn to gather, synthesize, and<br>most importantly, map Information Needs to government<br>leadership and military commanders' key decision points.<br>The NSRP system came on-line in mid-summer and was<br>declared operational in early 2003, bringing with it the<br>Customer Information Needs Desk on the NSOC floor.<br>The CRD opened the Requirements Analysis Center (RAC) in<br>late 2002 to manage and adjust the focus of the SIGINT<br>System on the specific INs of the most interest to our<br>customers at any given moment in time.<br>(S//SI) By the end of January, the integrated list of SIGINT<br>Information Needs had been entered into NSRP.

Bycontrast, during the first two weeks following the attacks of 11September 2001, NSOC was flooded with nearly 300 requests forinformation; and by the end of 2001, this number had skyrocketedto nearly 1700.(S//SI) How did this improvement come about? The successresulted from a lot of hard work and determination on the part ofmultiple elements of SID, the Extended Enterprise, and theIntelligence Community. Leadership from senior SID and CRDmanagers provided the key transformational initiative. Threeinitiatives came together to provide for a successful outcome:A group of representatives from all the intelligencedisciplines (SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, MASINT, OSINT)worked for months last autumn to gather, synthesize, andmost importantly, map Information Needs to governmentleadership and military commanders' key decision points.The NSRP system came on-line in mid-summer and wasdeclared operational in early 2003, bringing with it theCustomer Information Needs Desk on the NSOC floor.The CRD opened the Requirements Analysis Center (RAC) inlate 2002 to manage and adjust the focus of the SIGINTSystem on the specific INs of the most interest to ourcustomers at any given moment in time.(S//SI) By the end of January, the integrated list of SIGINTInformation Needs had been entered into NSRP. Since that time,an intensive effort has continued to keep this list up-to-date and toremain closely coupled with the customers' battle rhythm to ensurethat we are focusing on the most important needs and aredelivering the intelligence that counts in time to make a difference.

The idea is to bring together<br>communications from across the SIGINT Directorate in a single webpage. This should provide a<br>good picture of what's going on in SID, and enable easy access. Let's go on a quick tour<br>(U//FOUO) First, at the top of the page are your links to the SID Homepage and NSA Daily.<br>Next, you will notice a big article on the left side of the page. This is the lead message, which<br>will change daily. It may consist of notes from management {the format of the former Messages<br>of the Day} or just general information of interest.

Here are a few terms you may hear:<br>Fence : When NSA funding is fenced, it means we cannot<br>spend those dollars until we satisfy certain requirements<br>levied on us by Congress. Fences are associated with<br>Congressional Directed Actions (CDAs).<br>With/Without Prejudice : When a cut is taken \"with<br>prejudice\", it means that NSA must take the cut from a<br>specified project/program. If a cut is taken \"without<br>prejudice\", we have the option of funding that<br>program/project at the level we requested and taking that<br>cut from elsewhere in the budget.<br>A not A : Appropriated not Authorized. This occurs when<br>the Appropriators provide funding for programs, but the<br>Authorizers do not give NSA the authority to spend it.<br>Hollow Authority : This occurs when the Authorizers give<br>NSA the authority to spend funds, however, the<br>Appropriators do not provide us the with the dollars.<br>Congressional Member/Staffer : The \"member\" is the<br>senator or congressman. The \"staffer\" is just that--one of<br>his staff. The staffers are led by a \"staff director\". Sensitive<br>classified information is sometimes shared only with the<br>staff director and members of Congress--not with the<br>staffers-- to limit distribution as much as possible.<br>(U) Where Are We in This Budget Process Now?<br>(U//FOUO) Right now, the SSCI has just completed its mark up,<br>while the other three committees are still working on theirs. SID LA<br>has just completed many briefings related to the CBJB, to provide<br>clarification or additional detail for the congressional staffers.

Here are a few terms you may hear:Fence : When NSA funding is fenced, it means we cannotspend those dollars until we satisfy certain requirementslevied on us by Congress. Fences are associated withCongressional Directed Actions (CDAs).With/Without Prejudice : When a cut is taken \"withprejudice\", it means that NSA must take the cut from aspecified project/program. If a cut is taken \"withoutprejudice\", we have the option of funding thatprogram/project at the level we requested and taking thatcut from elsewhere in the budget.A not A : Appropriated not Authorized. This occurs whenthe Appropriators provide funding for programs, but theAuthorizers do not give NSA the authority to spend it.Hollow Authority : This occurs when the Authorizers giveNSA the authority to spend funds, however, theAppropriators do not provide us the with the dollars.Congressional Member/Staffer : The \"member\" is thesenator or congressman. The \"staffer\" is just that--one ofhis staff. The staffers are led by a \"staff director\". Sensitiveclassified information is sometimes shared only with thestaff director and members of Congress--not with thestaffers-- to limit distribution as much as possible.(U) Where Are We in This Budget Process Now?(U//FOUO) Right now, the SSCI has just completed its mark up,while the other three committees are still working on theirs. SID LAhas just completed many briefings related to the CBJB, to provideclarification or additional detail for the congressional staffers. Mostof the congressional Requests for Information (RFIs) or briefingsare centered on:SID support to Operation Iraqi Freedom;Data-sharing among Intelligence Community elements(allowing analysts from other agencies access to rawSIGINT data); andTRAILBLAZER.(U//FOUO) The House Appropriations Committee Survey andInvestigations (HAC S&amp;I;) is also investigating metrics for SIGINTcollection programs.

SID has<br>an office that handles its CI Program: the Intelligence Security<br>Issues office. Every day we scan approximately 350 press items for<br>potential CIs. We then research databases to confirm or deny the<br>validity of the CI. This is a vital step in the CI analysis process to<br>determine whether or not to forward the package to NSA's Public<br>Affairs Office (PAO) for tasking. What about SIGINT losses?

It may seem that we<br>just completed an inventory... and you would be correct: the 2002 inventory was completed on<br>6 March 2003 as the result of an extension. The results of that inventory were that only 97% of<br>the equipment was located, or another way to say it was that more then $27M of SID equipment<br>was \"unaccounted for\". The final report for the 2002 inventory has not been signed by the DIR<br>C/S.<br>(U//FOUO) The requirement for Property Accountability is outlined in US law, DOD accounting<br>manuals, NSA/CSS Directives and Regulations. NSA performs inventories for numerous reasons,<br>the first to ensure we can account for the equipment we should have on hand to apply against<br>mission requirements. Another reason is it's the law and we're trying to keep people out of jail.<br>The regulations require that all equipment with an acquisition cost of $5000 or more (as of July<br>2001) and all computers, regardless of cost to include laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc. be<br>accounted for. The entire SID Property Accountability program includes data base management,<br>tagging new equipment, tracking equipment transfers, monitoring the shipping of property and<br>assisting in the turn-in or excessing of equipment. Also included laptop/palmtop inventories,<br>development of Property Policy and assisting in training Property Officers.<br>(U//FOUO) We hope the 2003 inventory will be easier, shorter and will achieve better results.<br>The objective is accounting for 100% of the equipment and we must finish by 31 December<br>2003. We hope that with support from senior SID leadership coupled with buy-in and support at<br>all levels of SID, that this inventory will be more successful, less painful and achieve better<br>results. It will require management awareness and commitment to make it happen. To reach our<br>goal we will need the support of everyone in SID. We hope to get some of the gaps in Property<br>Officers filled, train them and support them in performing their duties.

It may seem that wejust completed an inventory... and you would be correct: the 2002 inventory was completed on6 March 2003 as the result of an extension. The results of that inventory were that only 97% ofthe equipment was located, or another way to say it was that more then $27M of SID equipmentwas \"unaccounted for\". The final report for the 2002 inventory has not been signed by the DIRC/S.(U//FOUO) The requirement for Property Accountability is outlined in US law, DOD accountingmanuals, NSA/CSS Directives and Regulations. NSA performs inventories for numerous reasons,the first to ensure we can account for the equipment we should have on hand to apply againstmission requirements. Another reason is it's the law and we're trying to keep people out of jail.The regulations require that all equipment with an acquisition cost of $5000 or more (as of July2001) and all computers, regardless of cost to include laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc. beaccounted for. The entire SID Property Accountability program includes data base management,tagging new equipment, tracking equipment transfers, monitoring the shipping of property andassisting in the turn-in or excessing of equipment. Also included laptop/palmtop inventories,development of Property Policy and assisting in training Property Officers.(U//FOUO) We hope the 2003 inventory will be easier, shorter and will achieve better results.The objective is accounting for 100% of the equipment and we must finish by 31 December2003. We hope that with support from senior SID leadership coupled with buy-in and support atall levels of SID, that this inventory will be more successful, less painful and achieve betterresults. It will require management awareness and commitment to make it happen. To reach ourgoal we will need the support of everyone in SID. We hope to get some of the gaps in PropertyOfficers filled, train them and support them in performing their duties. As the inventoryprogresses we will use tools such as this to communicate how inventory is going. We need toachieve 100% accountability.(U//FOUO) If you're interested in knowing more about Property Accountability we suggest youvisit the SID Property Web page for a better understanding of what this program is all about.
