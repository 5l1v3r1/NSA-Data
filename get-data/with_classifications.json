Effort\nis linked to the joint SSG/SINIO report on the top 13 technologies, the top 5 are now\nbeing broken down into the level of effort being applied, what NSA\u2019s capability against\nthem is and the degree of budget investment and impact. NSA are looking to improve\ntheir ability to identify new technology trends, the CT product line is already engaged\nand closely partnering with on this, but SSG is now engaging the wider product centres to\nseek the top 2 technologies of interest seen in their domains. NSA POC is\n@nsa.ic.gov), Chief Target Technology Trends Center (T3C)\nShaping \u2013 in this context NSA means increasing cross access coordination efforts. It was\nhighlighted that the definition of \u201cShaping\u201d differs amongst the partners (CSEC and\nGCSB have a narrower definition that is classified at a higher level and focused on\nactivities such as industry engagement and collection bending). NSA is working to\nincrease their focus on router ops, understanding EREPO and increasing CNE survey\nefforts. NSA POC is\n@nsa.ic.gov)\nPattern of life \u2013 increasing NSA capabilities in this realm, working to ensure NSA\ndevelopments in this realm are not made project dependent (ie. Spread algorithms across\ntools/accesses). NSA also see PoL having CND applicability. Current focus includes:\ntravel, FTM, alternate ID, SNA and content mining. NSA POC is\n@nsa.ic.gov)\nIP geolocation \u2013 working to broaden NSA geolocation strategy to cover IP, RF and GSM\nrealms. This imperative has been transitioned out as it\u2019s now considered core business,\nConvergence has taken it\u2019s place in the top 5 imperatives. NSA POC is\n@nsa.ic.gov), NAC TD\nConvergence \u2013 particularly focused on the assessment of Convergence impact upon\nSigint and what Sigint should be concerned about. NSA POC is\n@nsa.ic.gov)\n\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20340601\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\nHuman capitol \u2013 exploring how to train and maintain the NSA analytic workforce, to\ninclude the exploration of certification levels and their associated assessment\nmechanisms. NSA POC is\n(\n@nsa.ic.gov)\nNB: ADD SD reports to NSA leadership quarterly to report on the above and be tasked\nby leadership.\nOther key issues on SSG\u2019s radar for the next year:\nPrivacy issues \u2013 (which includes the issue of 2P auditing).\nexplained that 2 years\nago the SID Director expressed concerns over NSA\u2019s ability to provide oversight and\ncompliance on Sigint data access. It was determined that the Oversight & Compliance\nteam at NSA was under-resourced and overburdened. As a result, there is increasing\neffort to scrutinize who, how and why users have access to NSA databases (to include the\nskill level of analysts who get access). This effort is being worked across S1 and S2, with\nincreasing S3 involvement (as S3 elements do require access to Sigint databases).\nMission delegations are being reviewed more closely and NSA have found that these\ndelegations stretch beyond production centers to include the likes of RAD and ADET.\nIt was flagged by GCSB and DSD that there is no easy equivalent NSA TOPI to sponsor\nand audit analyst accounts. CSEC indicated they had engaged NSA to discuss the\npossibility of CSEC funding audit billets. This was initially shot down but has since come\nback onto CSEC and NSA radars. DSD and GCSB mentioned they are engaging their\nSUSLOs to explore new alternatives to this issue (eg. Use of spouses or interns). There\nwas some mention of AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL possibly also having to consider\nimplementing \u201csuper users\u201d, whereby database accounts are limited to a subset of their\nworkforce and those users run queries for their counterparts.\nCND \u2013\nindicated that this will be a key area of focus and effort for SSG in the\ncoming year, particularly as USCYBERCOM is established. He anticipates there being\nincreasing outreach to key NSA CND elements and stakeholders to see where greater\nSIGDEV support to CND can be provided.\nDevelopments in SD \u2013 GCSB (\n\n)\n\nThe key areas of SD focus for GCSB are:\nSurvey analysis and network analysis capability development - GCSB is establishing\ntheir first Network Analysis team in October 2009, DSD\u2019s\nwill PCS to GCSB\nfor 2 years to lead this team. The new team will initially be focused on access\ndevelopment and is aimed at proving the utility of Network Analysis such that a push can\nbe made for additional GCSB billets (which can then increase support to STATEROOM\nand CNE realms)\nContinued effort against the South Pacific region - GCSB\u2019s access development\nactivities will be focused on the South Pacific region and entail close partnering and\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\nengagement with DSD, NZSIS and ASIS. This is seen as a continuing high priority issue\ngiven the increasing rollout of cable in the South Pacific region\nSIGINT/IA cyber cooperation - GCSB will be running a one month project in Sept/Oct\n2009 involving cooperation and fusing of effort between GCSB SIGINT and GCSB\nInformation Assurance on cyber topics (this effort will include a CSEC TDY).\nbelieves the CND issue may have an added benefit of pushing the priority up on GCSB\ncable access effort and capabilities\nAuditing issue \u2013\nindicated that 20% of GCSB\u2019s analytic workforce does not have\naccounts or access to key NSA databases. This is a particularly significant issue for\nGCSB as they provide NSA with NZL data which they have traditionally accessed via\nNSA tool/database interfaces (ie. GCSB analysts are unable to query or access NZL\ndata). GCSB are also working to gain connectivity to DSD XKEYSCORE (as a first step\ntowards connecting to other 2P XKs)\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\f",

New\nZealand\u2019s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) highly values its\nrelationship with NSA/CSS and will continue to seek and support mutually beneficial\nefforts that demonstrate its commitment to national and international security through its\nforeign partnerships, in spite of budget and other resource challenges.\n(S//REL) GCSB is New Zealand\u2019s operational lead on the cyber threat, giving it impetus\nto be an active participant in the global tipping and cueing architecture as well as\nresources and capabilities to contribute to Five Eyes efforts. GCSB continues to be\nespecially helpful in its ability to provide NSA ready access to areas and countries that\nare difficult for the United States to access. Mr. Ian Fletcher, GCSB Director since\nFebruary 2012, faced his first major challenge when GCSB came under investigation for\nallegedly exceeding its authority when assisting New Zealand law enforcement. The\nreview that followed made several recommendations, some already underway, to\nstrengthen GCSB\u2019s compliance program.\n(U) Key Issues\n(S//REL) GCSB recently gained agreement to roll out a single TOP SECRET\nnetwork across the New Zealand government with all agencies\u2018 TOP SECRET\nnetworks collapsing into a single domain. As part of a strategic decision to\ncollocate intelligence functions, the New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service\n(NZSIS) will move into the new building recently occupied by GCSB with GCSB\nproviding the infrastructure support.\n\n1\n\n(S//REL) AFSC - Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States\n\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20340501\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n(U) What NSA Provides to Partner\n(S//REL) NSA provides raw traffic, processing, and reporting on targets of mutual\ninterest, in addition to technical advice and equipment loans.\n(U) What Partner Provides to NSA\n(TS//SI//REL) GCSB provides collection on China, Japanese/North\nKorean/Vietnamese/South American diplomatic communications, South Pacific Island\nnations, Pakistan, India, Iran, and Antarctica; as well as, French police and nuclear\ntesting activities in New Caledonia.\n(U) Success Stories\n(S//SI//REL)\n\n(S//REL) GCSB is a charter member of SIGINT Seniors Pacific (SSPAC) 2, a group\ncomprising national SIGINT agency leaders from ten countries with interests in the\nPacific Region. GCSB completed its 2-year term as chair of both the SSPAC Executive\nBoard and Analytic Working Group in 2012. During its tenure, GCSB secured active\nparticipation in the forum from previously silent partners, garnered unprecedented high\nlevels of participation in analytic synchronization sessions, and secured a relationship\nbetween SSPAC and SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) 3.\n(U) Problems/Challenges with the Partner\n(S//REL) GCSB continues to focus and invest its limited resources on the highest\nNew Zealand national priorities, with the recent compliance review consuming\nmuch of its resources and attention over the past six months. GCSB\u2019s highest\npriority, cyber, will be developed to meet the demands of the New Zealand\ngovernment and Five Eyes partners.

Threat Overview (U)\n(U//FOUO) Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our assessment on the cyber threat\nto NATO. I would like to start by making a clear distinction between the terms \"cyber\nespionage\" and \"cyber attack\":\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nCyber espionage is the theft of information that is being stored or transmitted as\ndigital data.\nCyber attack refers to malicious activity intended to disrupt data networks or deny\naccess to them, to manipulate or corrupt the data on them, or to cause physical\ndamage to infrastructure and equipment connected to them.\n\n(S//REL NATO) We believe it is important to maintain a clear distinction between cyber\nespionage and cyber attacks because the probability of, consequences from and\nresponse to the two types of cyber incidents are distinctly different. The vast majority of\ncyber incidents against NATO networks are cyber espionage, not cyber attacks.\n(S//REL NATO) We assess that cyber espionage is\u2014and will remain\u2014the principle\nthreat to NATO systems over the next three years. We judge that cyber attacks against\nNATO networks by most nation states, including Russia and China, are unlikely outside\nof the context of a diplomatic or military conflict. However, we are concerned that the\naccess that adversaries gain from cyber espionage activities could accelerate the\ndeployment of cyber attacks in the event of such a conflict.\nB. Specifics (U)\nB1: Threat Actors (U)\n(S//REL NATO) Russia poses the greatest cyber threat to NATO computer networks due\nto its strategic interests, its record of effective cyber collection, and its capability to\ntarget and disrupt NATO and member state computer infrastructures.\n1\nSECRET//REL\u00a0TO\u00a0USA,\u00a0NATO\n\n\fSECRET//REL\u00a0TO\u00a0USA,\u00a0NATO\n\uf0b7\n\n(S//REL NATO) Russia is a robust, multi-disciplinary cyber actor with proven\naccess and tradecraft which can conduct the full scope of operations, including\ncomputer network exploitation, insider-enabled operations, supply-chain\noperations, and computer network attack.\n\n\uf0b7\n\n(S//REL NATO) In addition, Russian nationalist hackers\u2014who previously\nconducted cyber attacks against Estonian and Georgian networks\u2014could target\nNATO systems in the event of a military or diplomatic conflict that pitted NATO\nagainst Russian interests.\n\n(S//REL NATO) China lags behind Russia in terms of sophistication, but the scale and\nscope of their overall cyber activities and their increasing interest in information\nassociated with NATO and its member states makes them the second most strategic\nthreat to NATO networks.\n\uf0b7\n\n(S//REL NATO) Beijing has dramatically expanded its cyber espionage\noperations in the last five years and has conducted network intrusions\u2014probably\nsponsored by the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2014against US military and diplomatic\norganizations.\n\n\uf0b7\n\n(S//REL NATO) We judge that China\u2019s concerns over NATO activities on its\nperiphery, including ISAF operations in Afghanistan, almost certainly would make\nNATO information and networks a target for Chinese cyber espionage.\n\n(S//REL NATO) Although \u201chacktivist\u201d groups such as Anonymous have made headlines\nrecently with their theft of NATO information, the threat posed by such activity is minimal\nrelative to that of nation-states.\n\uf0b7\n\n(S//REL NATO) One area of concern, however, is the possibility of nation-states\nusing hackers as proxies for their own operations. Difficulties with real-time\nattribution make it difficult to quickly identify threats, meaning that cyber\nespionage or cyber attacks can be disguised as cyber-crime or patriotic hacking\nactivity. The example of Russian nationalist hackers targeting Estonia and\nGeorgia serves to underscore this concern.\n\nB2: Methods (U)\n(S//REL NATO)\n(S//REL NATO) We assess that any unclassified NATO network that is directly\nconnected to the Internet should be considered potentially compromised, creating\nuncertainty regarding the confidentiality, integrity and continued availability of all data on\nthat network. Spear phishing, although relatively unsophisticated at a technical level,\nhas proved to be an effective intrusion method for many malicious actors. Full\nimplementation of security best practices would help to significantly reduce the threat of\ncyber espionage against unclassified networks.\nSECRET//REL\u00a0TO\u00a0USA,\u00a0NATO\n\n2\n\n\fSECRET//REL\u00a0TO\u00a0USA,\u00a0NATO\n\n(S//REL NATO) As former deputy secretary of Defense William Lynn pointed out in a\nmedia article, in 2008 classified US military systems were infected with a cyber\nexploitation tool deployed by a foreign nation state, exemplifying the potential threat to\nprotected military networks. We assess that the most immediate threat to classified\nNATO networks are insiders working on behalf of third-party nation states and unwitting\nNATO officers who create vulnerabilities by mishandling classified information systems\nand data, such as emailing classified NATO information through Internet-connected\nsystems or using an infected thumb drive with classified computers. In addition, the\npresence of Russian intelligence officers operating in NATO spaces raises the risk of\nclose access penetrations. Without the implementation of more robust security policies,\nmonitoring tools, and training to counter these factors, we assess that any data on\nclassified NATO networks is at potential risk.\nB3: Other Factors (U)\n(S//REL NATO) The discussion so far today on the threat actors and the methods they\ncould employ represents the standard methodology for discussing and evaluating\npotential solutions to cyber security. A threat-based analytical model is useful for\nunderstanding the problem, but it only captures part of the picture.\n(S//REL NATO) An alternative way to think about the defense of NATO's networks is to\nstart by identifying which NATO data or networks would have the most consequences if\nthey were stolen or disrupted, and work from there. Prioritizing the data and networks\nwe need to protect the most would make it easier to map NATO gaps and vulnerabilities\nto actionable solutions, develop mitigation and response plans, and enable us to better\nallocate scarce resources.\n(S//REL NATO) Separately, NATO\u2019s efforts to work with non-Alliance members on cyber\nsecurity issues are commendable. The Alliance\u2019s ongoing work with the European Union\nand recent discussions on partnering with India only underscore the point that this is a\nglobal issue that affects everyone. We appreciate the Alliance\u2019s efforts to improve its\nown cyber defenses and look forward to continued work in this area.\n\nPrepared by:\n\nJessica Vielhuber\nNIC/CY \u2013 National Intelligence Council\n[REDACTED] (secure)\n\nSECRET//REL\u00a0TO\u00a0USA,\u00a0NATO\n\n3\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": "DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS\nTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL\nSID Today\n\narchives\n\nfeedback\n\nWelcome! Saturday, 10 Nov 2012\n\nSIDtoday Article\nLetter to the Editor\nSIGINT-y Social Media Page\n(TS//SI//REL) Who Else Is Targeting Your Target? Collecting Data Stolen by Hackers\nFROM: (U//FOUO) Menwith Hill Station (F77)\nRun Date: 05/06/2010\n(TS//SI//REL) Hackers are stealing the emails of some of our targets... by collecting the hackers' \"take,\" we 1) get access to the emails themselves and 2) get insights into who's being hacked.\n(TS//SI//REL) People who open attachments from unknown senders (gasp) or respond to \"Nigerian\" money laundering emails aren't the only individuals on the internet being hacked. Some of our targets are also being targeted by outside forces, both by state-sponsored and freelance hackers. Could your target's communications be the\ntarget of other countries or groups?\n(TS//SI//REL) Recently, Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) and Menwith Hill Station (MHS) discovered and began exploiting a target-rich data set being stolen by hackers. The hackers' sophisticated email-stealing intrusion set is known as INTOLERANT. Of the traffic observed, nearly half contains category hits\nbecause the attackers are targeting email accounts of interest to the Intelligence Community. Although a relatively new data source, TOPIs have already written multiple reports based on INTOLERANT collect.\n(U) Technique\n(TS//SI//REL) To the analyst using SIGINT databases, collected INTOLERANT data looks like Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail. In this case, though, the traffic fairy has been hard at work... To hide the traffic, the hackers' programs split a victim's email into pieces. Each piece is then obfuscated, given a different, spoofed,\nsource IP address and sent to a different destination IP address. Having different destination IP addresses serves to route the pieces across separate channels1 of a satellite signal. The channels being used carry large amounts of traffic, allowing INTOLERANT data to hide as background noise. Much collaboration between CSE, MHS,\nGCHQ and NSAW has brought about the transformation of INTOLERANT data we collect into \"readable\" SMTP mail.\n(U//FOUO) Victim Set\n(TS//SI//REL) INTOLERANT traffic is very organized. Each event is labeled to identify and categorize victims. Cyber attacks commonly apply descriptors to each victim - it helps herd victims and track which attacks succeed and which fail. Victim categories make INTOLERANT interesting:\nA = Indian Diplomatic & Indian Navy\nB = Central Asian diplomatic\nC = Chinese Human Rights Defenders\nD = Tibetan Pro-Democracy Personalities\nE = Uighur Activists\nF = European Special Rep to Afghanistan and Indian photo-journalism\nG = Tibetan Government in Exile\n(TS//SI//REL) New victims appear to flood out their entire inbox, going back months or, even, years. Then only new mail is transmitted. Hundreds of emails are seen on an average day.\n(U) Attribution\n(TS//SI//REL) Within the world of cyber exploitation, attribution is always difficult and INTOLERANT is no exception. Initial analysis points toward a likely state sponsor based on the level of sophistication and the victim set. Determining which state is sponsoring the activity has yet to be done. Since the traffic is traveling over satellite,\nthe culprit must be within the satellite beam's footprint to receive the stolen emails. There was hope the footprint would point to which state was responsible, but that hope was not realized as shown in the image.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) Attribution of INTOLERANT data is difficult, since the satellite beam footprint is so large. Eventually, the virtual team working this effort would like to know who is hacking whom.\n(U) Way Forward\n(TS//SI//REL) Analysis continues with the goal of learning more about the attacks as well as improving attribution. Efforts are also being made to inform relevant parties, including NTOC, due to the obvious operations security (OPSEC) concerns where US and UK authorities have contact with Indian diplomats or the European Special\nRepresentative, for instance.\n(TS//SI//REL) So the next time you scan your target's email, pay special attention to the case notation. If it contains 4PXFIL2 (E9BDJ4PXFILtargetNumber in the case of INTOLERANT), then the email is likely available because somebody else has hacked your target. For additional details, send an email to mhsindex@nsa.ic.gov.\n(U//FOUO) POCs: [REDACTED]; INDEX team (MHS)\n(U) Notes:\n1.

(TS//SI//REL) 4PXFIL stands for \"fourth party exfil\" or \"out-sourcing SIGINT.\" These terms are used within the SIGINT community to refer to the practice of collecting data as it transits the Internet going from the victim's computer to the attacker's.\n(U//FOUO) SIDtoday editor's note: This article is reprinted from MHS's Horizon newsletter, March edition.\nComments/Suggestions about this article?\n\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet without the consent of [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]).\"\nInformation Owner: [REDACTED] Page Publisher: [REDACTED]\nLast Modified: 11/10/2012 / Last Reviewed: 11/10/2012\nDYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS\nTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL\nDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108\n\n\f",

So far, we have worked towards making structured datasets available on the high side for analysts to use - this data is available within HAPPY TRIGGER. We are now looking\ntowards making use of more unstructured information (blogs, forums, Twitter). LOVELY HORSE seeks to experiment with provision of an indexed repository of unstructured information that can be used to push content of interest to individual analysts via a variety of mechanisms.\nThe initial LOVELY HORSE prototype can be accessed from here. See below for more details.\n\nSee also \u2014 BIRD SEED\n\nContents\n1 Problem statement\n2 Initial prototype\n2.1 Current sources\n3 Future development concept\n3.1 Team\n3.2 Sources\n3.3 Processing\n3.3.1 Content\n3.3.2 Metadata\n3.3.3 Index\n3.3.3.1 How to generate a pot of tags?\n3.4 Feedback mechanism\n3.5 Visualisation and Access\n4 Your Thoughts\n\n[edit] Problem statement\nAnalysts are potentially missing out on valuable open source information relating to cyber defence because of an inability to easily keep up to date with specific blogs and Twitter sources. Accessing these resources involves using specific JEDI terminals, or reading up at home. We need to make this information available to analysts on the\nhigh side at their normal terminals.\nHowever, there is a balance to be found - analysts don't have the time to spend hours and hours reading through loads of blogs. In addition, we don't want this repository to be yet another tool that analysts have to access - this information needs to be incorporated into existing workflows.\nWe need to find a way to index this information so that analysts only get a relevant subset of this information pushed to them.\n\n[edit] Initial prototype\nWe are working with JTRIG to make use of the existing BIRDSTRIKE architecture for capturing tweets from Twitter. We are also working with CISA around techniques they are developing to capture blog content. Both of these obviously take time, and are slower burn objectives.\nIn the meantime, we are running an initial prototype, where Twitter and (and subject to legal/security approval) blog content is manually scraped and uploaded to GCDesk. This content is accessible by way of personalised RSS feeds. Individual users can choose their preferences, in terms of which Twitter accounts and blogs they want to\nfollow, and a personalised RSS feed is generated automatically for them to which they can subscribe.\nThis can be used by anyone, and can be accessed from here. Your personal RSS is linked from the LOVELY HORSE website.\nAs stated previously, this is a manual update at the moment, and will initially be maintained on a best endeavours basis (hopefully roughly daily). Once the BIRDSTRIKE architecture comes on line, this will be updated in real time.\nFor any requests for new Twitter feeds you wish to be able to subscribe to, please get in touch.\n\n[edit] Current sources\nCurrently, we're bringing in the following list of Twitter accounts. To request new ones, please submit your requests, with a brief justification, via the suggestion box on LOVELY HORSE\n0xcharlie\nalexsotirov\nanonops\nanonymousirc\nanon_central\nanon_operations\nbradarkin\nCeRTFi\ndanchodanchev\ndaveaitel\ndinodaizovi\ndiocyde\negyp7\nGoVCeRT_NL\nhalvarflake\nhdmoore\nhernano\nJaNeTCSiRT\nkevinmitnick\nlennyzeltser\nlulzsec\nmdowd\nmikko\nmsftsecresponse\noperationleaks\nowasp\npusscat\nShadowserver\nsnowfl0w\ntaosecurity\ntaviso\nteamcymru\nthegrugq\nTheHackersNews\ntinman2k\nVuPeN\nWTFuzz\n\n[edit] Future development concept\nThe rest of this page is constituted from ideas that we currently have about LOVELY HORSE.\n\n[edit] Team\nIt will be delivered by TCP's TO144 team.\n\n[edit] Sources\nInitially we need to identify a series of sources. We currently have a list of around 60 blog and Twitter sources that have been identified by CDO analysts and cyber defence experts from Detica, and most of these have been approved for collection by MP-LEG.\nInformation will arrive in unstructured 'information articles'. In the context of a blog, an article would be a post; on Twitter, an article would be a tweet.\nBlog sources:\nThese sources have currently been approved by MP-LEG (see approvals spreadsheet in DISCOVER)\nhttp://www.secureworks.com/research/blog/\nhttp://www.secureworks.com/media/blog/\nxs-sniper.com/blog\nbugix-security.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\ncarnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/rss.xml\nintrepidusgroup/insight/feed\nwww.offensivecomputing.net/?q=node/feed\nrdist.root.org/feed/\nwww.darknet.org.uk\nimthezuk.blogspot.com\ndogber1.blogspot.com/\nwww.ragestorm.net/blogs/\nblog.mandiant.com\nwww.openrce.org\nfeeds.trendmicro.com/Anti-MalwareBlog\nblogs.technet.com/b/msrc/rss.aspx\nblogs.adobe.com/psirt/feed\nThese sources are currently not approved by MP-LEG\nwww.f-secure.com/weblog/weblog.rtf\nwww.f-secure.com/exclude/vdesc-xml/latest_50.rss\nfeeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog\nsecurityvulns.com\nfeeds.feedburner.com/infosecResources\ntargetedemailattacks.tublr.com\n\n\fTwitter sources:\nThe advice from MP-LEG on this issue is that \"provided the accounts you are selecting for acquisition meet the criteria as agreed in the approvals spreadsheet, i.e. those of \u201cacademics specialising in the identification and investigation of vulnerabilities and malware\u201d, there is no need to seek authorisation for each individual Twitter account.\"\nOur selection of Twitter sources is currently as listed above, but will undoubtedly increase over time.\nFurther potential sources of interest are found at Computer_security_news_and_views\n\n[edit] Processing\nInitially, these articles get processed into three components:\n[edit] Content\nThe content will be the full textual content of the article. This will be stored as some sort of CLOB in a database.\n[edit] Metadata\nWe would strip metadata from the article such as\nAuthor/Source\nDatetime of submission\nand used this to update a Source Directory - information about the individual sources. For example:\nAuthor\nNumber of articles in LOVELY HORSE\nAverage usefulness rating - see feedback mechanism\nTags of subject matter linked with this source? - see indexing\n[edit] Index\nThis is the important bit. The aim is to index the unstructured information so that it can be linked back to\nAn analyst's particular interest\nAs enrichment to an existing investigation\nThe proposed idea is to make use of tagging (defining 'indexing' as 'identifying keywords').

How should this alerting happen? Email? RSS feed?\nGeneral search, there should be LOVELY HORSE front end that can be used for analysts to search across the whole repository.

[edit] initial prototype we are working with jtrig to make use of the existing birdstrike architecture for capturing tweets from twitter. we are also working with cisa around techniques they are developing to capture blog content. both of these obviously take time, and are slower burn objectives. in the meantime, we are running an initial prototype, where twitter and (and subject to legal/security approval) blog content is manually scraped and uploaded to gcdesk. this content is accessible by way of personalised rss feeds. individual users can choose their preferences, in terms of which twitter accounts and blogs they want to follow, and a personalised rss feed is generated automatically for them to which they can subscribe. this can be used by anyone, and can be accessed from here. your personal rss is linked from the lovely horse website. as stated previously, this is a manual update at the moment, and will initially be maintained on a best endeavours basis (hopefully roughly daily). once the birdstrike architecture comes on line, this will be updated in real time. for any requests for new twitter feeds you wish to be able to subscribe to, please get in touch.

All SID employees are welcome to attend.\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) Analysts and Mission Managers: On 29 November, SIGINT\nsigned SID Management Directive (SMD) 424, which changes\nprocedures regarding metadata analysis. Specifically, these new procedures\npennit contact chaining, and other analysis, from and through\nany selector, irrespective ofnationality or location, in order to\nfollow or discover validforeign intelligence targets. (Formerly\nanalysts were required to determine whether or not selectors were associated\nv.>ith US communicants.)\n(U) The Impact\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) These new procedures allow NSA to fully exploit\ncommunications metadata (which is strictly defined in the procedures), for\nforeign intelligence purposes, without the restrictions associated with selection\nof communications content. The impact of the new procedures is two-fold. In\nthe first place it allows NSA to discover and track connections between foreign\nintelligence targets and possible 2nd Party or US communicants. In the second\nplace it enables large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of\ncommunications metadata v.>ithout having to check foreignness of every node\nor address in the graph. Analysts in S2 have used this to great benefit over the\npast year and a half under a pilot program.\n\n\f(U) Compliance Issues\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) SIGINT Management Directive 424 (\"SIGINT Development-Communications Metadata Analysis\") provides guidance on the NSA/ CSS\nimplementation of the \"Department of Defense Supplemental Procedures\nGoverning Communications Metadata Analysis\" (SPCMA), as approved by the\nU.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense. The SPCMA covers\ncommunications metadata collected under Executive Order 12333 authorities.\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) As does any new authority or capability, the Supplemental\nProcedures (SPCMA) come with a cost in terms of additional care that we must\ntake '~ith respect to compliance responsibilities and obligations. The\nprimary new responsibility is the requirement:\n\n\u2022 to enter a foreign intelligence (FI) justification for making a query\nor starting a chain,\nand\n\u2022 to perform spot-checks of user qu eries.\nAdditionally, the analyst must remain cognizant of minimization procedures\nassociated with retention and dissemination of US person information.\nSPCMA covers analytic procedures and does not affect existing procedures\nfor collection, retention or dissemination of US person information.\n(S/ SI/ / REL) SPCMA obligations also include the need for additional training\non what the procedures do and do not cover, advisory banners on SPCMA\nenabled metadata databases, query auditing, and annual reports to the\nDepartment of Justice. Details on this implementation are included in\nSMD-424.\n(U) Next Steps\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) In order to take advantage of the Supplemental Procedures\n(SPCMA), analysts v.>ill need to be identified for use of SPCMA through their\nmission-management chain and complete the online informational briefing.\nThis will be managed through GATEKEEPER and/ or the Account Admin\nprocesses. In addition to the required online informational briefmg, a series of\nlive information briefmgs are being planned. The first of these v.>ill be held in\nthe Friedman Auditorium on 7 January from 1000-1130, and is open to all SID\nemployees.\n\n\f(C/ / REL) POCs: TheA&P Product lines have identified the follm\u00a5\ning\nindividuals to be SPCMA POCs for their respective organizations. We\nanticipate that they \\vill be conducting small group SPCMA sessions more\ntailored to their particular missions.\n\n-\n\n(U/ / FOUO) Please consult with your local POCs above, or (in the absence of\none), you may contact- \u00b7 for information.\n\n\f",

    "title": "Malware from the Five Eyes", 
    "doc_text": "Malware from the Five Eyes\nIntroduction\nThe Five Eyes commonly share tools and techniques, and in some occasions also collectively develop new\nones, such as the WARRIORPRIDE malware framework.\nWARRIORPRIDE, as all the malware programs we discovered in Five Eyes' arsenal, is very \ufb02exible and\nversatile. Among the many interception modules WARRIORPRIDE is provided with, the technical research\nteam has obtained a copy of QWERTY - WARRIORPRIDE's component designed to invisibly record all key\nstrokes from an infected Windows computer - from the Snowden Archive.\nDer Spiegel is now releasing QWERTY to the public in order to foster further research and investigations. Der\nSpiegel believes that the release of the malware, which appears to be several years old and likely replaced by\nmore recent variations, will not affect any ongoing operation.\nTechnical Preview\nQWERTY is a keylogger, a plugin for the WARRIORPRIDE malware framework, that is designed to intercept all\nkeyboard keys pressed by the victim and record them for later inspection.\nIts structure is really simple. It's made of a core component called QwertyKM, a driver that interfaces directly\nwith Windows' keyboard manager, and a QwertyLP library which interacts with the driver to retrieve the keys\npressed by the user and keep track of them in a \ufb01le.\nQWERTY is composed of the following binary \ufb01les:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n20120.dll\n20121.dll\n20123.sys\n\nEach one of these components is provided with a structured XML document that de\ufb01nes all available\ncommands as well as dependencies.\nWe learned from Snowden documents that WARRIORPRIDE is the implementation of a CNE library called\nWzowski. In some of the XML documents from QWERTY we \ufb01nd it referenced as a dependency \u2013 WzowskiLib\nv2.1 \u2013 along with a more generic CNELib v2.10.\nAdditionally, we can \ufb01nd hardcoded in one of the binaries the following string:\nC:\\dev\\k1svn\\dsd\\Implants\\WarriorPride\\production2.0\\package\\E_Wzowski\\Release\\E_Qwerty.pdb\nThis strongly con\ufb01rms the connection to WARRIORPRIDE and possibly suggests a relation to the Defense\nSignals Directorate (DSD), now just known as Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), one of the Five Eyes.\nFile\nThe malware samples are contained in a password-protected zip archive (password is \u201cinfected\u201d) attached here\nencoded in base64.\nTo avoid problems with copy and pasting that occur with some PDF readers, the

        "paragraph_text": "malware from the five eyes introduction the five eyes commonly share tools and techniques, and in some occasions also collectively develop new ones, such as the warriorpride malware framework. warriorpride, as all the malware programs we discovered in five eyes' arsenal, is very exible and versatile. among the many interception modules warriorpride is provided with, the technical research team has obtained a copy of qwerty - warriorpride's component designed to invisibly record all key strokes from an infected windows computer - from the snowden archive. der spiegel is now releasing qwerty to the public in order to foster further research and investigations. der spiegel believes that the release of the malware, which appears to be several years old and likely replaced by more recent variations, will not affect any ongoing operation. technical preview qwerty is a keylogger, a plugin for the warriorpride malware framework, that is designed to intercept all keyboard keys pressed by the victim and record them for later inspection. its structure is really simple. it's made of a core component called qwertykm, a driver that interfaces directly with windows' keyboard manager, and a qwertylp library which interacts with the driver to retrieve the keys pressed by the user and keep track of them in a le. qwerty is composed of the following binary les: 20120.dll 20121.dll 20123.sys each one of these components is provided with a structured xml document that denes all available commands as well as dependencies. we learned from snowden documents that warriorpride is the implementation of a cne library called wzowski. in some of the xml documents from qwerty we nd it referenced as a dependency  wzowskilib v2.1  along with a more generic cnelib v2.10. additionally, we can nd hardcoded in one of the binaries the following string: c:\\dev\\k1svn\\dsd\\implants\\warriorpride\\production2.0\\package\\e_wzowski\\release\\e_qwerty.pdb this strongly conrms the connection to warriorpride and possibly suggests a relation to the defense signals directorate (dsd), now just known as australian signals directorate (asd), one of the five eyes. file the malware samples are contained in a password-protected zip archive (password is infected) attached here encoded in base64. to avoid problems with copy and pasting that occur with some pdf readers, the following command line can be used on a linux system to easily extract the zip le from this pdf: pdftotext lename.pdf -|grep -v grep|grep aaaaa -a 1000|tr -d '\\014'|sed -e '/^$/d'|base64 -d > malware.zip the resulting zip le should have the sha1sum f4fa863426136d0006f897b8a1dd21d2ad83866c. uesdbaoaaaaaag10luyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahabwacxdlcnr5l1vucqadhr+1vb4ftvr1easaaqto

POLICY STATEMENT\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1.1 This policy defines the use of mobile phones by Tryst Travellers deployed\noverseas. It has been agreed between OPA-TAS and PISECGIAS and is to\nbe read by all officers prior to deployment overseas.\n1.1.2 It is OPA-TAS policy for officers to adopt best practice in the use of covert\nmobile phones when deployed overseas in order to ensure both their own\npersonal security and GCHQ\u2019s operational security. This policy dictates the\nuse of FCO provided non-attributable official and personal mobile phones by\nofficers while on deployment.\n\n2. Operating Rules\n1.1.3 Official mobile phones are accountable items and must be signed for when\ntaken from the OPA-TAS secure store.\n1.1.4 The mobile phones and the accessories must be returned to OPA-TAS on\nreturn to the UK. Failure to do so may preclude future travel.\n1.1.5 Official phones are to be used only for official business in country and\nMUST not be used to make personal calls to the UK. If a call is unavoidable\nthen only out of area numbers can be called, these are:\nGSOC TRYST OOA \u2013 0207\nTAS TRYST OOA \u2013 0207\n1.1.6 To avoid compromise the following must be adhered to:\nThe covert mobile phones are equipped with BLUETOOTH and therefore\nthey MUST not be switched on or used within a 50-mile radius of\nCheltenham and within this radius the battery must be removed from the\nphone.\nThe covert mobile phone MUST NOT be recharged at the officer\u2019s home\naddress or at temporary residence e.g. a hotel room, if it is within the 50\nmiles radius. If a phone needs to be charged then it is acceptable to do\nso either at the airport or at your destination.\nPage 5 of 6\n\nSECRET\nThis information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption\nunder other UK information legislation.

Welfare\n1.1.8 It is recognised that officers who are departing from, or have recently arrived\nin the UK may wish to advise family or friends of disruption to their travel\nplans.

Cusick, Director Foreign Affairs (DIRFA)\nBACKGROUND: (U//FOUO) As General Alexander\u2019s UK counterpart, Sir Iain has visited\nNSA on several occasions as one would expect, both in his current position and previous ones.\nSir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air Chief Marshal\nSir Stuart Peach. That visit had a more defined purpose of introducing Sir Stuart to\nUSCYBERCOM and NSA leadership as the Commander of the UK\u2019s newly-established Joint\nForces Command. This will be the first visit in some time that will allow the visitor to reconnect\nwith NSA Leadership on NSA/GCHQ matters.\nPURPOSE OF THE VISIT: (U//FOUO) As the Director of GCHQ, Sir Iain wants to reconnect\nwith NSA Leadership on matters of mutual concern, and to ensure each partner is aware of the\nother\u2019s activities and future plans.\nCDR/DCDR/DDIR GUIDANCE: (U) N/A\nPREP SESSION GUIDANCE: (U//FOUO) NONE\nNSA/CSS REQUESTED: (U//FOUO) NONE\nCYBERCOM REQUESTED: (U//FOUO) NONE\nKEY TOPIC AREAS:\n(TS//SI//NF) FAD and SUSLOL are not aware of any particular issues that Sir Iain will want to\naddress. NSA leadership should still be aware of the following topics that may pertain to their\norganizations or areas of responsibility, as the potential exists for them to be brought up by the\nvisitor:\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) FAA 702 Data: Unsupervised access to FAA 702 data, in a manner similar\nto Olympics Option, remains on GCHQ\u2019s wish list and is something its leadership still\ndesires. NSA and SID leadership are well aware of GCHQ\u2019s request for this data, and the\nsteps necessary for approval. NSA leadership could be asked whether we\u2019re still\nsupportive of this initiative. On a related topic, progress continues on \u201cTriage 2.0,\u201d\nGCHQ access to FAA 702 data under supervised conditions. The MOA is now back in\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRET//SI //NOFORN\n\n\fTOPSECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nGCHQ\u2019s court awaiting signature. With that said, GCHQ seems less enthused about\nTriage, perhaps in part because of the long steps necessary to gain approval. For\nadditional background about these topics, see the attached paper that Mr.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXX, SID Associate Deputy Director, Counterterrorism\n(ADD/CT) SIGINT Authorities Lead, NSA/CSS Counterterrorism Mission Management\nCenter (CTMMC) prepared for D/DIR\u2019s April 2013 UK visit.\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) UK Intelligence Community Oversight: GCHQ and its sister intelligence\nagencies are challenged with their activities and operations being subject to increased\nscrutiny and oversight from their government (and public). As a result, closer attention is\nbeing paid to how UK-produced intelligence data is being used by NSA, and other\npartners. It is possible that Sir Iain may ask about what safeguards NSA may be putting\nin place to prevent UK data from being provided to others, the Israelis for instance, who\nmight use that intelligence to conduct lethal operations. For additional information about\nthis subject, and other UK Intelligence Community legal issues and legislation, see the\nattached paper prepared by Mr. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Office of the General Council, London.\n\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Syria: Prime Minister Cameron continues to look to the UK security and\nintelligence agencies for recommended courses of action to influence the outcome in\nSyria, but to this point GCHQ has not offered much beyond messaging and limited online\neffects operations. GCHQ\u2019s ability to contribute significantly to the overall Syria SIGINT\neffort is hampered by GCHQ\u2019s limited resources. It should be noted that the UK\nIntelligence Community is just as concerned about the end state of Syria\u2019s chemical and\nbiological weapons as the U.S. Intelligence Community. Sir Iain may want to discuss\nSyria\u2019s use of chemical weapons and how the U.S. Government intends to react. For\nmore information about NSA\u2019s posture against Syria, see attached Near East Divisionproduced paper on Syria.\no (TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Points: Syria remains\nlocked in a protracted struggle, with both the opposition and the regime firmly\nentrenched in their positions. Attempts to coalesce the opposition have moved\nextremely slowly, while the regime has not in any way indicated that it would\nwillingly stand aside. Given this lack of movement in negotiations and the\nstalemate on the ground, we anticipate the conflict will not be resolved in an\nexpedient manner.\no (TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA continues to monitor the situation in\nSyria from all angles, including from the viewpoint of the regional, international,\nand radical actors. NSA remains concerned about chemical weapons security and\ncontinues to monitor the situation closely, to the best of our ability.\n\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Iran: GCHQ and the UK Government remain concerned about events in\nIran and the possibility that tensions with the West or Israel could escalate. The visitor\nmay ask NSA and SID leadership to share their views on what is going to happen with\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRET//SI //NOFORN\n\n\fTOPSECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nIran, to include potential Israeli response. For information about NSA\u2019s posture against\nIran, see attached Iran Division produced paper on Iran.\no (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Point: Emphasize that we have\nsuccessfully worked multiple high-priority surges with GCHQ that have allowed\nus to refine maintaining mission continuity and seamless transition, and maximize\nour target coverage. These jointly-worked events include the storming of the\nBritish Embassy in Tehran, Iran\u2019s discovery of FLAME, and support to\npolicymakers during the multiple rounds of P5 plus 1 negotiations.\n-\n\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, GBR) Global Collaboration Environment (GCE): On 2 April\n2013, SID Foreign Partner Strategist (FPS) Mr. XXXXXXXX, held a discussion with\nMr. XXXXXX (Head of Bilateral and Multilateral Relations, GCHQ International\nRelations) to discuss the future of GCE in a post-Afghanistan era. GCE is the next\ngeneration of PARTNERMALL (PMP) and should be the future partner collaboration\nsolution of choice. GCE expands the current single collaboration environment PMP\ncapability into a bilateral and multilateral model. The two discussed the benefits of NSA\nand GCHQ having a united front in its dealings with the other foreign partners on this\nissue. They also discussed the possibility of the UK hosting a permanent facility where\nanalysts from partner nations could be co-located, along with ways to better integrate\nGCE into each partner\u2019s analytic workflow. For information about this discussion, see\nthe attached paper prepared by SID\u2019s Foreign Partner Strategist Office.\no (S//REL TO USA, GBR) Director Talking Points: Thank GCHQ for giving full\nsupport to GCE, and for partnering with NSA to engage in synchronized\nmessaging to other organizations.\no (S//REL TO USA, GBR) Encourage GCHQ to host the permanent facility for the\njoint SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) collaboration center, in order to maximize\nthe benefit for the Five Eyes partnership.\no (S//REL TO USA, GBR) Offer NSA\u2019s assistance in finding good solutions for\nincorporating GCE access into GCHQ\u2019s analytic workflow. Encourage GCHQ to\nengage with NSA\u2019s TD on this subject.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: (U//FOUO) See above.\nVISIT FORMAT: (U//FOUO) General Alexander will host a dinner in honor of Sir Iain at his\nresidence on 30 April 2013. The two directors will also have a one-on-one discussion on 1 May\n2013. The remainder of Sir Iain\u2019s agenda will involve NTOC and TAO tours/demos, along with\ndiscussions with NSA Leadership, including Ms. Teresa H. Shea, SIGINT Director, Mrs. Debora\nA. Plunkett, IAD DIR, Mr. Rajesh De, General Council, Mr. Wayne M.

Sir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air\nChief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach. During that visit, Sir Iain met with General Alexander,\nMr. Inglis, and other NSA and USCYBERCOM leaders.\nPOTENTIAL LANDMINES: (TS//SI//NF) GCHQ has long advocated that it work with NSA\nand the Israeli SIGINT Service (ISNU) in a trilateral arrangement in prosecuting the Iranian\ntarget. SID policy has been opposed to such a blanket arrangement, and the specific trilateral\nexplained in the attached paper on Iran should not be interpreted as a broad change of approach.\nIn other areas, NSA and GCHQ have agreed to continue to share information gleaned from the\nrespective bilateral relationships with ISNU.\nOTHER INFORMATION (GOOGLE SEARCH, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS,\nINTERESTING FACTS, NCR/LNO ADVICE\u2026) (U) NONE\nRECENT PRESS INDICATIONS: (U) N/A\n\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRET//SI //NOFORN\n\n\f",

Access to these databases is restricted to analysts who hold the\nRAGTIME ECI, have a specific 'need to know' about the data stored within the databases, and who\nare authorized by the data owner.

CES believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the\nclassification of the data before it is fed into our systems. This is an ongoing issue which should not\nimpede the approval of this SPF but the matter should be addressed.

This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classification instructions,\nwhile classification guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an NSAlCSS FISAlProtect America Act\n(PAA)IFISA Amendments Act (FAA) classification guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will\nreference an NSAlCSS FISAlPAAlFAA classification guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by\nthe FISC. Also, this document references classification guidelines for FISAIPAAlF AA information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information\n(ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classification. Additional Annexes are\nprovided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.\n(TS//SI/INF) The markings \"TSP\" and \"Compartmented\" were at times used in briefing materials and documentation associated with the\nSTELLAR WIND program. \"TSP\" and \"Compartmented\" were used primarily by the National Security Agency (NSA) Legislative Affairs Office\n(LAO), NSA Office of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in briefings and declarations intended for external audiences, such as\nCongress and the courts. The term \"TSP\" was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//ORCONINOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISIJ/ORCONINOFORN\n\nPresident in December 2005. These markings should be considered the same as the STELLARWIND marking, but should not be directly\nassociated with the program.

ransom calls\ncan\u2019t risk bringing attention to low-population rural area\nwon\u2019t use phone for any other comms (or uses payphones ...)\n\nAssumption: He has another device that accesses IP\nnetworks from public access points\nhaving a device isn\u2019t necessary, could use internet cafes, libraries etc.\nhe is also assumed to use IP access around the time of ransom calls\n\nQuestion: Knowing the time of the ransom calls can we\ndiscover the kidnapper\u2019s IP ID/device\n\u201ccontact chain\u201d across air-gap (not a correlation of selectors)\n\n21\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nSolution Outline\nWith earlier IP profiling analytics, we can \u201csweep\u201d a\ncity/region to discover and determine public accesses\nWe can then select which IP network IDs are seen as active\nin all times surrounding the known ransom calls\nreduce set to a shortlist\n\nThen we examine the reduced set of IP network IDs and\neliminate baseline heavy users in the area that fall into the\nset intersection just because they are always active\nthat is, eliminate those that are highly active outside the times of the ransom\ncalls\nhopefully leaves only the one needle from the haystack\n\n22\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nFirst Proof-of-Concept\nSwept a modest size city and discovered two high traffic\npublic access ranges with >300,000 active IDs over 2 weeks\nused for initial expediency due to computational intensity\n\nPresumed that there were 3 ransom calls, each 50 hours\napart during daytime, looked for IDs within 1 Hr of calls\nreduce large set to a shortlist of just 19 IP network IDs\n\nExamined activity level of 19 IP network IDs \u2013 how many\npresences each had in 1 Hr slots over two weeks\nmain worry as the computation was running: there would be a lot of IDs that\nshowed just a handful of appearances: e.g. 3, 4, 5 instances\n\n23\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nID Presence of Shortlist\nEach horizontal line shows presence of ID over time/hour-slots\n\nTime/hour-slots \u2192\n\nPostulated presence of kidnapper/target\n\nHappy result: least active ID had appearances in 40 hour-slots!\nThus could eliminate all, leaving just the kidnapper (if he was there)\n24\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nBig-Data Computational Challenge\nAll the previous analytics, while successful experimentally,\nran much too slowly to allow for practical productization\nCARE: Collaborative Analytics Research Environment\na big-data system being trialed at CSEC (with NSA launch assist)\nnon-extraordinary hardware\nminimal impedance between memory, storage and processors\nhighly optimized, in-memory database capabilities\ncolumnar storage, high performance vector functional runtime\npowerful but challenging programming language (derived from APL)\n\nResult of first experiments with CARE: game-changing\nrun-time for hop-profiles reduced from 2+ Hrs to several seconds\nallows for tradecraft to be profitably productized\n\n25\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nOverall Summary\nIP profiling showing terrific value\nsignificant analytic asset for IP networks and target mobility\nenables critical capability within Tipping & Cueing Task force\nworking to productize on powerful new computational platform\nbroader SSO accesses/apertures coming online at CSEC\nlook to formalize models & fold-in timing deltas\n\nA new needle-in-a-haystack analytic is viable: contact\nchaining across air-gaps\nenabled by sweep capability of IP profiling\nshould test further to understand robustness with respect to loosening\nassumptions of target behaviour\nbeyond kidnapping, tradecraft could also be used for any target that makes\noccasional forays into other cities/regions\n\n26\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nTradecraft Studio Example\n\nPossible route for productizing analytics\n27\n\n\f",

The objectives defining the scope of this\nresearch activity are:\n1) (S//REL) To assess if it is to NSA\u2019s benefit to continue research into whether\npractical-scale QC can be developed within a reasonable timeframe, to identify its most\npromising physical embodiment(s), and to formulate a credible scenario for its large-scale\ndevelopment;\n2) (U//FOUO) To gain an understanding of the computational cryptanalytic capabilities\nof quantum computers; and\n3) (U//FOUO) To identify practical cryptographic methods that are not susceptible to\nquantum computational attack.\n(S//REL) These guidelines do not cover the possibility of large-scale cryptologic QC\ndevelopment programs at NSA, but only the research and planning preliminary to, and in\npossible support of, such programs.\n(S//SI//REL) Much of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most\neffectively pursued in NSA-funded open research programs. These programs play a critical role\nas the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the field. However, NSA\nis pursuing more than just basic, unclassified research. NSA is also attempting to preserve the\nSIGINT potential of quantum computing (i.e., the cryptanalytic applications of QC) while\nsimultaneously attempting to protect the information security of both the Government and\nprivate sectors against hostile QC attacks (i.e., the cryptographic, mission assurance applications\nof QC of interest to the Information Assurance community). These goals must be pursued at the\nclassified level.\n(U//FOUO) There are several fundamental reasons for classifying QC research:\n\n1) (TS//SI//REL) To protect NSA\u2019s efforts to develop cryptanalytic QC to attack highgrade public key encryption systems by denying adversaries information concerning\nNSA\u2019s assessment of, and/or plans for, large-scale QC development;\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n2) (S//REL) To enable us to track our adversaries\u2019 degree of success or failure in similar\nQC development efforts; and\n3) (U//FOUO) To protect our own systems against adversarial cryptanalytic QC efforts.\n(S//REL) Based on this, the distinctions between unclassified and classified information\ncontained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassified basic-level, academic-scale\nresearch of scientific interest, and more comprehensive classified research which might disclose\ntechniques that may otherwise be possible to protect, or which might imply, rightly or wrongly,\nserious intent on NSA\u2019s part to pursue large-scale development of cryptanalytic quantum\ncomputers.\nDescription of Information\n\nClassification/\nMarkings\n\nCategory\n\nDeclass\n\nRemarks\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n(U) Details may require handling\nas UNCLASSIFIED//FOR\nOFFICIAL USE ONLY or may be\nclassified.\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n(U) Details may require\nclassification and may be\ncompartmented.\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n(U) Details, including specifying\nwhich U.S. organization, may\nrequire handling as\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR\nOFFICIAL USE ONLY or may be\nclassified.\n\nA.

A more specific definition is likely to\nbe compartmented, and will change over time.\n(U) Cryptography - The principles, means, and methods for rendering plain information\nunintelligible to the uninitiated and for restoring encrypted information to intelligible form.\n(U) Cryptology - The art and science of making codes/ciphers and breaking them,. Cryptology\nbreaks out into two disciplines: cryptography (making or using codes/ciphers) and cryptanalysis\n(breaking codes/ciphers).\n(U) Detailed engineering design - Specifications of a set of qubits and the associated\ninitialization, control, and measurement hardware and software at a level of detail commensurate\nwith the requirements of industrial fabrication.\n(U) Fidelity - Precision of qubit operations such as initialization, logic gates, and readout.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n(U) High-fidelity N-qubit Device - An engineered processing device that integrates N coupled,\nhigh-fidelity physical qubits, i.e., qubits with fidelity of operations near or beyond the accuracy\nthreshold for efficient error correction.\n(S//REL) Level A QC - Unclassified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design,\nphysical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory\nfor Physical Sciences/R3.\n(S//REL) Level B QC - Classified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design,\nphysical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory\nfor Physical Sciences/R3. The boundaries are based on the number and quality of qubits, realism\nand specificity of design, control precision, and detail of analysis. While these boundaries may\nchange over time, as of the publication of this guide, the values are:\n(1) (S//REL) Detailed engineering design of 51 or more physical qubits;\n(2) (S//REL) Implementation and operation of a high-fidelity 21-or-more physical-qubit\ndevice; or\n(3) (S//REL) Implementation and operation of three (3) or more logical qubits, with\nsufficient speed and precision to allow preservation of quantum information and logical\ngates between the qubits.\n(U) Logical qubits - Collections of several physical qubits configured in a circuit allowing\ndetection and correction both of errors and of loss of quantum coherence.\n(U) For the purposes of this guide, the circuit configuration of a logical qubit must allow\ndetection and correction of at least all errors affecting any single physical qubit. A logical\nqubit comprising N physical qubits must also be a high-fidelity N-qubit device.\n(U) Physical qubit - A physical entity capable of storing a qubit of information and being\ninitialized, operated on, and measured. Examples include, but are not limited to: photons,\nelectrons, atoms, atomic nuclei, and superconducting Josephson junctions.\n(S//SI//REL) Practical-Scale - Cryptanalytic-scale, with the added requirement that a roadmap\nexists to construct the device with a cost, probability of success, and time-scale of actual\ncryptanalytic importance to NSA. A more specific definition is likely to change over time.\n(U) Quantum coherence - The fundamental quantum-mechanical property of qubits and\ncollections of qubits which may enable some computations to be performed with resources vastly\nsmaller than would be required for classical computers.\n(U) Quantum Computing - Computing with quantum operations on data stored in a collection\nof qubits.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n(U) Quantum gates - Logic operations on one or more qubits that preserve their quantum\ncoherent character.\n(U) Qubit - A \u201cquantum bit,\u201d the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\f",

Each section includes a brief description of\nthe analytic, its status, source data, and caveats.\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) While each analytic was designed to operate on a particular type of data or a\nparticular data format, many can likely be scaled to operate on other data sources. For instance,\nanalytics designed for DNR GCID or VLR data might also apply to DNI Geolocation data.\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The process of documenting these analytics raised a series of important issues\nthat not only distinguish the analytics from each other, but more importantly, shape the landscape\nthat we must consider in moving forward to meet the analytic needs at NSA. Some of these issues are\ndiscussed in the next section.\n\nIssues and Questions\nShould a co-travel analytic consider where a GCID or VLR is physically located?\no Many GSM analytics use GCID information to identify co-travelers. If two selectors are seen\nat the same GCID around the same time, they are considered co-travel candidates. The\nanalytic does not need to know where the GCID is physically located. However, if the\nindividuals are using different network providers (e.g., T-Mobile and Verizon), they may be\nphysically standing next to each other as their mobiles register with different cell towers.\nCo-travel analytics that do not consider the physical geo-locations of the towers will not\ndiscover individuals that are co-traveling on different networks.\no Analytics that make use of point data (e.g., Thuraya) necessarily need to consider\ngeolocational data in order to determine distance from one point to another.\nShould incidental co-travelers be considered?\no There is a difference between incidental co-travel due to collective movement (individuals\nwith similar travel behaviors but no other similarities) and functional group-based co-travel\namong individuals with behaviorally relevant relationships. CTCOP makes this definition\nexplicit, but warns that we might not want to exclude seemingly incidental co-travelers\nsimply because we are unaware of their relationship.\no Other factors, such as contact chains and target COMSEC behaviors (frequent power-down,\nhandset swapping, SMS behavior), might assist in determining whether co-travelers are\nassociated through their travel behaviors alone or through behaviorally relevant\nrelationships.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n3\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nShould geography play a role in co-travel?\no Because it is difficult to know where a GSM target is located within a GCID or VLR, many of\nthe GSM co-travel analytics use the mathematical central point in the VLR or GCID as a\nreference point. We could postulate that traveling targets will be located along roads, train\ntracks, or footpaths where network service exists. This type of geographical information\ncould theoretically be used to inform a co-traveler analytic in identifying candidates\n(especially those that are traveling via the same means of transportation). Geographical\ninformation might also be used to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d when data is missing between locations\nthat a target visited.\no Analytics in this study that make use of such geographical information include DSD\u2019s Cotravel analytic and the Geospatial Analysis Tradecraft Center\u2019s (GATC\u2019s) Opportunity Volume\nanalytic.\nShould device and collection sampling play a role in determining co-travelers?\no We may collect hundreds of events from one target\u2019s mobile phone while collecting only a\nfew events from his co-traveler\u2019s mobile phone. The number of events collected may be due\nto collection bias, differences in network service, and/or target COMSEC behavior. Analytics\nshould take these considerations into account when attempting to identify co-travelers.\nShould co-travelers seen in different source databases be considered?\no Depending on a target\u2019s preferred communication behaviors, some co-travelers may be\nseen largely in DNR GSM data, and other co-travelers may be seen largely in DNI data. We\nmay be able to construct a more complete picture of a target\u2019s locations over time if we\ncombine DNR and DNI data sources. It might be worth considering the degree to which\nconsidering multiple data sources will significantly increase the number of false positives.\no Databases that do not contain geolocation information might also be considered. For\ninstance, air travelers on the same reservation number are probably co-traveling on the\nsame flight. Users sharing a MAC address are probably co-located using the same device\neven though we may not know where that device is located. Consistent observations of\ndevices within the same LAIC may provide evidence of co-location, even if the LAIC\u2019s\nphysical service area is unknown. Finally, similarities between IP addresses may indicate\nproximity on the same LAN, even if the physical location of the LAN nodes is unknown.\no The one analytic in this study that attempts to combine multiple sources of information to\nbuild a more holistic picture of a target\u2019s travel pattern is the TAC/Caf\u00e9/TMAC Co-travel\nanalytic.\nCan co-travel be considered a series of meetings?\no We attempted to limit this study to targets co-traveling through two or more locations\nwithin an analyst-specified time and space window. If those locations are defined, however,\nwe might consider co-travel as a series of \u201cmeetings\u201d at known locations. Analytics that\ndetect co-location may be different in nature from those that detect co-travel. The specific\nanalytic need will define which of these approaches is more appropriate and efficient.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n4\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\no\n\nIn this study, examples of meeting analytics that detect instances of co-location include the\nGATC Opportunity Volume Analytic and the\nMeet&Greet Spatial Chaining Analytic.\n\nAnalytics\nCHALKFUN\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Chalkfun\u2019s Co-Travel analytic computes the date, time, and network location\nof a mobile phone over a given time period, and then looks for other mobile phones that were seen in\nthe same network locations around a one hour time window. When a selector was seen at the same\nlocation (e.g., VLR) during the time window, the algorithm will reduce processing time by choosing a few\nevents to match over the time period. Chalkfun is SPCMA enabled1.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Note: As of 6 September 2012, the events that are chosen depend on the\n\u201csampling method\u201d chosen by the analyst (most active, most per day, first/last/most, or\nfirst/last/spread). The \u201csampling rate\u201d specifies how many events are chosen to match. As Chalkfun\nmoves to the cloud, this option will be discontinued.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The cloud-based version of Chalkfun (see R6 SORTINGLEAD Co-traveler\nAnalytic section), which may be released as early as September 2012, will have a number of additional\nfeatures and options:\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe system will run one query (rather than separate queries) for all of the IMSIs, MSISDNs, VLRs,\nand GCIDs that an analyst enters (as if the selectors and areas of interest were joined with an\n\u201cOR\u201d). The system currently runs separate queries for each, returning separate sets of results for\neach combination of selector and areas of interest. The cloud-based version will also enable the\nuser to set the size of the time window that the analytic considers, rather than defaulting to one\nhour (as described above).\nThe user will be able to choose the countries or locations of interest. Blacklist and whitelist\nfeatures will enable the user to instruct the system to ignore activity within a region, or restrict\nanalysis to specified regions of interest (e.g., ignore activity in\nor use only activity from\n)\nIn considering potential co-travelers, the analyst will have the option to ignore activity in which\nthe target is in his home country\n\n1\n\n(S//SI//REL) SPCMA enables the analytic to chain \"from,\" \"through,\" or \"to\" communications metadata fields\nwithout regard to the nationality or location of the communicants, and users may view those same\ncommunications metadata fields in an unmasked form.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n5\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\uf0b7\n\nThe analyst will be able to filter in or out potential co-travelers with specified prefixes (for\ninstance, return only\nmobiles, remove all\nmobiles, them, or include only mobiles\nthat are from the same country as the target).\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n- Operational; Available at\nanalysts desktops\n- Cloud version could be\navailable as early as September\n2012.\n\nSource Data\n- All FASCIA data containing VLR\nand GCID information\n\nCaveats\n- Current version is not cloudbased and can have long\nprocessing times, however\ncloud-based solution is\nimminent.\n- Analytic will only return cotravelers on the same provider\nnetwork\n\nDSD Co-Travel Analytic\nBackground\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DSD Co-Travel analytic predicts target locations and co-travelers by\ncalculating time-based travel trajectories. Probable travel routes are calculated using observed locations\nand determining the most likely paths and travel times similar to that used in turn-by-turn navigation\nsystems. These target travel paths are represented as a series of LAT/LONG waypoints or line segments\nalong the probable travel routes, such as roads. The travel paths are divided into segments (e.g. 20 to\n50km along the road). The analytic predicts the approximate time that the target would theoretically\narrive at each segment waypoint based on projected travel times between known locations. Then,\nwithin the travel window, the analytic discovers candidate co-travellers that intersect locations along\nthe buffered travel path. The next step in the analytic is performed using interactive Renoir analysis of a\ntwo mode graph representing the route segments and selectors observed on these route segments\nwithin the time windows. Once the data is clean and candidate co-travellers are identified detailed\nanalysis can be done in Renoir or other tools such as GeoTime incorporating other supporting data such\nas communications events and content.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic currently runs on a Netezza-based architecture, called Hectic\nSnare, that rapidly executes MySQL-based QFDs. This architecture enables interactive exploratory\nanalysis and rapid pattern matching. The analytic is distributable and could be implemented in\nHadoop/MapReduce or Accumulo.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic was tested using an\nterrorist case study. The case\nstudy used approximately 80,000 base stations locations and 16 billion mobiles location records for\nCDRs (Call detail records) and infrastructure collect from DRT and Juggernaut systems. This case study\nshowed that more candidate co-travellers were discovered by analyzing the travel paths than by\nconsidering common meeting locations alone.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n6\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\nAnalytic implemented and\ntested at DSD.\n\nSource Data\n- Mobile CDRs and residing in\nNetezza-based architecture.\n\nCaveats\n- Requires Netezza (current\nimplementation)\n- Requires Renoir\n\nFuture Work\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) DSD would like to integrate key meeting locations into this analytic, such as\nsafehouses. Plans are also underway to identify targets based on COMSEC behaviors such as identifying\nmobiles that are turned off right before convergence between two travel paths occurs.\n\nGeospatial Analysis Tradecraft Center (GATC) Opportunity Volume\nAnalytic\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The opportunity volume analytic determines whether two entities (e.g.\ndevices) could have been co-located by considering the possibility of their travel paths intersecting. The\nopportunity volume analytic requires pairs of event locations and times for each entity, and computes\nthe possible locations and times in which the two entities could have been co-located. It does this by\ncomputing possible travel route surfaces for each entity between the specified events, using a travel\ncost surface computed from terrain, land cover, and road network data. These possible travel route\nsurfaces include the temporal dimension (that is, the period of time in which the entity could have been\nat the given location); the intersection between these multidimensional surfaces represents the places\nand times during which the entities could have been co-located. The analytic was developed using GPS\npoint event data, but the analytic actually uses a 1-km grid for the spatial resolution and a 15-minute\nperiod for the temporal resolution, so it can be applied to any data that can be expressed in these\nterms.\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\nPrototype service implemented\non NGANet. Not yet ported to\nNSANet.\n\nSource Data\n- Geohashes of GPS point event\ndata.\n\nCaveats\n- Requires event locations and\ntimes for every selector.\n- Designed for 1 km grid-based\nlocations and 15 minute time\nintervals.\n- Co-travel capability would\nrequire analyst to define a series\nof meetings at specified\nlocations.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n7\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The purpose of this service is to determine whether two entities could have\nbeen co-located given observed event locations for those entities. To detect co-travel, the analyst would\nneed to define a series of meeting locations and times. The opportunity volume analytic could also\nprovide a mechanism for vetting co-travel analytics by testing for possible co-location events along cotravel routes.\n\nTMI Co-Traveler Analytic\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The\nTrack Mutual Information (TMI) cloud analytic\nwas developed as a study under their graph analytics, alerting, and target development program. The\nanalytic is oriented to work on 7 to 30 days worth of regional collection. It has been tested on RT-RG\ndata from the\nregion. Instead of using GCID information as co-travel reference points, the\nanalytic works cross-network by computing target \u201ccloseness\u201d based on the GCID Lat/Long GEO\ninformation and time. The Lat/Long information is obtained from RT-RG.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic starts by computing event sequences of LAT, LONG, and time for\neach selector. These are called \u201ctracks\u201d. It then computes a value that measures how far the selector\nhas traveled in general. If the selector has not traveled outside a 20 to 50 km radius, the selector is not\nconsidered. Each eligible selector\u2019s tracks are pairwise-compared to the others and a measure of\nsimilarity in time and space is computed.\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\nInitial development completed.\nIn testing phase, not yet\noperational\n\nSource Data\n- Sortinglead summaries of\nFASCIA data on GM-PLACE and\nGM- RT-RG regional GSM collection\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic only considers tasked\nselectors as seeds.\n- Analytic does not consider\ntargets that do not travel outside\na 20 to 50 km radius.\n- Track dataset must be\nrepopulated for each data\nupdate\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) would like to reduce processing by creating an index containing selectors\nwhose tracks are near each other in space. To achieve this, future work may make use of a GEOAddress\nhashing algorithm that uses LAT/LONG information to group cell towers into clusters that are in the\nsame region. This hash considers latitude and longitude only, and is agnostic to the targets\u2019 service\nprovider. It may be possible to also compare target tracks quickly by comparing these GeoAddresses.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n8\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nCo-Traveler Analytics\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY)\nhas developed two co-travel analytics: Fast Follower (FF) and\nMeet&Greet Spatial Chaining (MGSC). The FF analytic was initially designed to detect individuals who\nare following station personnel. Detailed non-SIGINT path data is collected consensually on the station\npersonnel, and this reference path data provides the seeds for this analytic, which attempts to discover\nmobile GEO data indicating individuals that may be following the station personnel. The MGSC analytic\nis designed to detect meetings between high-value individuals and other entities.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The FF analytic begins by considering non-SIGINT reference paths for station\npersonnel based on detailed knowledge of the entity\u2019s location. Candidate followers are determined by\nidentifying other individuals that have traversed some number of consecutive points (determined by the\nanalyst) that match the reference path in space and time. The analyst also sets a parameter to specify\nthe minimum distance that must be covered along a candidate path.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The MGSC analytic is designed for ELKPRINTS data from smartphones. This\nanalytic identifies sequences of consecutive location points close in time and combines them into a\nsingle data point. A maximum velocity movement parameter is applied to create a time window around\neach point representing the approximate time at which the individual was located there (as opposed to\ntraveling to or from that location). Finally, co-travelers are identified by discovering pairs of selectors\nthat meet the duration and distance thresholds set by the analyst as input parameters. Spatial chaining\nsoftware aggregates and presents the meeting data, including the locations, times, and scoring metrics\nto the analyst.\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\nThe MGSC analytics has been\ntested on real ELKPRINTS data,\nbut results have not been\nvalidated by operational\nanalysts.\nThe FF analytic has been tested\non made-up data.\n\nSource Data\n- Smartphone data from\nELKPRINTS\n- Reference-path data (FF)\n- List of selectors (MGSC)\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic designed for precise\ngeolocation data (e.g., from\nsmartphones)\n- MGSC analytic would require\nthe analyst to define a series of\nmeetings\n\nPACT NGA-NSA GATC Analytic\n\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The PACT analytic is a joint NSA-NGA effort to identify co-traveling Thuraya\nhandsets. The effort was motivated by an increase in Thuraya phone usage by\n. SIGINT Geospatial Analysts were able to characterize the travel\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n9\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nbehaviors of the targeted Thuraya handsets and identifying other handsets with similar patterns. The\ntargeted handsets were observed traveling between known\ngovernment and military\ninstallations; therefore, handsets with similar travel behaviors were inferred to be\ngovernment\nforces.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The first step of PACT is to identify a set of waypoints for each target handset.\nWaypoints are generated from sequences of events that cluster together in space and time. The second\nstep is to identify which pairs of handsets contain similar waypoint clusters. Pairs are scored based on\nthe number of waypoint clusters that match. This analytic also considers the total possible number of\nwaypoint clusters for each selector, so that the total number of communication events per selector is\ntaken into consideration. This process is intended to reduce the possibility of producing results that\ninclude incidental co-travel. The third step in this analytic identifies persistent patterns by examining the\ntime periods over which co-location occurs for each co-travel candidate pair.\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\nTested on VOICESAIL data from\nCULTWEAVE. Patterns stored in\nQFD.\nIn process of transitioning PACT\nto NSA/S2.\n\nSource Data\n- Thuraya data from CULTWEAVE\n(~500 M waypoints in\nCULTWEAVE)\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic designed for Thuraya\nor other point data\n\nFuture Work\nFuture work could involve applying this analytic to other types of QFD datasets such as Inmarsat and\nGSM data. The team is also interested in building on this analytic to enable discovery of asynchronous\nco-traveling relationships.\n\nR6 SORTINGLEAD Co-Traveler Analytic\nBackground\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) R6 has been partnering with Chalkfun to upgrade the Chalkfun co-traveler\nanalytic to a cloud-based analytic that will run on Cloud 14 (to eventually be migrated to MDR-2).\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The R6 co-traveler analytic accepts a selector and timeframe as input, and\nthen derives an itinerary for the selector that includes the CELL IDs and/or VLRs (depending on what is\navailable). The itinerary is based on a series of waypoints generated from the location information that\nis available in FASCIA-PCS. Then, the analytic searches for other selectors that were \u201cnear\u201d these\nwaypoints in space and time. Time windows are configurable and can be adjusted by the user. Each\ncandidate is scored and then prioritized based on the scores.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The R6 co-traveler analytic operates on Sortinglead Event Summaries and a\nGEO Index. The Sortinglead Event Summaries provide rapid access to FASCIA PCS events by summarizing\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n10\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nand enriching key elements of selector behavior. The Sortinglead Event Summaries benefit this analytic\nbecause they can provide enriched location information about selectors that is not present in the raw\nmetadata. The GEO Index contains a mapping between the locations (GCIDs or VLRs) visited by a\nselector and the time (day/minute) that the visit(s) occurred. Information from command and control\nnetworks that track IED attacks is also used to enrich the GEO Index.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The results that can be returned from this type of analytic can potentially be\nenormous. Each candidate will have some level of time and space overlap with the seed. Prioritization\noccurs by assessing the quality of the overlap in terms of time and space closeness. The analyst may\nchoose to triage any number of potential candidates (e.g. top 10 or top 100 candidates, or candidates\nthat surpass a given threshold).\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n- In testing phase to be\nreplacement back-end for the\ncurrent production CHALKFUN\nco-traveler tool\n- Cloud-based (MapReduce)\nimplementation under\ndevelopment to handle larger\nnumbers of queries\nsimultaneously\n\nSource Data\n- FASCIA PCS Sortinglead\nSummaries\n- CHALKFUN enrichment (VLR\ncountry mapping)\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic cannot recover crossnetwork co-travelers\n- Analytic will not be effective\nagainst stationary (non-traveling)\ntargets\n- Processing is memory intensive\n- Analytic is sensitive to large\ncells, VLRs, and dense areas\n- Not directly applicable to sat\nphones with LAT/LONG\ninformation\n- Results can be very sensitive to\ntimeframe chosen as input. For\ninstance, analytic will not be\neffective for large queries across\nmultiple countries and large time\nframes (e.g., anywhere in\nover the past year and then\nanywhere in\n).\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Because the R6 co-traveler analytic depends on GCID and VLR locations as\nmeeting points or waypoints, it will not return selectors that co-travel on different provider networks.\n(For instance, it could not return a Verizon selector co-traveling with a T-Mobile selector.) The R6 team\nis working on experiments that might \"alias\" seed selectors to nearby selectors on other networks to get\naround this problem, but this poses challenges. The RT-RG analytic (discussed later in this paper) uses\nrelative velocities to deal with the cross-network challenge, but this approach requires pre-computing\ntravel behavior for all pairs of selectors, which can be computationally expensive.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n11\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nRT-RG Sidekicks\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The RT-RG Sidekick Cloud-Based Co-traveler analytic compares average travel\nvelocity between pairs of selectors to infer whether or not could co-travel would practically be possible.\nThe velocity factor is intended to reduce the number of false positives when considering travel among\nurban areas by filtering out pairs of selectors that were seen at the same series of CELL IDs or VLRs over\ntime, but could not have been traveling together because the location data timestamps presuppose an\nunreasonable velocity. This may happen because one or both of the selectors in the pair may have been\nlocated at the edges of the network coverage during one or more of their travel midpoints.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic first computes \u201cmovement summaries\u201d of all available tasked\nselectors. The movement summaries contain a list of locations that a target visited during the timeframe\nof interest, given by the analyst. Locations are defined by CELL IDs (for GSM) or GEO-Hashes (for\nany other selectors with Lat/Long). Then, the system discovers pairs of targets that could be traveling\ntogether by comparing their sequences of physical locations and factoring out pairs that could not have\nreasonably arrived at the meeting waypoints within 10 minutes of each other.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) One of the main benefits of the RT-RG Sidekicks analytic is that it is not\nconstrained by provider network. Because it considers physical (LAT/LONG) locations and travel\nvelocities, it can provide co-traveler results that include selectors on different provider networks.\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n- QFD available at RT-RG analyst\ndesktop.\nRT-RG Tools: Goldminer, CHET,\nGEOT\n\nSource Data\n- Sortinglead Event Summaries\n(the\nsubset\nof Fascia PCS)\n- Currently running on RT-RG\n- Could possibly scale to FASCIA\nevent summaries\n\nCaveats\n- Requires accurate tower geo\ndata (location and date)\n- Requires pre-computing all\nselectors against all selectors,\nwhich can be expensive\n- Current output includes only\ntasked selectors\n- Analytic is not designed for\nstationary targets.\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Currently, the system is integrated with RT-RG, operating on\nGSM data. It may scale to a larger data source; however, it is designed to precompute sidekicks for each\npossible pair or tasked selectors.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic could also be applied to DNI location data.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n12\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nScalable Analytics Tradecraft Center (SATC) Geospatial Lifelines CoTravel QFD\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines QFD applies the concept of \u201cdwell times\u201d to identify\nDNR co-travelers. Dwell times describe the time period spent at the beginning or ending destination. A\nlocation is considered a beginning or ending location if the dwell time at that location is greater than 2\nhours.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This QFD first generates geohashes using GSM event data, and then\ncalculates transition lines indicating that a device traveled from one geohash to another. The result is a\ngraph in which the geohashes represent nodes and the transitions represent links or edges. Clustering\nalgorithms are applied to the graphs to determine locations and selectors of interest.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines represent the beginning and ending locations, as\ndefined by their dwell times, and all other intermediate observations. The likeliness of co-travel along\npaths between starting and destination points is based on the following measurements: net distance,\ntime of transition (mins), speed (kph), Azimuth, and number of travel segments.\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\nAnalytic tested on 90 days of\nGSM event data from\n\nSource Data\n- Geohashes of GSM event data\nretrieved from FASCIA.\n\nCode is available through SATC,\nbut analytic is no longer under\ndevelopment.\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic designed for GSM\ndata, but could be applied to\nother types of data\n- Oriented to targets that remain\nin one location for at least 2\nhours\n- Requires Geocoded source data\nfor generating Geohashes\n\nFuture Work\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The code for this QFD is available through SATC, but the analytic is no longer\nunder development.

The first mode accepts a list\nof tasked targets via UTT, and attempts to identify co-travelers for those targets that have been deemed\nto have travelled during a specified time window (typically 30 days). The analytic only considers targets\nthat traveled between at least 2 countries in a given month. For these traveling targets, candidate cotravelers are scored based on how many times they were seen in the same locations during the same\ntimes as the target. Target locations are given by DNI selector IP geolocation, provided by ASDF enriched\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nwith GEO reference data (or geo-tagging where available). Because this data provides city-level location\nresolution, co-traveler candidates are assigned scores based on the extent to which they were seen in\nthe same cities and on the same days as targets.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The second mode accepts a pattern representing target travel across\nspanning countries of interest (e.g.,\n), and optionally, the days on which the countries\nwere visited. In this mode, the TAC/Caf\u00e9/TMAC DNI Co-travel analytic in this mode identifies travelers\nthat (at minimum) match the pattern.

Many of the analytics define themselves by (1) the key issues they address in novel ways and\n(2) the types of source data on which they operate.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The key issues section highlights capabilities that might improve the accuracy\nof the analytic results. For example, analytics that have knowledge about the locations of GCIDs and\nVLRs and can augment their procedures with non-SIGINT data such as geographic and terrestrial data.\nThis information contains knowledge about the locations of highways and roads. Analytics that can\ngeographically validate routes between meeting points can then use this information to constrain the\npossible co-travel routes and candidate co-travel selectors along those routes.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Analytics that can operate on a variety of different source data formats,\nincluding both DNI and DNR, benefit from the ability to exploit divergent data sources to develop more\ncomplete pictures of target travel behavior.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The co-travel analytics in this study are at various stages of development,\ntesting, and deployment. One possible way forward could be to have an independent organization2\nperform a formal evaluation of these analytics using a common test dataset. This would enable a fair\ncomparison and assessment of the analytics\u2019 processing time, efficiency, and accuracy. Understanding\nthe advantages and challenges of each analytic against a common test dataset with ground truth may\nfacilitate planning for future work.\n\n2\n\nAn independent organization is one that is not involved in the development of any of these analytics and that\ndoes not have a stake in the outcome.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n17\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nAcknowledgments\n(U//FOUO) Thanks to all of the participants in this study, listed as POCs under the individual analytics.\nThese individuals participated in face-to-face meetings and phone interviews, and provided the details\nof their analytics to this study through briefings and write-ups.

Not for Public Distribution\nPage 3\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFORWARD\nVideo games are a media platform that has become part of daily activity for many\naround the world. Whether it is casual gaming on a cell phone or PC, or a virtual world\nwhere individuals are connected via the Internet, interaction in and around games is\nincreasing. Games entertain, encourage interaction, enable financial gain, and teach\nlessons. While many of these activities are meant to be harmless, they also have the\npotential to be exploited for malicious activities.\nOver the course of a year, extensive study was done on the common use of games and\ntheir applicability to terrorist activities. Academic journals and papers, newspaper and\nmagazine articles, textbooks, non-fiction works, in-game exploration and personal\ninterviews on games, psychology and sociology, as well as attendance at seminars on\nthese issues (for example the Serious Games conference or SAIC\u2019s Cyber-Influence\nConference series) represent the main sources for this report.\nThe report was written in five stand-alone papers that are compiled here as a\ncomprehensive primer for the current and potential future of game usage. A majority of\nthe information contained in this report identifies facts and trends and applies them to the\nrealm of IC concern (Chapters 1, 2, and 4). In addition, the paper contains examples of\nfictitious scenarios that terrorists or extremists might employ (Chapter 3), technology\nadvancements and trends that might enable those scenarios (Chapter 4), and recommend\nsteps to ensure that those hypotheses are not realized (Chapter 5).\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 4\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 5\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nGaming Markets: Why We Care\nDemographics\nThe gaming population crosses age, gender and cultural boundaries, making\ninroads into previously untapped markets and providing terrorist organizations with a\npowerful platform to reach core target audiences.\n\u2022\n\nThe core demographic for gaming is 18 \u2013 35 year-old males. However, the\naverage age of the typical \u201cgamer\u201d increases by one year each year and women\nnow comprise nearly one-third of all adult gamers.i\n\n\u2022\n\nThe online gaming population is expected to grow rapidly in the near term,\nresulting in an estimated 10 million online game players in the U.S. (i.e. the\nequivalent of the entire population of New York City) and 30 million online game\nplayers worldwide (i.e. the equivalent of the entire population of Shanghai,\nBombay and Karachi combined).ii\n\n\u2022\n\nWhile the majority of online gamers originate from U.S. and Asian markets, the\nrapid expansion of Internet cafes and broadband technologies will enable the\ngrowth of online gaming populations in other regions. For example, the fastest\ngrowing gaming markets are occurring in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.iii\n\n\u2022\n\nGaming sales continue to increase by a compound annual rate of 19.1%. Sales\nsurpassed 23 billion USD in 2003 and are estimated to reach 56 billion USD by\n2008. In turn, revenues reached approximately $6 billion in 2004 and are\nprojected to reach $14.3 billion by 2009.iv\n\nPopularity\nGaming has emerged as the preeminent form of entertainment among 18 \u2013 35 yearold males. Consequently, the gaming industry now rivals traditional entertainment\nindustries, including the film and music industries in terms of growth, revenue, and\nconsumption.v\n\u2022\n\nFor example, the gaming industry is growing by 20% compared to 7.5%, 7.1%\nand 2% growth rates in the film, television, and music industries during the same\nperiod. Furthermore, AC Nielson predicts that within four years, the film industry\nwill be just one-third the size of the computer game market.vi\n\n\u2022\n\nGame users typically spend 20-30 hours per week on online games and more than\n20% of online gamers identify themselves as residents of virtual worlds.vii\n\n\u2022\n\nThe stereotype of the lonely gamer spending long hours in social isolation is no\nlonger tenable. While some games are played by singular or a group of isolated\nplayers, computer gaming now is increasingly social with the growth of Local\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 6\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nArea Network (LAN) games played in Internet cafes and the expansion of\nmassively online multiplayer games (MMOG). Users are now interacting with\nothers in the game (i.e. guilds), online in other cyber media (i.e. web sites,\nmessage boards and social networking sites) and in cybercaf\u00e9s providing a fertile\nground for terrorist activities.\n\u2022\n\nIt is widely thought that online gaming may have a similar cultural, political, and social\ninfluence on today\u2019s gamers that music, religion and politics had on earlier generations.viii\n\nGlobal Patterns in Game Play: Time Spent, Social Interaction and Reach\nGames consume a great deal of time and effort by a significant number of players around the world. In a\nstudy done by Nick Yee at Stanford University on Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games\n(MMORPG) users, 50% of the 30,000 respondents worked full time, with only 22% as full-time students.\nThe average age of the respondents was 26.5, (women tended to be older than me) and on average the\nrespondents spent 22.71 hours per week in their chosen MMORPG, a time involvement which suggests\nthat there is a substantial level of emotional investment in the MMORPG environment.\n\nGlobal Market\n\nCounter-Strike is considered the most popular online first-person shooter\n(FPS) game in the world with the more than 200,000 players playing\nsimultaneously and contributing more than 5.5 billion minutes of playing\ntime each month on the official network consisting of more than 100,000\nservers.* Counter-Strike is played extensively throughout Central,\nSoutheast, and Southwest Asia in addition to the core U.S., European and\nAsian markets.*\n\nPalestinian\nMarket\n\nReportedly, more than 25% of children between the ages of 6 and 17 in the\nPalestinian territories access the Internet through Internet centers that have\nemerged in refugee camps, rural villages, and urban areas. Palestinian\nInternet center managers and computer lab owners have reported that most\nchildren spend most of their time playing online games, including \u201cproArab\u201d games like Special Force and Under Siege.\n\nSouthwest &\nSoutheast\nAsian Markets\n\nKuma Games produces and distributes episodic games depicting real life\nmilitary operations. These games are played throughout Southeast and\nSouthwest Asia. During the height of media coverage on Middle East\nnetworks like Al-Jazeera, 20% of Kuma\u2019s total audience originated from\nthe Middle East region with significant amounts of game traffic coming\nfrom Egypt and a notable number of players originating from Iran and Iraq.\n[See: End Note xxvii]\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 7\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFunctionality of Online Games\nGames are platforms on which participants may communicate, coordinate,\nsocialize, train, learn, simulate, experiment, build, proselytize and even barter virtual\ngoods. Such functions indicate that the line between the \u2018virtual\u2019 world and the \u2018real\u2019\nworld is blurring, and to some users may be non-existent.\n\u2022\n\nThat virtual worlds are becoming synonymous with the real world, provides and\ninteresting opportunity for terrorists to conduct a range of activities with\nanonymity.\n\nAs virtual worlds become more popular, pervasive, and sophisticated, so too will\nterrorist opportunities to exploit them.\n\u2022\n\nFor example, as gaming becomes increasingly popular across multiple\ndemographics and access to various gaming platforms increases (i.e. access to\npersonal computers, Internet cafes, and mobile platforms), it will become easier\nfor terrorist groups to reach core target audiences. For these reasons, many expect\nthat terrorist groups will increasingly leverage online and computer based games\nto support their activities in the future.\n\nPropaganda and Influence\nTerrorist groups and sympathizers could use games to twist historical context,\ndemonize enemies, disrupt the social moral compass, and desensitize users to\nviolence.ix\n\u2022\n\nGames designed to appeal to terrorist sympathizers leverage salient political\nthemes and typically exploit \u201cpro-Arab\u201d and \u201canti-Israel\u201d sentiment. Such games\nattract players because they provide them with a consonant message and an\nopportunity to take part \u2018virtually\u2019 in \u201cresistance movements.\u201dx\n\n\u2022\n\nSpecial Force, developed by Hezbollah, plays on the common themes of \u201cIsraeli\noccupation\u201d and \u201cPalestinian victimization,\u201d and offers players the opportunity to\n\u2018fight back\u2019 by \u2018digitally\u2019 reenacting various elements of the Intifada. For\ninstance, the introductory level of Special Force involves target practice and\nshooting exercises, using images of Israeli Generals as the mark. Later levels\ninvolve the \u2018digital\u2019 reenactment of battles that have occurred between the IDF\nand Palestinians during the Israeli occupation.xi\n\n\u2022\n\nSpecial Force was intentionally designed by Hezbollah to reinforce and\ndisseminate the group\u2019s values, concepts, and ideas among supporters and\nsympathizers, while giving passive supporters the opportunity to experience the\nviscera of the front lines.xii Special Force is available in Arabic, French, English,\nand Farsi, and thus is widely available to traditional Hezbollah audiences and\nothers.xiii\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 8\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n\u2022\n\nUnder Ash and its sequel Under Siege were published by the Syrian company Dar\nal-Fikr. The player takes the role of a Palestinian national opposing the occupiers\nfrom Israel. Under Siege, in particular, is based on actual events, but is presented\nfrom the Syrian perspective. The game employs visceral imagery and sound,\nincluding scenes of Palestinian children being murdered, summary executions\nbeing held in public streets, high-speed chase scenes and sounds of gunfire and\nheart pumping music. The scenes too are designed to evoke outrage and to play\non common themes, including \u201cIsraeli occupation,\u201d \u201cInjustice,\u201d and \u201cRevenge\u201d.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Iranian Islamic Students Association has also developed an online game,\nCommander Bahman, in which users play the role of a special-forces unit tasked\nwith protecting Iranian nuclear capabilities from American aggression. This\ngame was developed in direct response to a Kuma Reality Games release, Assault\non Iran. Kuma has subsequently developed another installment, Assault on Iran,\nPt.3, in the hopes that this international dialogue, sparked by the depiction of\nglobal affairs in the game space, will continue. Assault on Iran, Pt. 3 is planned\nbe released in Arabic, English, and Farsi.xiv\n\nVideo games make particular assumptions within their environment that can\ntranscend a specific message to users.\n\u2022\n\nFor example, the games Ummah Defense and Ummah Defense II (free for\ndownload on the Internet), are set in the future, based on the premise that at some\npoint in history Muslims will have conquered the world and killed or converted\nall non-Muslims. Users act as a member of the Intergalactic Muslim Council,\nworking to protect Earth from the sole disbeliever and in his army of robots sent\nto destroy the Earth \u2013 it was necessary to construct robots as all other humans\nbelieve in Islam. The overarching message is that establishment of the caliphate\nis possible.xv Playing games within this context allows users to experience this\nreality in a sensory way that makes the message \u201creal.\u201d\n\nVideo games are an ideal influence platform because they incorporate imagery,\nnarrative, camaraderie, and action.\n\u2022\n\nThis combination works because advanced imagery and graphics can be used to\nengage the senses, storylines can be used to provide a context and group goals,\ncamaraderie in the form of multiple players facilitates higher levels of\nengagement, and action in the form of participation is required.xvi\n\nRadical groups are using gaming platforms to propagate religious ideology. This\ncan take place in a number of different ways. For example, a FPS game can help\ndemonize a declared enemy, while educational games can offer manipulated religious\ndoctrine as scripture.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 9\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n\u2022\n\nFor example, Innovative Minds, Inc. has developed a series of six \u2018multi-level\u2019\ndownloadable games, entitled \u201cIslamic Fun\u201d which are aimed at \u201cteaching\nchildren between the ages of 5 and 11 years of age about Islam.\u201d \u201cIslamic Fun\u201d is\nmarketed as a \u201cfaith-based\u201d alternative to \u201csecular\u201d games and includes many age\nappropriate game titles, including Fishing Bear, Tree Hop, and Two Bunny Race.\nHowever, embedded in this game package is another game, entitled The\nResistance, in which users assume the role of farmers in Southern Lebanon who\njoin the Islamic Resistance against invading Israelis.xvii Many believe that these\ntypes of games encourage anti-Semitism and promote terrorism.xviii\n\nCommunications\nGames provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups and sympathizers\nbecause in-game conversations often are difficult or impossible to monitor.\n\u2022\n\nMany games contain capabilities like VoIP, chat, and file transfers that allow real-time\ncommunications to take place, and few sites monitor such traffics or keep log files as\nwould traditional Internet service providers (ISPs).\n\n\u2022\n\nMassively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) are ideal locations to support secure\nterrorist communications because of the enormous scale on which they are played. At a\ngiven time thousands of subscribers can be connected to a virtual world on various game\nservers. Potentially complicating matters are that some games can be hosted by gamers\non their own dedicated server or PC.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn-game communication channels would be difficult to collect by current Internet\ncontrol methods, because speech and text mingles with data from the game. This\nincreases the chances that authorities will overlook communications they would\nnormally prohibit.\n\nRecruitment\nOnline gaming can serve as a recruiting tool. This has already proven true in the\nUS, as the US Army found that 28% of players logging on to play its, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Army\u201d\nonline game also visited the corresponding recruitment site.\n\u2022\n\nMonitoring strategy games like Counterstrike can be an effective way to track\nindividual skill levels in firearms, tactical operations, group cohesion, leadership,\netc. This information can then be used by interested parties to evaluate\nqualifications for military or insurgent recruitment.\n\n\u2022\n\nParticipation in virtual communities can facilitate off-line activity. Members of\nterrorist groups could enter or monitor online game environments with the intent\nof translating \u2018virtual\u2019 skills and actions into real world commitments and\nactivities.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 10\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nTraining and Simulation\nGames can supplement field training by familiarizing recruits with the tactics,\nweaponry, and skills needed to conduct operations. Military type games can be used to\nhelp acquire skills in team work, communications, leadership, and operational tactics.\nThis trend is likely to manifest itself in the near future, as games are increasingly\nleveraging real time data from the battle field.\n\u2022\n\nCulturally accurate games can help foreign terrorists avoid profile raising\nmistakes and assist in assimilation.\n\n\u2022\n\nCombat simulators, such as those developed by BBN Technologies as part of the\nPentagon\u2019s DARWARS project, are used to help soldiers bound for Iraq prepare\nfor combat. Among the offerings: DARWARS Ambush! a combat simulation\ngame designed to train up to 24 soldiers at a time in military convoy operations.xix\n\n\u2022\n\nIncreasingly realistic virtual environments further blur the lines between the\nvirtual and real worlds \u2013 these environments create immersive environments that\ndraw users into the game world. This results in more true-to-life training grounds,\nand enhances a game\u2019s underlying message as the user experience becomes more\nimmersive.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe US military is currently using games as a tool to equip personnel with\ntraining in numerous key areas including, tactical planning, mission rehearsal,\nincorporating lessons learned, and tactical language training. xx\n\n\u2022\n\nCOTS programs used to develop combat simulators are inexpensive, widely\navailable, and could offer terrorist groups the opportunity to simulate attacks prior\nto their execution. Such programs could enable fairly accurate damage\nassessments and provide insight into necessary course correction to limit risk and\nunintended consequences associated with a particular attack. For example, the\nMaya Unlimited fluid simulation software, available for $159, offers users the\nability to re-create the mushroom cloud caused by a nuclear explosion. Users can\ncontrol the influence of fuel and other attributes, and add key ingredients such as\ntemperature scale, buoyancy, dissipation, turbulence, and diffusion.\n\n\u2022\n\nGames could also be used as part of the attack plan itself. With the rise of mobile\ngaming, terrorist groups can use the platform to its advantage; instead of planting\na bomb near a crowd of people, for example, it can place one at a random location\nand lead game players to the bomb.*\n\n*\n\nThis is speculative based on flash mobs and mobile gaming use. Flash mobs are groups of people that\nconverge in public places for brief periods of time and dissipate quickly there after. Flash mobs have\noccurred worldwide and are frequently organized around political protest efforts. The French riots of 2005\nwere organized largely through flash mob efforts. Paired with mobile scavenger hunting location based or\nmixed reality games, flash mobs have the potential to concentrate people rapidly at the site of the \u201cwin.\u201d\nSee stories on flash mobs: http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3056735,00.html;\nhttp://in.rediff.com/netguide/2003/oct/05flash.htm. Some examples of location based games include:\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 11\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFundraising\nNewer games offer greater opportunities for terror groups to raise and distribute\nfunds. Funds used in online games can be uploaded in one location and downloaded in\nanother, which is particularly easy if multiple users can access a single ID.\n\u2022\n\nThe goods, services, and currencies of virtual worlds have real-world impact. In\n2005, E-bay category 1654, \u201cInternet Games,\u201d had $30 million dollars in sales in\nthe United States. Similarly in Asia, real-cash virtual item trade exceeds $100\nmillion annually.xxi Current estimates indicate that intangible goods in digital\nworlds are worth $1-$2 billion.xxii\n\n\u2022\n\nBecause users are able to create their own content in games, entrepreneurs profit\nin real-world dollars by selling professional services or goods. One virtual real\nestate mogul in Second Life makes nearly $150,000 per year in real-world dollars.\n\n\u2022\n\nFund raising efforts are already happening in virtual worlds. In 2006, American\nCancer Society (ACS) held its second virtual Relay for Life in Second Life. ACS\ncollected over $40,000 and attracted nearly 1,000 participants.xxiii\n\n\u2022\n\nIndividuals organize to raise funds for charitable efforts. After Hurricane Katrina,\nsome individuals banded together to hold live fundraising events in Second Life to\nhelp victims.xxiv\n\n\u2022\n\nOrganizations could use virtual worlds as a vehicle for generating income. While\nthe money raised might not be enough to fund a sizable organization, it could be a\nrevenue source for smaller cells.\n\nEase of Production of Games\nThe growing availability of middleware or mods drastically lowers the barriers of\nentry for game development, allowing almost anyone to become a game builder.\nMiddleware products are available for a marginal fee (usually the cost of a game) or\ncan be downloaded free from the Internet.\n\u2022\n\nMods are typically used to create additional content to games (partial\nconversions) or new games (total conversions). Popular middleware products\ninclude 3D world building packages such as Genesis 3D, Quake, Unreal, and\nHalf-Life; multiplayer adventure games like Aurora Toolkit; and systems for\nhandling massively multiplayer games like BigWorld, Butterfly.net, and\nTerazona.\n\nBotfighter series, Gunslinger series, Mogi, UnderCover series, Swordfish and Torpedo Bay, ConQwest,\nThe Journey II, and Treasure Hunt.

For example, unidentified gamers\nmodified the FPS game Battlefield 2 enabling players to take on the role of\nextremists whose home village in Iraq suffered collateral damage during a\nfictional US operation.xxv\n\n\u2022\n\nAnother prime example of the use of mods is the CD-ROM game Ethnic\nCleansing, produced by Resistance Records, to promote the white supremacy\nagenda. The game promotes the killing of \u201csub-humans\u201d (other races and Jews)\nin a setting similar to New York City. The game is patterned after popular\nmainstream video games Quake and Doom, turning racially motivated violence\ninto a form of \u201centertainment.\u201d Users are given the option of assuming the role of\na KKK Member or a Skinhead.\n\n\u2022\n\nKuma Games develops free, episodic games for their users based on recent real\nworld events. With the assistance of the Valve\u2019s Source game engine,xxvi modular\nsoftware that provides enhancements in several key areas of game production,\nincluding character animation, advanced AI and real-world physics, Kuma is\neasily able to produce immersive, realistic games in little time. Additionally, in\nan effort to make the games more easily downloaded by users in the Middle East,\nKuma has developed a Persia Disk that can easily be copied and redistributed.\nUsing the disk, once the game design is loaded onto the user\u2019s PC, no Internet\nconnection is required to play, although a low-band connection is adequate to\nattain new episodes.xxvii\n\n\u2022\n\nTerrorist groups likely could reduce development costs further by soliciting\nsympathizers with the required skill sets to work for free or reduce costs as their\ncontribution to the Jihad analogous to how religious game developers operate to\nreduce costs.xxviii College students provide a plausible target for recruitment.\n\nMachinima is film making within the real-time 3D virtual environment of a video\ngame. It\u2019s the use of video game graphics technology to create animated films.\nMachinima combines aspects of film making, animation and game design to transform an\ninteractive medium, a video game, into a production studio complete with sets, props,\nspecial effects and virtual actors. All that is required is a game and a desktop computer.\u2020\nLike traditional movies, machinima allows for character development and the creation of\nplot lines.\n\u2020\n\nFor a machinima example that uses military characters and explains machinima, see\nMachinima!

Websites like\nwww.fraps.com provide trial versions of machinima software, such as the one\nused to produce \u201cSonic Jihadxxix,\u201d and allow users to create quality machinima\nproductions. Productions, such as \u201cSonic Jihad,\u201d which are made with trial\nversions of machinima software frequently place their websites directly in the\ncenter of the screen in order to drive people to their sites to purchase full versions.\nProductions like \u201cSonic Jihad\u201d not only can promote propaganda, but direct\nsympathizers who wish to create similar productions to the software needed.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn 2005, a machinima, \u201cFrench Democracy\u201d depicted the views of the minorities\nduring the French riots. The well-developed story carries a political message\nallowing one to sympathize with the minority position in the riots. The\nmachinima was produced on November 22, just 5 days after the riots ended.\n\n\u2022\n\nSimilar to using mods to develop games, real-time video capture software, like\nFraps, allows users to record video of the activity taking place on one\u2019s PC,\nduring game play, for example. Once downloaded, this software \u201crecords\u201d to\ncapture audio and video bits up to 1152x864 and 100 frames per second.xxx The\nuse of such software in games like Kuma/Wars would allow users to develop\nmachinima productions of recent combat events adding their own twist.\nFeatures of Fraps Real-time Video Capture Software\nScreen capturing \u2013 Digital images taken by the software recording the visible\nitems on the monitor as a screenshot in formats such as BMP, PNG and JPG.\nReal-time video capturing \u2013 Digital images taken by the software recording the\nvisible items on the monitor (or another visual output device) over an extended\nperiod of time, as the action is taking place, to form a video file.\nScreencast/Screen Recording \u2013 Digital recording of a computer screen output,\noften containing audio narration.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 14\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 15\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nChapter Introduction\nGames are an effective influence platform because they promote both \u201cactive\u201d and\n\u201cpassive\u201d learning, and are highly attractive pursuits for specific target audiences.\nGames, by nature, are learning experiences. Playing a game involves building skills\nin order to advance to new levels in the game.\n\u2022\n\nTraditional teaching and conditioning methods are used to teach and develop the\nplayer.\n\n\u2022\n\nLearning is central to a player\u2019s in-game success.xxxi\n\nLearning in games can be transparent (e.g. helping to refine a player\u2019s shooting\ntechnique) or hidden (developing a predisposition in a player toward a particular cause or\nmessage).\n\u2022\n\nThe latter often involves the promotion within the game of a particular set of\nvalues or ideologies via the storyline or setting, and the use of emotional \u201ctools\u201d\nto elicit particular reactions.\n\nFinally, games can be effective influence platforms because they are popular,\ncaptivating players and encouraging them to return for more.\nVideo games are \u201cweaponized\u201d texts, or disrupters of psychic stability\u2026I mean to say\nthat games perform what Pierre Bourdieu calls \u201csymbolic violence\u201d\u2014in other words, that\n\u201cgentle, invisible form of violence, which is never recognized as such.\u201d\u2026 Like\neducational institutions, video games are instances of symbolic violence in the sense that\nthey inflict themselves on players. The world of the video game is nothing more than the\non-screen rendering of programmed instructions and decrees. Players are \u201cschooled\u201d by\nan aggressive bombardment of pixellated images and sounds. Every moment is a direct\nimperative, an attack that demands a response.\n-- Matt Garite,\nThe Ideology of Interactivity (or, Video Games and the Taylorization of Leisure) xxxii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 16\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nActive Learning\nGames can serve as a place to learn, imparting knowledge and teaching skills. The\nstructure of games promotes learning through a rewards system.\n\u2022\n\nOften, games require action without expertise, forcing players to experiment and\nlearn.\n\n\u2022\n\nGames also can reinforce previous learning experiences by allowing players to\ninteract with issues, ideologies, products and events in active and passive ways.\n\nKnowledge and Skills\nGames can serve as a place to learn, imparting knowledge and teaching skills.\n\u2022\n\nDuring prehistoric times, hunting games were used to teach young people how to\nhandle dangerous situations in the wild.\n\n\u2022\n\nToday, games are often more complex, involving dynamic platforms,\nsophisticated storylines, and diverse goals.\n\n\u2022\n\nIndividuals progress through an entire learning cycle when playing a game,\nbeginning with openness to new situations and rules, then taking certain actions\nand reflecting on them, and finally \u201clearning\u201d how to operate successfully in the\ngame (see Figure 1).\n\n\u2022\n\nOften the learning process continues outside the game in such ways as\nconversations with friends, participation on fan websites, reading about the\ngames, and player meet-ups online.xxxiii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 17\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nExhibit 2-1: The Learning Frameworkxxxiv\n\nApplication of the Learning Framework to Games\n\n1. Openness: When an individual plays a game, he is open to its structures, rules and\nmessages.\n2. Action: By nature, games present a problem that a player must address and act on in\norder to advance in the game. Actions must take place within the rules and value\nsystems of the game (in this diagram, the game is represented by the box\n\u201cEnvironment\u201d) in order for the player to participate and move forward in the game.\na. Manifestation: The player\u2019s desired outcome in the game is to succeed and\nmitigate losses.\nb. Influencing the external environment: The player takes action to try to\ninfluence the course of the game.\nc. Coaching: The rules of the game provide guidelines on how to take action and\nwhat is permissible and acceptable.\nd. Instinctive learning: When quick action is required, instincts will play a role in\nhow play is performed. This often includes a mix of: lessons learned from past\nexperiences, a player\u2019s personal values system, and physical and emotional\nreactions. This part of learning is generally subconscious.\ne. Nurturing the individual: Assessments about how well the player is playing\nthe game are made frequently throughout the game.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 18\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nf. Conditioning: The player\u2019s actions result in an outcome, which can be the\ndesired outcome, a different yet positive outcome, or a negative outcome.\n3. Reflection: In the wake of the outcome, a player consciously or subconsciously\nmakes an assessment about what worked, what didn\u2019t work, what could be\nimproved, and how to take action differently in the future.\n4. Unlearning to Openness: Reflection enables the \u201cunlearning\u201d of decisions and\nactions taken in the previous game and creates openness to trying again to\nsucceed. This completes one learning cycle and starts another.\nThe structure of games promotes learning through a rewards system.\n\u2022\n\nVideo and other games teach a \u201ccorrect\u201d course of action by providing immediate\nfeedback on a player\u2019s initial action. As discussed with regard to the learning\ncycle, players then reflect on their initial action in an effort to achieve a better\noutcome the next time they are faced with a similar situation in the game.\nLearning = Action + Feedback + Reflectionxxxv\n\n\u2022\n\nPlayers advance to higher levels in games by learning appropriate responses\nduring earlier stages of the game. Games have reinforcement and punishment\nmechanisms such as gaining or losing points for desired responses (i.e. operant\nconditioning).xxxvi\n\n\u2022\n\nThe chainsaw model of video games visually represents the accumulation of\nknowledge and/or skills that leads to advancement to a higher level in a game.\nPlayers move through a series of micro-challenges that, when combined, lead to\nadvancement.\n\nExhibit 2-2: The Chainsaw Model of Video Game Story Structurexxxvii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 19\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nGames often require action without expertise, forcing players to experiment and\nlearn.xxxviii Such learning experiences often involve role exploration, project execution,\nand operating within a game producer\u2019s version of facts and history.\n\u2022\n\nRole exploration \u2013 or choosing a virtual persona and acting out this role in the\ngame \u2013 teaches players the challenges and limits of that role.xxxix\n\n\u2022\n\nMulti-player games which require numerous individuals to carry out a mission\nteach players how to become leaders and execute a collaborative project in its\nentirety.\u2021xl\n\n\u2022\n\nImmersion in a game producer\u2019s version of facts or history teaches players how to\noperate in the defined socio-political environment. This can result in player\nempathy toward a particular cause.xli\n\nApplied Teaching Tool\nGames can reinforce previous learning experiences by allowing players to interact\nwith issues, ideologies, products and events in active and passive ways.\n\u2022\n\nStudies have shown that players who interact with messages, products and the like\nhave higher recollection levels of those messages.\n\n\u2022\n\nActive participation elicits emotional responses, helping the message to resonate\nmore strongly with the player.\n\n\u2022\n\nOften used following other types of learning about a specific environment,\nsimulations teach users how to operate in environments via virtual participation in\nthem. Effective simulation experiences result in particular responses when\nplayers are faced with similar situations in the physical world.\n\nSchools, private businesses and governments are investing in simulations,\nadvergames and in-game promotions to reach and teach their respective target\naudiences.xlii\n\u2022\n\nSchools are increasingly using games in their curricula. Students report feeling\nlike learning is not \u201cwork\u201d with games, and spend more time with the subject\nmatter than if they were reading a book about the topic. Some studies indicate\nthat students retain information from games more effectively than from books\nbecause of the \u201cimmersion\u201d factor of games.\n\n\u2022\n\nMany companies believe advergaming is an effective way to market and \u201cbrand\u201d\ntheir product. Advergames target younger, tech-savvy consumers.xliii Yankee\n\n\u2021\n\nFor example, in World of Warcraft players learn how to plan and execute missions. Players meet prior to\na mission to develop a strategy, determine what roles they will play and how they will execute them. Often\nleaders keep statistics on their players. Following the mission, individuals will review the mission\u2019s\nsuccess and player performance.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 20\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nGroup estimates the in-game advertising market will reach $732 million annually\nby 2010.xliv Already, the names or products of multinational companies such as\nCoca-Cola, Pepsi, Panasonic, Viewsonic, Motorola, Castrol, Nokia, McDonalds,\nSprite, LG and HP have appeared in international game titles in an effort to\npromote their brands and products.xlv\n\u2022\n\nGovernments are using games for military training. Games such as Delta Force\n2, Steel Beasts and Falcon 4.0 have been adapted by various armed forces to\nenhance their relevance to military training. Singapore Armed Forces\u2019 Defense\nScience and Technology Agency has been adapting the games Chain of Command\nand Operation Flashpoint to suit its needs. The Singapore School of Combat\nEngineers and School of Armor have modified Operation Flashpoint to their\nspecific missions, including the use of booby traps, wire and mines.xlvi\n\nPassive Messaging and Conditioning\nThe structure of games promotes winning through a set values system. The strong\nemotions that games can elicit deepen these learning experiences.\n\u2022\n\nGames that elicit strong emotions can predispose a player toward a particular\nviewpoint or cause, or provoke specific reactions on the part of the player.\n\nValue Systems\nThe structure of games promotes winning through a set values system.\n\u2022\n\nPlayers often must adopt a specific set of values in order to achieve a \u201cwin\u201d or\npositive outcome in the game. Sometimes, these values form the context of the\ngame.\n\n\u2022\n\nEthnic Cleansing, which was released in 2002 by Resistance Records, is an\nexample of a game in which a particular set of \u201cvalues\u201d form the context of the\ngame and players are rewarded for adhering to this value system. Players choose\nthe role of a Skinhead or KKK member, and \u201ctake out\u201d as many black, Latino and\nJewish avatars as possible. Racial slurs are made throughout the game, which\nalso portrays negative stereotypes.xlvii\n\n\u2022\n\nTeams or \u201cclans\u201d in massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)\nwhich are formed at advanced levels of games to allow players to achieve greater\nstatus, ranking and advancement , adopt their own value systems, rules and\ncultures.xlviii At this level, players can only be successful by adopting the clan\u2019s\nmodus operandi.\n\nEmotions\nThe strong emotions that games can elicit deepen learning experiences. xlix\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 21\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n\u2022\n\nVideo game play is rich in sensory experiences, engaging motor skills and\npromoting visual experiences like artistic characters and a compelling\nenvironment and auditory experiences like music.\n\n\u2022\n\nAdvancements in graphics have made characters and settings look more \u201creal\u201d,\nstrengthening the emotions they induce.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe rewards system of games that ultimately results in a reward or punishment for\nthe player, also can elicit formidable emotions. Rewards and punishments are\ncentral to \u201cstimulus-reinforcement\u201d learning and \u201cstimulus-response\u201d learning.l\n\nGames that elicit strong emotions can predispose a player toward a particular\nviewpoint or cause, or provoke specific reactions on the part of the player.\n\u2022\n\nFor example, the game, Dafur Is Dying, evokes sympathy for the people of\nDarfur. Players assume the role of a refugee from Dafur facing overwhelming\nchallenges and dangers.

Games have already been exploited by terrorist extremists and\nsympathizers. Emerging trends within the game space suggest greater opportunities will\nexist for future exploitation enhancing a range of terrorist operations, from supporting\nstrategic propaganda and influence activities, to more highly instrumental uses such as\ncommunication, fundraising and recruitment.lix Such activities warrant concern given the\nincreasing popularity of gaming which seems to be transcending age, gender and cultural\nboundaries.\nPotential Uses of Games for Terrorist Activities\n\u2022\n\nPropaganda and Influence - Terrorists and sympathizers use games to twist historical\ncontext, demonize enemies, disrupt the social moral compass, and propagate ideology.\n\n\u2022\n\nCommunications - Games provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups\nand sympathizers because in-game conversations often are difficult to monitor.\n\n\u2022\n\nRecruiting - Online gaming can serve as a recruiting tool. For example, the United States\nArmy found that 28% of players logging on to play its America\u2019s Army online game also\nvisited the corresponding recruitment site.\n\n\u2022\n\nSimulation, Practice and Team Management - Games can supplement field training by\nfamiliarizing recruits with the tactics, weaponry, and skills needed to conduct operations\nand planning.\n\n\u2022\n\nMoney Laundering and Fundraising - Funds used in online games can be uploaded in one\nlocation and downloaded in another by using a single avatar to which multiple people have\naccess via ID and password. Alternately, virtual \u201csweat shops\u201d can be organized to\nd\nd\nb\nld\ni il\ni l i\n\nSeveral plausible scenarios exist where terrorist organizations could leverage the\npower of the gaming medium to achieve operational goals with minimal training and\nexpertise. This paper will outline the current capabilities and potential scenarios by game\ngenre demonstrating how a terrorist organization might exploit the game space. The\nextent to which games can be used by terrorist groups to supplement their other activities\ndepends on a variety of factors, to include:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nInternet connectivity of game users\nCost and availability of hardware and/or software required to play game\nLevel and kind of interaction between players that the game allows\nEase of use of game\nDegree of game skills transferability to real-world activity\nDegree of realism in game design (such as graphics and programming sophistication)\nBarriers to game production\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 26\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe effectiveness of carrying out terrorist activities through games varies by genre.\nEach of the scenarios presented offers the most effective use for its respective type of\ngame. The following chart gives an overview of each game genre and its effectiveness\nfor enabling a specific terrorist objective:\n\nExhibit 3-1: Best Uses of Game Genres in Influence Efforts\u00a7\n\nGenre of\nGame\nFirst-person\nShooter\n\nEnable\nCommunication\n\nSimulation\nand\nTraining\n\nMoney\nLaundering/\nFund Raising\n\nPropaganda\nand Influence\n\nTool for\nRecruitment\n\nEducational\nSimulation\nMixed or\nAlternate\nReality\nMMORPGs\nor MUVEs\nStrategy\nGames\n\nIdeal or good use\nCould be used but requires moderate effort and would be only somewhat effective\nCould be used but would not be an effective choice from a cost/benefit standpoint\n\nNote: THE SCENARIOS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER ARE FICTITIOUS. They\nrepresent plausible uses of games for terrorist influence, planning, recruitment and\ntraining purposes.\n\n\u00a7\n\nA qualitative assessment on the effectiveness of different game genres in enabling terrorist operations was\nbased on information gleaned from research, industry conferences, and gaming experts.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 27\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nPossible Terrorist Use of Different Game Genres\nFirst-person Shooter Games\nFirst-person shooter (FPS) games involve the player taking on a first-person character\nrole, giving him a sense of \u201cbeing there.\u201d These games usually pit players against each\nother or the computer to test their strategies and reflexes in a static, arena-like\nenvironment.\n\u2022\n\nSome of the more popular FPS games include Doom, Half-Life, Counterstrike,\nUnreal Tournament, Halo, Night of Bush Capturing and Under Ash.\n\nExhibit 3-2: A view from the FPS game Half-life as the opponent is shot. lx\n\nProducers often sophisticatedly incorporate various weapons in their FPS games. For\nexample, Alliancelxi allows the user to choose an historic or contemporary weapon for use\nin game play. The game accurately portrays the benefits and drawbacks of the chosen\nweapon, as well as the correct velocity and trajectory of the ammunition.\nFirst-person Shooter Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A Sudanese Islamic extremist group develops a FPS game as a\ntool to influence audiences, train forces and raise funds. The game portrays local\nwarlords as corrupt. Players must take up arms to help defend their towns.\n\u2022\n\nThe player must choose the correct weapon to fight the enemy and calculate when\nto reload the weapon, as well as how to move through the town safely and whom\nto trust. If the player shoots a civilian, the civilian will make a commotion and in\nmoments, the player will be shot \u2013 always.\n\n\u2022\n\nAt the end of the game, when the player has either won or lost a round, a message\nreads, \u201cReal heroes are those who take action in everyday life.

MMORPGs are distinguished from Role Playing Games** by their\n\u201cpersistence\u201d, i.e. the virtual world continues to exist and evolve even when the player is\nnot playing the game.\n\u2022\n\nLeading titles include EverQuest, Star Wars Galaxies, World of Warcraft,\nLineage, Mu, and The Legend of Mir.\n\nGuild In-game\n\nTeam at Worklxii\n\n\u201c\u2026A guild is a collection of players who come together to share knowledge, resources,\nand manpower. To run a large one, a guild master must be adept at many skills:\nattracting, evaluating, and recruiting new members; creating apprenticeship programs;\norchestrating group strategy; and adjudicating disputes. Guilds routinely splinter over\npetty squabbles and other basic failures of management; the master must resolve them\nwithout losing valuable members, who can easily quit and join a rival guild. Never mind\nthe virtual surroundings; these conditions provide real-world training a manager can\napply directly in the workplace\u2026\u201d\n--Taken from:\nYou Play World of Warcraft? You\u2019re Hired!\nby John Seeley Brown and Douglas Thomas\nWired Magazine\n\nWhile MMORPGs involve undertaking missions that are eventually \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost,\u201d\nvirtual worlds focus on daily activities and social interactions.\n\u2022\n\nVirtual world environments allow users to communicate and participate in\nactivities simultaneously with other users regardless of the physical distance\nbetween them.\n\n\u2022\n\nTypically producers establish a virtual world and allow users to develop space and\ndesign items within the world.\n\n**\n\nRPGs require players to undertake a role and play out a narrative in simulated 'worlds' with preprogrammed characters and quests. Players can customize their characters and then interact with other\nplayers to complete goals or quests. RPGs have been produced using both first-person and third-person\nperspectives. Some popular examples of this genre are Ultima, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and Fallout.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 29\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n\u2022\n\nMany organizations currently use the virtual world of Second Life to conduct\ntraining workshops. A few organizations have used the virtual world to fundraise\nand build up groups with similar interests.\n\n\u2022\n\nPopular examples of virtual worlds include Second Life, Cybertown, Habbo\nHotel, There, and Virtual Magic Kingdom.\n\nExhibit 3-3: Users are able to socialize in the virtual space Second Life.lxiii\n\nVirtual World Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A sophisticated terrorist network joins Second Life. On a\npassword-protected island of the virtual community, they construct replicas of sites that\nthey are interested in attacking, and carry out realistic, virtual dry runs of their attacks.\n\u2022\n\nThey consider expanding their network and developing an on-going virtual\nterrorist training camp, complete with lessons on the manufacture of bombs, the\nproper use of artillery, and basic lessons on the most effective places to shoot a\nperson to mortally wound them.\n\nBecause virtual worlds can serve as a platform for hard-to-trace communications and\nprivate, sometimes password-protected meetings when members are separated by\ndistance, the terrorist network also utilizes the virtual space for cell management and\nmeetings.\n\u2022\n\nThe meetings help ensure that members are accounted for on a regular basis while\ndrawing little attention to the gathering or the members\u2019 association.\n\n\u2022\n\nVirtual interaction helps team members become familiar and develop trust with\ntheir teammates long before they meet face-to-face.\n\n\u2022\n\nWorking together in games or virtual worlds build teams cohesion which\ntranslates into better synergies in real-world situations.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 30\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFrequent interaction with his network helps the leader monitor the level of his team\nmembers\u2019 commitment to the cause and ensure that they do not waver from the group\u2019s\ntactical and strategic missions. This also helps the leader prevent members from\n\u201cdefecting\u201d or otherwise becoming a threat to the cell.\nSome of the terrorist network members living in a remote location with Internet access\nraise funds via \u201cgold farming,\u201d a virtual form of the \u201csweat shop.\u201d Their laborers play\ngames to develop the best, strongest in-game characters which are then sold online for a\nprofit at sites like E-bay.\u2020\u2020\n\u2022\n\nBecause of the games\u2019 entertainment value, terrorist network members encourage\nplayers to \u201cwork\u201d for them or raise funds themselves by simply playing games\nand then selling items.\n\nOther network associates participate in traditional fundraising. Second Life allows players\nto contact the organizer of like-groups, perhaps \u201chumanitarian\u201d organizations that support\nparticular causes, and send mass emails to encourage participation in special interest\nevents. Donations are laundered to fund terror activities.\n\u2022\n\nTerrorist groups are introduced to new sympathizers in this way.\n\n\u2022\n\nOther associates hold invitation-only \u201ctown meetings\u201d or \u201cgroup meetings\u201d to\nimpress viewpoints upon potential recruits.\nVirtual Worlds and MMORPGs as a Film Set\nMachinima: From Game space to Video\n\nGaming can serve as a platform for propaganda video production. For example,\nmachinima is filmmaking within the real-time 3D virtual environment of a video game.\nAll that is required is a game and a desktop computer.lxiv The combination of machinima\nsoftware and a virtual world or video game such as Planet Battlefield, allows one to film\ntheir in-game activities as they play to develop a film which is easily distributed over the\nInternet.\nTerrorists could easily exploit this technology. Through the use of virtual\ncharacters and audio mash-ups a terrorist could anonymously create machinima films that\nincluded speeches, updates, and briefings. He could use the technology of virtual\ncommunities to create target sites to convey to cell members the next planned attack, use\ngames to give a visual plan of how the attack should be carried out, and familiarize\nteammates with the terrain of the intended site with the technology of Second Life.\nAdditionally, one could use machinima to create a likable, militant hero with whom their\ntarget audience could identify.\n\n\u2020\u2020\n\nDuring the month of December, SAIC analysts periodically checked e-Bay for characters and items for\nsale. It was common to see a high-level character with special skills in World of Warcraft or Everquest on\nsale for approximately US$2,000 with only minutes left in the auctions.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 31\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThis technology, combined with audio mash-ups, also could be easily used to\nincorporate the voices of key heads of state, the US President for example, into anti-US\npropaganda. An original speech could be tampered to craft new, unfavorable messages.\n\nExhibit 3-4: Planet Battlefield; universal resource link located at:\nhttp://planetbattlefield.gamespy.com/fms/Image.php?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetbattlefield.gamespy.com/i\nmages/bf2news/shot7.jpg\n\nMixed or Alternate Reality Games\nMixed and alternate reality games involve the use of mobile technology, GPS and\nonline communication in a real world environment. Because these games exist in both\ncyberspace and the real world, the boundaries between virtual and real worlds are\nblurred.\nAlternate Reality Gaming\n\nAlternate Reality Gaming (ARG), sometimes also called Immersive Gaming or\nInteractive Fiction, is an emerging genre of online gaming and one of the first true art and\nentertainment forms developed from and exclusively for the Internet. ARGs are played in\nreal-life spaces under fictitious auspices, usually using a cell phone, camera and/or\nhandheld GPS device, and the Internet.\n\u2022\n\nThe Internet serves as a \u201cbase\u201d for information on the game, calculating\nindividual or team points, and managing the game.\n\n\u2022\n\nTechnically, ARGs are a kind of MMORPG because of the important role of the\nInternet in the games.\n\nOther than entertainment, ARGs can be produced for education and training,\ngrassroots activism, and promotional campaigning.lxv\n\u2022\n\nTitles of popular ARGs include Orbital Colony, Perplex City, Studio Cyphers,\nWho is Benjamin Stove, The LOST Experience, and Ocular Effect.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 32\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nExhibit 3-5: Sopranos Alternate Reality Game\n\nMany alternate or mixed\nreality games begin as\npromotional efforts. Some\nof the most elaborate cost\nmore than $500,000. To\npromote the premiere of\nthe Sopranos, A&E has\ndeveloped a mixed reality\ngame played both on the\nInternet and in the realworld and involving\nsearches for particular\nadvertisements and other\n\u201csightings.\u201d\n\nAlternate Reality Scenario #1\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist cell is planning to bomb the US embassy in Jakarta.\nAlternate or mixed reality games allow the cell to practice the attack in a realistic\nenvironment with unexpected people, noise, and obstacles.\n\u2022\n\nDuring the dry run, cell members communicate through the operations\ncoordinator, who has access to the Internet and a telephone.\n\n\u2022\n\nAs the members communicate during the dry run in the real world, it looks to\nother people like they are innocently talking on their cell phones, looking at their\npalm pilots, or sending text messages to friends. In fact they are calling\nheadquarters with information on security cameras, wiring, security guards, power\nsources, crowd congregation locations and other data, following maps on their\nPDAs, and communicating with team members.\n\n\u2022\n\nWith location tracking devices, the coordinator could track GPS positions of cell\nphones or capture team members\u2019 movements with other members\u2019 cameras and\nvideo phones.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe cell carries out its mission in the same manner that it had practiced using\nmixed reality gaming tools.\n\nAlternate Reality Scenario #2\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist cell wishes to draw a crowd to a specific location in\nSeattle, and then distribute a contagious biological agent. A cell develops an alternate\nreality game and posts it on the alternate reality game network on the Internet.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 33\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe game encourages parents to take their children to famous landmarks in Seattle and\nteach them about Seattle\u2019s history and culture. With each landmark visit, they will gain a\ncertain amount of points. Whoever collects 1,000 points will receive free entry to a\npopular local attraction on a particular day. The cell persuades the Seattle Science\nMuseum to grant free entry to winners in exchange for publicity.\n\u2022\n\nParents and children tour the city, collecting points when they take photos of\nparticular landmarks or barcodes pre-posted around town. When they collect\n1,000 points, they are sent a text message that says they have won a free day at\nthe Seattle Science Museum on February 15.\n\n\u2022\n\nWith a near-guaranteed crowd at the Science Museum, cell members distribute\nthe biological agent on February 15. The \u201cwinners\u201d and others there return home\nand spread the biological agent to families, friends and schools.\n\nGeocaching\nGeocaching is another treasure hunttype game. Using hand-held GPS\ndevices, the players use the information\non the Internet to search for the treasure\nin real-life.\n\u2022\n\nMany times the caches are not\nworth a significant amount of\nmoney, but it is the sense of\nadventure and accomplishment\nthat draws people to the game.\nExhibit 3-6: Screen Shots for Searching for a Cache\n\nTo participate in geocaching, one\nneeds a place to post geocache locations (typically, the Internet), a hand-held GPS\ncomponent, and a \u201ctreasure.\u201d Typically, geocachers sign up for an account on a\ngeocaching site. Once on the site, they can search for geocaches that others have left.\n\u2022\n\nSimilarly, they can hide a cache and post its coordinates for other people to find.\n\n\u2022\n\nGeocaching\u2019s popularity has spread across Europe and the United States.\n\n\u2022\n\nAsia and Africa also are home to many participants.\n\nThe caches are ranked in terms of difficulty to find, the terrain, and the type of cache.\nOnce a cache is found, the geocacher typically will sign a log book at the site or via the\nwebsite to inform people that it has been found.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 34\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nGeocaching Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist cell leader has cell members build and transport a\nbomb to a detonation spot \u2013a naval watch station between Los Angeles and San Diego \u2013\nusing geocaching.\n1. Cell member #1 buys a component of the bomb near Reno, Nevada. He then\nstashes his purchase for the next member to find in south-central Nevada.\n2. Cell member #2 knows only the code name of cell member #1. He knows that #1\nwill be hiding a partially built bomb that requires the component that he has\nbought. He watches and waits for a posting by #1 of a location within the\npredetermined 100 miles from his base. When #1 posts, he rushes out to find the\ncache, takes the developing bomb, adds his component, and takes it to a place\nwithin 100 miles of the south-eastern Utah-Nevada border.\n3. Cell member #3 repeats the same process as cell member #2. This process\ncontinues until the bomb is completed.\n4. The final cell member takes the bomb to the naval watch station and detonates it\nas planned. No red flags were raised because the transport and purchase of the\nbomb components were spread out across four states.\nExhibit 3-7: Geocaching Construction and Transportation Scenario\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 35\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nSimulation Games\nSimulation games allow gamers a chance to experience and practice a role, activity or\nskill in the safety of the virtual world. Popular experiences in these games include flying,\nracing, sporting, and building.\n\u2022\n\nThere are many kinds of users of simulation games. For example, to train soldiers\nthe United States military uses simulation games including flight simulators,\nurban warfare simulations, and even communication simulations for deployment\nin foreign countries.\n\n\u2022\n\nLikewise, terrorist cells could use simulation games for communication,\nrecruitment and team management as well as for dry-runs of missions.\n\n\u2022\n\nSome of the most successful titles include Microsoft Flight Simulator, Gran\nTurismo, Madden NFL, and SimCity.\n\nSimulation Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist leader wants to stage a biological and chemical\nattack on several Washington, DC, Metro stations simultaneously. The cell leader would\nlike to simulate all stages of such an attack including the construction, transportation and\nimplementation of the plan. Basic benefits of a simulated attack include:\n\u2022\n\nCell members use virtual simulation to monitor times and locations to carry out\nan attack across multiple stations.\n\n\u2022\n\nCell members use virtual simulation to case the environment prior to the attack in\norder to identify and mitigate potential obstacles.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe cell leader is able to integrate digital imagery and simulated sounds to\nacclimate operators in order that they execute the attack more effectively.\n\nMapping programs such as Google earth can be integrated into online simulation games\nto reconstruct streets, buildings and other topographical features near potential attack\nsites.\n\u2022\n\nThe cell leader integrates information provided by the city inspector\u2019s office,\nincluding actual building codes and utility locations to generate more accurate\ngame construction.\n\nA software program that simulates hospital and laboratory environments is uploaded into\nthe game space. The software is intended for training medical staff and laboratory\ntechnicians about safe handling and storage of dangerous chemicals and biological\nagents. It also trains first responders on containing spills. Cell members use this\nprogram to learn safe handling, transport and deployment of the chemical and biological\nagents they will use.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 36\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nUtilizing actual plans for the Metro system provide insight into tunnel and station\nstructures. Such plans accurately portray the location and significance of key power\nsources, ventilation ducts, and other infrastructure features critical to an effective\nbiological attack.\n\u2022\n\nThe cell leader utilizes software that scans the structural and architectural plans of\nkey structures to create a 3-D virtual metro system. He then places the virtual\nMetro system on a password protected island in a virtual world and shares the\npassword with other cell members.\n\nAdditional details are entered into the virtual metro station using the same techniques.\nCell members casing the \u2018real\u2019 metro system identify security checks, including camera\nand video installations and then program their locations.\n\u2022\n\nBy integrating these systems into the simulated metro system, the cell members\nidentify and overcome obstacles through trial and error. Identifying and inputting\npassenger traffic patterns through the Metro system further enables accuracy in\nplanning and executing attacks.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe breadth of data and sophistication of the software programs allows the cell to\nperform damage assessments against each scenario to help predict which\nconditions would be most effective in delivering a chemical or biological\ninfections.\n\nThrough their dry runs, experimentation and practice, the simulation, in its entirety,\ndetermine the optimal operation while maximizing the effectiveness and impact.\nAs the scenarios are being planned and practice, the cell leader obtains sensors to monitor\ncell members\u2019 biological responses. Further, some games have features that allow\nleaders to monitor player statistics.\n\u2022\n\nHe hooks the cell members up to these sensors and has them perform various\ntasks related to the simulation and monitors their responses.\n\n\u2022\n\nThis helps the cell member determine the roles of the members based on their\nnatural responses.\n\n\u2022\n\nIt also helps identify training or conditioning that must occur before the mission.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe cell member also tracks player performance and time spent in the simulation\nthrough in-game player performance statistics.\n\nThrough the cell\u2019s dry runs, the team becomes comfortable with their roles during the\nmission, thereby reducing the margin of error.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 37\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n\u2022\n\nEach member knows their roles and what their colleagues will be doing\nsimultaneously.\n\n\u2022\n\nThey practice scenarios that may occur during the mission and determine how to\nact.\n\n\u2022\n\nThey are now less susceptible to surprises.\n\nThrough research and in-game simulation, it is determined that maximum impact can be\nexpected using three bombers in each of four Metro stations -- Metro Center, Gallery\nPlace, Union Station, Capitol South, and L\u2019Enfant -- at 8:45 AM on a Tuesday in lateMarch. Each cell member knows their responsibilities and the timing on their\nmovements.\n\nKnowledge-Based Games\nKnowledge-based games are a proven success in teaching. Many organizations have\nbegun to develop video and other games to teach children about their work or mission.\n\u2022\n\nThe United Nations, for example, provides Food Force for free via the UN\nwebsite. The game aims to teach children about global hunger and food aid.\n\n\u2022\n\nLikewise, Middle Eastern groups have attempted to influence children via games.\nThe Islamic Fun suite contains the game The Resistance which carries the\nfollowing introduction to the game, \u201cYou are a farmer in South Lebanon who has\njoined the Islamic Resistance to defend your land and family from the invading\nZionists.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nOther popular titles include Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Blue\u2019s\nClues: Blues Big Musical and, one of the first educational video games, Oregon\nTrail.\n\nKnowledge-Based Game Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade would like to teach children about\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The group knows that vivid, interactive games are likely\nto entertain children while providing an effective education platform. They develop a\ngame from the Palestinian point-of-view that distorts history by embellishing atrocities\ncommitted by the Israelis, and minimizing culpability of the Palestinians.\n\u2022 In order to win the game, the young player must answer questions correctly to\nsave his family and friends.\n\u2022\n\nA correct answer, as deemed by the sympathizer, gets the child one step closer to\nParadise.\n\n\u2022\n\nDuring each scenario, there are questions about religion, Israeli beliefs and moral\nresponsibility [see below].\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 38\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nIn-game Quiz Example:\nThe Israeli military on the Palestinian border is positioned there to:\nA.\n\nProvide protection for all non-military citizens crossing the border between Israel and\nPalestine regardless of nationality or religion.\nB. Protect all Christian non-military citizens.\nC. Protect all Christians and kill Muslims, including women and children to\nprevent the creation of more Islamic people and to slowly claim land that is not\ntheirs.\n\u2022\n\nWhen children answer three quiz questions right, they progress to the next moral\ndilemma in the game - they are presented with a scenario out of \u201chistory.\u201d Based\non the scenario presented, they must choose the right moral action to continue on\nwith their journey towards Paradise [see Interactive Story Example below].\n\nInteractive Story Example:\nIsraeli soldiers came to your home last night. You saw the men coming in time to take\ncover behind the house with your three-year-old brother. Your mother, older sister, and\nfather where brutally attacked and killed. You and your younger brother survived the\nattack.\nLater, your neighbor\u2019s brother has come to pay his respects. He is a member of the\nIslamic resistance and offers to help you avenge the murder of your family. He assures\nyou that if you choose to join the jihad you will have the opportunity to fight and should\nyou sustain any injury, he promises you that your youngest brother will be cared for.\nTime is of the essence, however, and the freedom fighters are expecting your decision\ntonight. What will you do?\nYour options are:\nA. Refuse their offer.\nYou thank the freedom fighter, but resign yourself to live under Israeli occupation. Your\nfather would understand. You are trying to protect yourself and younger brother,\nalthough you know that the Israeli forces could come again at any time.\nB. Not respond to the offer.\nYour family has already been destroyed and you do not want to worsen the situation.\nBeware, however, as your failure to join the Islamic resistance essentially means that you\nare complying with the Zionist occupation.\nC.\n\nJoin the resistance and offer yourself as a suicide bomber.\nYou begin training today.\nYou volunteer to serve the jihad as a suicide bomber. This is an honorable post. You will\nbe rewarded and your family will be protected. You will be a hero in your community.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 39\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nWhen you carry out your mission, you cause the death of the Israeli soldiers who killed\nyour mother, sister and father. You are celebrated as a hero throughout the\nneighborhood. Your brother is taken care of and respected for your sacrifice.\n\nStrategy Games\nStrategy games focus on careful planning and resource management in order to\nachieve victory. Many of these games can be likened to traditional tabletop war games,\noccurring in either a turn-based or real-time situation.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nReal time strategy games (RTS) have become the predominant game in this genre.\nPopular titles in turn-based or real-time strategy games include Starcraft,\nWarcraft, Civilization, Master of Orion, Command & Conquer, and Age of\nEmpires.\n\nTraditionally, strategy games have focused on military movements. In today\u2019s\ninformation technology environment however, strategy games teach business\nmanagement and negotiation skills.\n\u2022\n\nTerrorists might use strategy games to teach new leaders fundraising techniques,\nmission planning, and how to manipulate cell members into complete missions.\n\nStrategy Game Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist group would like to engage younger players and\ndistribute propaganda to a segment of the population that will be important in future Jihad\nefforts. The group would like to also determine if there are any players that fit the profile\nof their recruiters.\nThe terrorist group develops a game that simulates the duties and camaraderie of their\nIslamic brothers in Jihad. The terrorists build into the game lodging, rank and file roles,\nbenefits of those roles and a weapons structure that allows players with higher status to\nhave better weapons. The strategy in the game is to not only overcome their enemies (in\nthis case a corrupt official police force) but they must also become leaders of their\nbrothers to obtain better weapons and benefits within the group. The setting of the game\nbegins when a young, strong Iraqi sees neighbor after neighbor murdered by corrupt\npolice.\n\u2022\n\nThe player must build citizen armies to counter the corrupt police forces.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe player must train his troops, as well as raise funds.\n\n\u2022\n\nHe must avoid the crowd turning against him.\n\nThe game is distributed for free to reach the greatest number of people and can be played\namongst other members by connecting to the Internet. Members of the terrorist group\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 40\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nwhich produced the game also play the game and assess other players\u2019 strategy skills and\ncommitment to the cause. Cell members engage the players in conversation to determine\ninformation about them and ultimately determine if they would be a good candidate for\nrecruitment.\n\nChapter Addendum\nThis paper discusses possible terrorist use of different types of games in training,\nplanning, recruiting, communications, fundraising, and propaganda efforts. While all of\nthese scenarios are possible in many areas of the world, only some may be possible in\nareas where Internet connectivity, hardware, or other dependencies are limited.\n\u2022\n\nA follow-on study might discuss location-specific scenarios in target areas.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 41\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 42\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nChapter Introduction\nEmerging trends in the gaming space will have profound effects on the industry,\nfueling its expansion into previously untapped markets and affording terrorist\norganizations greater opportunities to reach and target core audiences.\n\u2022\n\nEmerging trends in the gaming industry will be used to the advantage of groups\ncommitted to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals. \u2021\u2021 Terrorist\norganizations have already demonstrated the capability to utilize technological\nadvances to enhance their operations as demonstrated with their extensive use of\nthe Internetlxvi. As emerging trends come to fruition in burgeoning markets, it is\nonly a matter of time before terrorist organizations further exploit these trends in\nthe gaming space for similar purposes.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe multiple uses of an expanded game space will be numerous, and from the\nterrorists' perspective, invaluablelxvii. Terrorist will be able use the enhanced\ngame space to conduct a range of operations, from supporting strategic\npropaganda and influence activities, to more highly instrumental uses such as\ncommunication, fundraising and recruitment. \u00a7\u00a7\n\nEmerging trends in the gaming industry will continue to drive culture, technology\nand creativity in both mature and previously untapped markets. They are expected to\nserve as a catalyst for the gaming industry\u2019s rapid growth across age, gender and\ncultural boundaries.\n\u2022\n\nMany emerging gaming trends are enabled by the spread of existing\ntechnologies and the advent of new ones. Three major technological drivers\npropelling the gaming industry into untapped markets will be the diffusion of\nbroadband Internet access, the maturation of the mobile platform, and the fruition\nof reliable wireless communication networks such as Third Generation (3G) and\nFourth Generation (4G) networks. Collectively, these trends will improve access\nand make online gaming in nascent markets a reality.\n\n\u2022\n\nEmerging trends will continue to spur the gaming space ensuring its growth\ncontinues at near exponential rates.*** Evidence of trends spurring the gaming\nindustry can be seen in the growth of virtual worlds like Lineage, Everquest,\nWorld of Warcraft (WOW) and Second Life. Hugely popular, these virtual worlds\nhave evolved due to technological advances such as the evolution in Computing\nProcessing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), peak throughput\n\n\u2021\u2021\n\nGabriel Weimann makes this point regarding the Internet but his argument can be extended to the game\nspace due to many similarities between the two mediums. For more information, see Weimann, Gabriel.\n\"www.terror.net: How Modern Terrorism Uses the Internet\" United States Institute of Peace, Special\nReport 116.\n\n***\n\nOnline gaming has been growing at rapid rates in both mature and nascent markets, in particular within\nVirtual Worlds. Evidence can be seen in both the revenue generated by the gaming industry and the sheer\nnumber of gamers which cross cultural, gender and age boundaries.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 43\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\npower, the spread of broadband Internet access, and the integration of\ncommunication technologies. Newer technologies and emerging consumer usage\npatterns are expected to continue to spur growth in the future within the gaming\nsector.\n\u2022\n\nChanges have occurred at a rapid pace within the gaming space and emerging\ntrends indicate more changes are forthcominglxviii. Many trends will change how\nplayers interact with games and with each other through games as trends come to\nfruition. As interactive gaming changed how an entire generation saw itself in\nrelation to the world in mature markets, it will also likely change how generations\nsee themselves in nascent markets.\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\n\u2022\n\nThe overall impact of emerging trends in burgeoning markets is expected to\nmirror the experience of more mature markets, though marked differences will\nexist. Gaming will become a powerful medium, playing an important host to a\nrange of ordinary human affairs, particularly in the online space. \u2021\u2021\u2021 Like the\nUnited States and Asian experience, the line between the virtual and real world\nwill blur for some and become non-existent for otherslxix. However, noticeable\ndifferences will emerge, particularly in consumer usage patterns such as gaming\nplatforms (i.e. personal computers, consoles, and handheld devices) and access\nmethods (i.e. Internet Cafes and wireless networks) due to the limitations\nassociated with existing infrastructures and costs of deploying new ones.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\nThe impact of interactive gaming has profound effects beyond the game space. Evidence can be seen in\nhow gamers learn, problem solve and relate to the real world.

Industry analysts expect the growth of high speed Internet to initially\nbe more limited to Internet Cafes in the Middle East and Africa as opposed to\nindividual households due to the expense associated with deploying fixed-line or\n\u2018wired\u2019 infrastructures. Consequently, industry analysts expect broadband\nwireless solutions to play a larger role in driving gaming in these markets,\nparticularly with the launch of Third Generation (3G) wireless services.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 45\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nBroadband Growth Drives Online Gaming lxxiv\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005p\n\n2006p\n\n2007p\n\n2008p\n\n2009p\n\n2010p\n\nCAGR*\n\n62.0\n\n45.1\n\n38.3\n\n22.2\n\n17.6\n\n15.2\n\n11.5\n\n11.3\n\n9.9\n\n13.10\n\n77.8\n\n75.0\n\n50.0\n\n38.1\n\n32.8\n\n24.7\n\n20.8\n\n16.4\n\n14.8\n\n21.7\n\n84.6\n\n54.2\n\n62.2\n\n38.3\n\n26.5\n\n27.6\n\n22.4\n\n16.5\n\n13.6\n\n21.2\n\n133.3\n\n71.4\n\n66.7\n\n50.0\n\n33.3\n\n25.0\n\n32.0\n\n24.2\n\n19.5\n\n26.7\n\n105.8\n\n75.7\n\n113.3\n\n31.2\n\n26.4\n\n20.0\n\n16.3\n\n12.6\n\n10.9\n\n17.1\n\nOnline Video Game\nSubscribers - EMEA\n150.0 180.0 78.6\n*CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate\n\n60.0\n\n50.0\n\n50.0\n\n33.3\n\n25.0\n\n20.0\n\n35.1\n\nBroadband Subscribers U.S.\nOnline Video Game\nSubscribers - U.S.\nBroadband Subscribers \u2013\nAsia\nOnline Video Game\nSubscribers - Asia\nBroadband Subscribers EMEA\n\nExhibit 4-1: Comparison of Broadband and Online Gaming\nGrowth Rates in US, Asia and EMEA markets.\n\nThe advent of high speed internet access fundamentally transformed gaming into a\ntruly networked experience making gaming an online social experience.\n\u2022\n\nBroadband connectivity makes the stereotype of the lonely gamer spending long\nhours in social isolation no longer tenable. What once was a relatively stand alone\napplication on the early personal computers and console gaming platforms is now\nbecoming increasingly social with the growth of Local Area Network (LAN)\ngames and the expansion of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG).\nGaming is now a social experience with users interacting with others in the game\n(i.e. teams, clans, and guilds), online in other cyber mediums (i.e. web sites,\nmessage boards and social networking sites), and in cybercaf\u00e9s.\n\n\u2022\n\nEvidence is emerging of a budding online gaming culture in Central, Southeast,\nand Southwest Asia powered by broadband Internet access. Many older but\nenduring titles are being played by gamers at numerous Internet cafes.\nCounterstrike is played extensively throughout the region with gamers\nparticipating from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, United Arab\nEmirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia.****\nAlso, Kuma Games indicated that 20% of its total audience originated in the\nMiddle East region with significant amounts of game traffic coming from Egypt\n\n****\n\nCounter-Strike is considered the most popular online first-person shooter (FPS) game in the world with\nthe more than 200,000 players playing simultaneously and contributing more than 5.5 billion minutes of\nplaying time each month on the official network consisting of more than 100,000 servers. Counter-Strike is\nplayed extensively throughout Central, Southeast, and Southwest Asia in addition to the core U.S.,\nEuropean and Asian markets.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 46\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nand a notable number of players originating from Iran and Iraq during the height\nof media coverage on Middle East networks like Al-Jazeera.\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\nExhibit 4-2: Kuma Wars Game Play Distribution in EMEA Markets\n\nThird Generation (3G) and Beyond\nThe emergence of reliable broadband wireless technology will make mobile gaming\na reality in mature and nascent markets in the mid to long term.\n\u2022\n\nThe movement to 3G networks will facilitate the development of 3D mobile\ngames and spur demand due to increased access speeds of up to 2 Megabits per\nsecond (Mbps).lxxv While more mature markets in Europe and parts of Asia have\nwell developed 3G networks, many parts of the world are more limited with 3G\njust in its infancy or stuck on older 2G networks.\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021\n\n\u2022\n\nSimilar to the connection between the growth of online games and broadband\nInternet access, the maturation of wireless gaming will depend on the spread and\ndevelopment of high speed wireless networks. Based on anticipated growth in the\nwireless sector, EMEA markets are expected to see the biggest growth in wireless\ngaming. Market analysts project wireless gaming in the EMEA to expand from\n792 million in 2005 to 2.7 billion in 2010, representing a compound annual\ngrowth rate of 27.9%.lxxvi\n\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\nKuma Wars is made by Kuma Games, who develops free, episodic games for their users based on\nrecent real world events. Kuma is easily able to produce immersive, realistic games in little time with the\nassistance of the Valve\u2019s Source game engine, modular software that provides enhancements in several\nkey areas of game production, including character animation, advanced AI and real-world physics.\n\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021\nFor an overview of wireless generations, see CNET Review: Quick Guide to 3G Cell Phone Service.\nCNET.

Japan and China recently\nsigned a memorandum to cooperate on\n\nExhibit 4- 4: Wireless Generations: Technology,\nSpeed and Features\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 48\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\ndeveloping and rolling out a common\nstandard with a goal of deploying a 4G\nnetwork by 2010. lxxix\nWireless gaming will be more predominant than \u2018wired\u2019 gaming in some markets\nwhere existing cellular infrastructures are more prevalent.\n\u2022\n\nWireless networks are faster and cheaper in Europe and Asia where cellular\nnetworks are more abundant than fixed line infrastructures, leading many\nindustry experts to project significant growth in the wireless gaming industry.\nAs such many countries will build upon existing cellular networks taking market\nshare from declining fixed-line markets. This trend can already be seen in parts\nof the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar where they are\ntesting 3G services following its successful introduction in Bahrain and\nIsrael.lxxx\n\n\u2022\n\nThe emergence of Wi-Fi hot spots are also an important development for\ngaming. In many parts of the world, cities are deploying Wi-Fi hot spots to\nincrease network connectivity and in some instances gaming companies are\npartnering with telecommunications firms. For instance, Nintendo recently\npartnered with BT Openzone to establish hot spots in the UK to enable mobile\ngaming.lxxxi\n\nThe Maturation of the Mobile Platform\nRapid growth of the mobile market in mature and emerging regions will expand the\nreach of the mobile gaming space exponentially.\n\u2022\n\nStrong growth is expected in the mobile sector with expansion rates ranging\nfrom 30% to 35% a year, bringing the industry\u2019s value to an estimated worth of\nUS$6 billion by 2010.lxxxii Rapid growth in the mobile industry will continue to\nbe spurred by the explosion of \u2018data\u2019 applications (i.e. text, ring tones, streaming\nvideo) to include gaming and the further convergence of these applications,\ntransforming the cellular phone into an integrated mobile platform moving well\nbeyond voice. lxxxiii Such growth will expand both the mobile market and in turn\nthe mobile gaming space.\n\n\u2022\n\nGaming has already become a major player in the mobile space competing with\nother popular data applications. Last year marked the first time consumers spent\nmore downloading games than ringtones, a significant milestone considering the\npopularity of ringtones worldwide.lxxxiv\n\n\u2022\n\nThe expansion of the gaming industry in emerging and new regions is also\nexpected to drive the growth of the mobile gaming sector.lxxxv\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 49\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe penetration of next generation game enabled devices with internet access\ncapabilities and enhanced graphics will facilitate the growth of wireless gaming.\n\u2022\n\nThe number of game enabled devices is expected to grow rapidly from about 40%\nof the 2 billion devices available worldwide today to about 97% of all mobile\ndevices sold in 2008.lxxxvi There were 600 million mobile devices sold last year\nalone compared to 300 million consoles sold in the 25-year history of the\nvideogame industry.lxxxvii\n\n\u2022\n\nThe increasing sophistication of new handsets will make for a more\nenjoyable and immersive gaming experience, thereby expanding\nwireless gaming. Currently, most mobile games are simple and are\nsimilar to games developed for consoles a decade ago because the\ngraphics capabilities of handsets are still relatively limited. However,\nnext generation devices are now being designed and marketed to\nhighlight their gaming features like the Samsung SGH-B450.lxxxviii\n\n\u2022\n\nIn addition to mobile phones, portable gaming consoles like the\nNintendo DS (Dual Screen) and Sony PSP will increasingly\nbecome an important part of the mobile gaming space.\n\nExhibit 4-5:\nSamsung SGH-B450\n\nThe expansion of the game space will be driven in a large part by mobile gaming.\n\u2022\n\nA huge latent demand exists for mobile gaming with only 5 % of people who own\na phone ever downloading a game and 50% actually ever playing a game.lxxxix\nSuch percentages suggest a huge untapped market segment that is very\nencouraging to the future of mobile gaming given the number of subscribers and\nhandsets available worldwide.\n\n\u2022\n\nEvidence of the how the game space will be driven by mobile gaming occurred\nrecently when for the first time more games were played on mobile devices than\non console games in 2006.xc In terms of revenues, of course, console gaming is far\ngreater, but the importance of this event in mobile gaming cannot be\nunderestimated given that the gaming industry is largely driven by console\ngaming. More games being played on mobile devices represents a shift in what\nfactors will drive the expansion of the game space in years to come.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe significant difference in the mobile gaming market, as oppose to the personal\ncomputer and console sectors, is that the \u2018would be gamer\u2019 already owns and\ncarries the platform on which they can play the game. Mobile devices also tend to\nbe more intimate devices to their users, always available and always on.xci As\nnewer, more advanced technologies are deployed, market analysts expect\ntraditional sectors like the personal computer to lose ground to mobile\nplatforms.xcii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 50\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe availability and range of mobile gaming content will increase in the coming\nyears.\n\u2022\n\nThe industry is now moving away from preloaded games to models where games\nare required to be downloaded over the Internet from carriers and third party\nproviders. Such a move should enable more third party mobile game providers\nand distributors to enter the market space, increasing both the availability and\nrange of mobile gaming content. Moreover, it will allow organizations to directly\nmarket mobile games to end users.\n\n\u2022\n\nAn examination of more mature markets suggests that gaming will move beyond\ncasual gaming leading to further growth in the industry. Japan represents the\ncurrent benchmark where many users are playing more than just casual games on\ntheir mobile devices.xciii An exceptionally large number of games are aimed at\nwhat would be considered console and hard core gamers, making the mobile\nphone in Japan as much a games platform as any console.xciv\n\n\u2022\n\nSome gaming experts suggest that multiplayer games are the next big thing in\nmobile gaming as they attempt to recreate virtual worlds for mobile devices,\nwhile other analysts suggest that the next big breakout game would be a mobile\ngame that leverages the power of mobile networks and devices integrating\nfeatures like voice and GPS into the game.xcv While industry leaders have\ndifferent views, all are searching for the mobile game that will drive the mobile\nplatform similar to how the Halo, Madden Football and Zelda franchises drove\nsales of the Xbox, Play Station 2 and Nintendo gaming consoles respectively.xcvi\nSuch a game would prove invaluable to expanding the mobile gaming market.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe skills required for a successful mobile game programmer are not\ninsurmountable and include knowledge of Java and J2ME, BREW, Symbian OS,\nOpenGL ES, and/or Mophun. While a skilled programmer would currently be\nrequired to develop a mobile game using one of the aforementioned programs, the\nintroduction of middleware or game modification software in the coming years\nshould enable a broader group to create compelling content for mobile games.\n\nThe Rise of Virtual Worlds\nVirtual worlds will provide the greatest opportunities to support terrorist operations,\nparticularly in the areas of communication, coordination, recruitment and fundraising\nactivities.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 As virtual worlds expand, terrorist opportunities to exploit them will also\nincrease.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\nFor a more in depth look at the various ways terrorist organizations can exploit the game space see an\nearlier paper produced in this series \"Exploitation and Function of Games: An Interactive Influence\nMedium.\" SAIC. September, 2006.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 51\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n\u2022\n\nVirtual worlds will become a powerful medium in nascent markets mirroring\nadoption and consumption patterns in more mature markets. As virtual worlds\nexpand, they will increasingly play an important host to a range of ordinary\nhuman affairs in which participants may communicate, coordinate, socialize,\ntrain, learn, simulate, experiment, build, proselytize and even barter virtual\ngoods.xcvii\n\nThe emergence of virtual worlds has significant consequences because events\nwithin the virtual space at times cannot be isolated from the real world, leading some to\nsuggest that the line between the \u201cvirtual\u201d and \u201creal\u201d world is blurring, even becoming\nnon-existent. This phenomenon can best be seen in a virtual world\u2019s social interactions,\nexperimental learning and value of virtual goods and services.\n\u2022\n\nSocial interactions occurring in virtual worlds are not simulations of human\ninteractions, rather they are human interactions merely extended in a new\nforum.***** Virtual worlds are places people identify with and where real and\nlasting bonds form, for many becoming an important source of material and\nemotional well being. Avatars become a representation of ones identify and\nimmersion into the virtual world increases the identity that one feels to the virtual\nself. This connection with the virtual world invokes many of the same\npsychological triggers as in the real worldxcviii. For instance, reciprocity and liking\nextensively come into play in relationship formationxcix and the process of\ndeveloping ones avatar seems to invoke exactly the same risk and reward\nstructures in the brain that are invoked by personal development in the real\nworld.c As virtual worlds become more immersive and expand into newer\nmarkets, the number of gamers who identify with and form relationships within\nthese spaces will expand.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe expansion of virtual worlds will provide a space for experimental learning to\ndevelop knowledge or hone a particular skill set with practical applicability in the\nreal world. For instance, becoming an effective leader of a guild amounts to a\n\u201ctotal-immersion\u201d course in leadership \u2013 guild leaders are required to be adept at\nmany skills to include \u201cattracting, evaluating and recruiting new members;\ncreating apprenticeship programs; orchestrating group strategy; and adjudicating\ndisputes.\u201dci Absent the virtual surroundings, these skills are prerequisites to\nmanaging and leading any organization.cii\n\n\u2022\n\nVirtual goods, services and currencies have real world value exceeding US$100\nmillion globally. Trades occur in games among players, between players and the\npreset game vendors, and on third party sites like E-Bay, IGE and numerous other\nsites.

Projections indicate rapid growth in virtual worlds during the\ncoming years with more than 10 million online game players in the U.S.\n(approximately the size of New York City) and 30 million gamers worldwide\n(approximately the size of Shanghai, Bombay and Karachi combined).cv The\nbiggest market for virtual worlds remains Asia closely followed by the United\nStates; however, it is only a matter of time before other markets become more\nactive in online gaming.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe expansion of virtual worlds and the growth rate of its populations lead some\nto suggest that virtual worlds may soon become the primary venue for all online\nactivity.cvi The immersive, persistent and interactive characteristics of virtual\nworlds would enable communication, socialization, and coordination in more\neffective ways then other mediums.\n\nThe Explosion of User Generated Content\nUser generated content will emerge as a driving force in the gaming space. It will\nbe enabled by the increased availability of software products and programming\nfeatures, lowering the barrier of entry for users to alter, modify and create games.\n\u2022\n\nThe growing availability of middleware or modification programs enable\nindividuals to modify content (partial conversion) or create an entirely new game\n(a total conversion). Popular middleware products include 3D world building\npackages such as Genesis 3D, Quake, Unreal, and Half-Life; multiplayer\nadventure games like Aurora Toolkit; and systems for handling massively\nmultiplayer games like BigWorld, Butterfly.net, and Terazona. These middleware\nproducts have been used to create successful games like Counterstrike (Half-Life)\nand America\u2019s Army (Unreal); more dubious games have also been created such\nas Ethnic Cleansing (Genesis 3D), Under Ash and Under Siege (Genesis 3D) and\nSpecial Force (Genesis 3D).\n\n\u2022\n\nThird party software products are available and can be purchased for a marginal\ncost, allowing users to create a fully-customizable and easy to design game.\nPreloaded design packages allow a user to click and select from a multitude of\ngaming scenarios to design their own game. Many of these types of packages are\nsimulation packages designed to train users on given subjects. One such package\noffered by Mosbe enables a user to create a simulation to provide a platform\nstrategy development, experimentation, and rehearsal. The package includes\npreloaded military, civilian, and environmental settings in Iraq, Syria, and the\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 54\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nKorean Peninsula, as well as hundreds of vehicles (air and ground combat, as well\nas civilian) and weapons for even more accurate and realistic simulations.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\nAn emerging trend within content generation is using 3D video game graphics\ntechnology to create animated films known as Machinima. Combining aspects of\nfilm making, animation and game design, Machinima allows users to create their\nown film complete with sets, props, special effects, plots and virtual actors at a\nminimal cost. Software products also allow users to capture game video to\nproduce and edit in game events. One of the more popular political Machinima\npieces is French Democracy, a depiction of the 2005 French riots from the\nMuslim perspective.\nHigh costs associated with developing games ($20-30 million per major title)\nhave led many smaller publishers on a path to leverage user generated content,\nharnessing the users\u2019 creativity as a resource to \u2018populate\u2019 the virtual space.\nOpening scripting options allows users to script events ranging from object\ncontrol, to avatar behavior, to mini-games and other complex programs making\nimagination the only limitation of what a resident can create in the virtual space.\nThis provides a unique opportunity for organizations to promote given agendas.\n\nFor more information on MOSBE, see TSJOnline \u201cA Toolkit for the People\u201d\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 55\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nSecond Life Case Study: Content Generation as a Driving Force\n\n******\n\n\u2022\n\nSecond Life\u2019s content creation engine and LSL feature allows residents to create virtually\nanything, protected by very real intellectual property rights. These tools and subsequent\nintellectual property protections have spurred the growth of a goods and services industry\nincluding entrepreneurs (e.g. real estate moguls), artisans (e.g. architects and fashion\ndesigners) and professional services (e.g. notary public), stimulating an economy\ngenerating nearly $5 million in trade between residents every month. The Second Life\u2019s\ncontent creation engine and LSL features also enable residents to be creative and have fun\nwith other residents. One of the more notable examples of unique content is the\nabductions of residents by aliens whereby abductees receive a T-shirt proclaiming \u201cI was\nabducted by Aliens.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nSecond Life enjoys 90,000 hours of use per day, with approximately 25% of that time\nspent creating. That equates to 11 user/years per day, which would require a 4,100member content development team costing $40 million per year. In a given week, 5,000\ndistinct residents wrote original scripts (15%), representing 2.5 million lines of source\ncode.\n\n\u2022\n\nSecond Life allows residents to promulgate any Uniform Resource Locator (URL) audio\nor video stream to local communities in Second Life. Second Life also permits users to\nexport XML data from the game to external web sites. Together, this functionality lets\nusers stream \u201creal\u201d events into the virtual world and \u201cvirtual\u201d events into the real word.\n\nAdvances in Digital Rendering\nAdvances in digital rendering are forthcoming with improvements in Graphics\nProcessing Units (GPUs) and rendering algorithms that will enable game designers to\ncreate more life like images and experiences, further increasing the immersion of\nusers.\n\u2022\n\nExisting GPUs are extremely powerful in terms of computing power enabling\ngame designers to render life like images in games. Currently, low end GPUs\nsurpass high end CPUs by at least two to five times in a wide variety of\ncomputing tasks. GPUs peak throughput power also is growing by a factor of two\n\n******\n\nSecond Life (abbreviated to SL) is an Internet-based virtual world which came to international\nattention via mainstream news media in late 2006 and early 2007. Developed by Linden Lab, a\ndownloadable client program enables users to interact with each other through motional avatars, providing\nan advanced level of a social network service combined with general aspects of a metaverse. While SL is\nsometimes referred to as a game, in general it does not have points, scores, winners or losers, levels, an\nend-strategy, or most of the other characteristics of games. Users, often called \"residents\", can visit this\nvirtual world almost as if it were a real place. They explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in\nindividual and group activities, and buy items (virtual property) and services from one another. As they\nspend more time in the world, they learn new skills and mature socially, learning the culture and manners\nof a virtual environment.

One\nsuch method, parallax occlusion mapping, enables graphic game designers to\nsimulate the illusion of depth on uneven surfaces without increasing the geometric\ncomplexity of rendered objects.\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Such innovation will allow games to create\n3D virtual environments mimicking real world environments.\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021\n\nAdvances in the Science of Haptics\nAdvances in haptics (the study of touch and the cutaneous senses) are expected to\ngrow in the coming years providing sensory feedback and furthering the level of\nimmersion in games.\n\u2022\n\nHaptic devices allow users to experience a sensation of touch and physical\nproperties when they interact with virtual materials. They exert force in response\nto a user's action, at the point of action. They enable active 'two-way' interaction\nwith virtual objects, where action and perception are brought together.cix Haptic\ndevices have been making inroads in gaming for sometime, but recent and future\n\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\nFor more information on digital rendering techniques, see Practical Parallax Occlusion Mapping with\nApproximate Soft Shadows for Detailed Surface Rendering Natalya Tatarchuk ATI Research.

Nintendogs is a popular game that elicits\nemotion through its advanced voice and touch recognition software, helping to\ncreate a strong emotional bond with the virtual pets. Users must talk and touch the\ndog to elicit a response from the virtual pet. Game designer Hideki Konno states,\n\u201cIt is one thing to type in a name and it is an entirely different emotional response\nto call and see the puppy turn its head and run over to greet you.\u201dcx Nintendogs\nhas been an international phenomenon selling more than 4 million units\nworldwide. Also, the Wii, Nintendo\u2019s newest gaming console, offers advanced\ninteraction though wireless remotes where users must use the remote like they\nwould use the item in the game. For instance, tennis requires the user to swing at\nthe ball using different swings and techniques. The introduction of the Wii has\ntaken interactive gaming to a whole other level of immersion.\n\n\u2022\n\nFuture devices employing haptics are not far off with some being marketed in the\nnear term. One device by Novint Technologies, expected to debut later this year,\nallows the user to feel weight, shape, texture, dimension, dynamics, 3-D motion,\nand force effects.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Another product lets users interact physically with virtual\nobjects. For instance, by using a sensor-equipped glove and a force-reflecting\nexoskeleton, you could literally feel the shape, texture and weight of an onscreen\n3-D object.******* Such devices are used now for virtual modeling, medicine and\nthe military, but as costs decrease, haptic interfaces could become more widely\navailable in the gaming space increasing immersion tenfold.\n\nExhibit 4-8: Haptic Devices by Immersion 3D\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\nFor more information on Haptic devices by Novint, see their webpage at http://www.novint.com/\nFor more information on Haptic devices being developed by Immersion 3D, see their website at\nhttp://www.immersion.com\n*******\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 58\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nChapter Addendum\nEmerging trends in the gaming space will be used to the advantage of groups\ncommitted to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals. They will be an enabler of a\nmore mature and expanded gaming space, creating a powerful medium analogous to\nthe internet for terrorist organizations to reach and target core audiences.\n\u2022\n\nEmerging trends will drive growth in the gaming space across age, gender and\ncultural boundaries. Spread of existing technologies like broadband Internet\naccess and the advent of new technologies like next generation wireless networks\nand mobile devices will mean greater access to individuals residing in burgeoning\nmarkets.\n\n\u2022\n\nChanges within the gaming space will continue at a rapid pace. While marked\ndifferences will exist particularly with access methods, newer markets are\nexpected to mirror the experience of more mature markets in terms of growth and\nusage patterns. Gaming will become a powerful medium playing an increasingly\nimportant role in a range of ordinary human affairs, particularly in virtual worlds,\nproviding an extension and a virtual component to supplement their operations.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 59\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 60\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFocus Areas\nThis section identifies and discusses three areas for focusing counterterrorism\nefforts in the game space: in-game counterpropaganda, new game development, and\nintelligence collection.\n\u2022\n\nThese three areas are most effectively pursued concurrently and holistically,\nwith operations in one area supporting operations in the other two, and with all\noperations feeding into analysis of the counterterrorist threat in the game\nspace, as illustrated below.\nCompete for Players with\nNew Games\nOperations\n\nAnalysis\n\nCollecting InGame\nIntelligence\n\nOperations\n\nOperations\n\nExhibit 5-1: Holistic Approach to Game Involvement\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 61\n\nCounter InGame\nPropaganda\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCountering In-Game Propaganda\nCountering extremist propaganda in the game space can be achieved in part by\nbeing an active game player. Establishing an in-game presence allows for virtual\ninterfacing, information exchanges, and developing influential relationships with both\nadversaries and allies. In-game interaction also can help shape real-life attitudes and\nperceptions.\n\u2022\n\nEstablishing an in-game presence would enable identification of influential\nplayers, their guilds and other common interest groups. These relationships can\nbe exploited to facilitate \u201cviral\u201d message spread or in-game dialogue for\ncounterpropaganda purposes.\n\n\u2022\n\nEstablishing an in-game presence also would enable identification of important\npropaganda efforts in the game space. Identification of propaganda allows for\nworking with the game producer to eliminate harmful or misleading information\nfrom the game space and/or for developing a counterpropaganda campaign.\n\n\u2022\n\nEstablishing an in-game presence would aid the determination of optimal\nmessage placement areas \u2013 cued by where propaganda is surfacing and how it\nis spreading in-game. For example, in some games there are large bulletin\nboards or other communication areas that are exploited.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn-game assets might form partnerships with \u201ccelebrity\u201d avatars or popular game\ndesign companies for in-game public service announcements such as \u201cantiviolence\u201d campaigns. Generating in-game public service announcements backed\nby game producers, NGOs or other public interest groups is a popular\nphenomenon in some game spaces. For example, the Omidyar Network currently\nsponsors the Camp Darfur campaign, which is run on the Better World Island in\nSecond Life. The purpose of the campaign is to educate players on the crisis in\nSudan.cxi\n\nExhibit 5-2: Snapshot of Camp Darfur, sponsored by the Omidyar Network, in Second Life.cxii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 62\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCompeting for Players with New Games\nAnother opportunity to focus IC counterterrorism efforts in the game space is new\ngame or modified game development to compete with extremist groups operating in the\ngame space. Working with commercial partners, students, and others in the game\nspace to develop a competitive game and attract the target audience would aid this\neffort.\n\u2022\n\nMarket research could provide valuable insights into the interests and habits of\ngame players from a particular target audience. Using focus groups throughout\nthe game production cycle also would help to identify the strengths and\nweaknesses of the story, graphics, and game play.\n\n\u2022\n\nPartnerships with gaming industry leaders and a gaming advisory board might\nhelp the IC direct the development of new games with the best chance for\nsuccess. An advisory board might be comprised of experts from a variety of\nacademic disciplines and commercial industries, including public diplomacy,\nSilicon Valley, Venture capitalism, NGOs, international relations, game\ndevelopment, and celebrity game players.\n\n\u2022\n\nStudent groups also could fuel new game development. Many colleges and\nuniversities now host programs that focus on game design and production. Assetsponsored scholarships and incentives could be used to encourage students to\ndevelop appropriately-themed game designs. For example, each year the\nUniversity of Southern California (USC) sponsors a video game design contest in\nwhich students compete for a $25,000 grand prize. Students are asked to develop\ngames that could be used for public diplomacy purposes.\n\n\u2022\n\nFinally, it is important to highlight that modifying games (or \u201cmodding\u201d) is a\npopular and cost effective way to produce new games or additional \u201cchapters\u201d\nto existing games. Many companies allow the codes of their popular titles to\nsurface on the Internet because modding tends to increase a game\u2019s shelf life and\nprovides the original game producer time to build a new quality product. An\norganization can mod a game in-house or encourage a member of the modding\ncommunity to make mods independently.\n\nExhibit 5-3: USC promotes diplomacy via new media including games.cxiii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 63\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCollecting In-Game Intelligence\nGaming is an increasingly popular activity among many demographic groups\nacross North America, Europe, the Middle East and parts of Africa.cxiv Monitoring of ingame activities and related game-devoted areas of the Internet such as blogs,\nchatrooms, and virtual periodicals, provide significant intelligence collection\nopportunities.\n\nExhibit 5-4: Joystick Gaming Blog\n\ncxv\n\nFor example, game space provides potential opportunities to identify terrorist\nfinancial operations by monitoring the flow of money in virtual economies and\ndetermining who is involved in the buying and selling of virtual goods and fundraising.\n\u2022\n\nFrom virtual real estate to virtual clothing for avatars, the sale of virtual goods is\nincreasing rapidly. Virtual monies hold real-world value and can be cashed-out\ninto hard currency. Game players trade virtual products in exchange for real\nmoney via portals such as E-bay and Second Life. Intangible goods in digital\nworlds are estimated to be worth $1 billion to $2 billion.cxvi\n\n\u2022\n\nFurthermore, players sharing account information may be utilizing game space to\ntransfer funds from one person to another \u2013 under the auspices of a single player\u2019s\naccount. The ability to upload in-world currency makes this plausible. Studying\nthe activities and profiles of users selling virtual goods might help determine\nwhether or not funds are being funneled by or to terrorists.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u201cGold farming,\u201d or game-supported sweatshops in which workers play games to\ndevelop the strongest avatars which can then be sold on websites such as E-bay\nfor large profits, could be used for terrorist fundraising purposes. Where gold\nfarming is taking place and who is benefiting from the sale of avatars or goods\nalso represents a useful area of investigation.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 64\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nExhibit 5-5: A virtual store in Second Life\n\ncxvii\n\nGame-devoted areas of the Internet such as blogs, chatrooms, online\nperiodicals, wikis, and forums can provide unique insights into hot trends for key\ntarget audiences of interest to the IC.\n\u2022\n\nIntelligence collection of this sort would provide such basic information as which\nnew titles are most popular and best suited for message dissemination.\n\n\u2022\n\nOf particular interest would be commentary on games with political messages\nsuch as Kuma/Wars.\n\nChapter Addendum\nSAIC\u2019s strategic communications division provides unique capabilities to support\ncounterpropaganda, new game development, and intelligence collection in the game\nspace.\n1. Tracking terrorist gaming trends using the SAIC Prototype\nSAIC\u2019s automated processing capability of terrorist Web site content provides a unique\nopportunity to track terrorist online games. Data processing and reporting might address:\n(1) current popular online games and associated discourse, (2) social networks emerging\nin these communities, (3) gaming and community sites that are increasing or decreasing\nin popularity, (4) the emergence of new terrorist gaming sites in cyberspace or current\ngame sites that have been modified, (5) the online spread of terrorist gaming activity, and\n(6) Web sites that host material about terrorist games.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 65\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n2. Organizing a Gaming Advisory Board\nThrough the Cyber-Influence Conference Series, SAIC has expanded the IC\u2019s network of\ngaming experts with varied academic and technical backgrounds. SAIC might help\nleverage this network to develop a Gaming Advisory Board.\n3.

(i.e. the equivalent of the entire population of new york city) and 30 million online game players worldwide (i.e. the equivalent of the entire population of shanghai, bombay and karachi combined).ii while the majority of online gamers originate from u.s. and asian markets, the rapid expansion of internet cafes and broadband technologies will enable the growth of online gaming populations in other regions. for example, the fastest growing gaming markets are occurring in europe, the middle east and africa.iii gaming sales continue to increase by a compound annual rate of 19.1%. sales surpassed 23 billion usd in 2003 and are estimated to reach 56 billion usd by 2008. in turn, revenues reached approximately $6 billion in 2004 and are projected to reach $14.3 billion by 2009.iv popularity gaming has emerged as the preeminent form of entertainment among 18  35 yearold males. consequently, the gaming industry now rivals traditional entertainment industries, including the film and music industries in terms of growth, revenue, and consumption.v for example, the gaming industry is growing by 20% compared to 7.5%, 7.1% and 2% growth rates in the film, television, and music industries during the same period. furthermore, ac nielson predicts that within four years, the film industry will be just one-third the size of the computer game market.vi game users typically spend 20-30 hours per week on online games and more than 20% of online gamers identify themselves as residents of virtual worlds.vii the stereotype of the lonely gamer spending long hours in social isolation is no longer tenable. while some games are played by singular or a group of isolated players, computer gaming now is increasingly social with the growth of local fouo - not for public distribution page 6 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities area network (lan) games played in internet cafes and the expansion of massively online multiplayer games (mmog). users are now interacting with others in the game (i.e. guilds), online in other cyber media (i.e. web sites, message boards and social networking sites) and in cybercafs providing a fertile ground for terrorist activities. it is widely thought that online gaming may have a similar cultural, political, and social influence on todays gamers that music, religion and politics had on earlier generations.viii global patterns in game play: time spent, social interaction and reach games consume a great deal of time and effort by a significant number of players around the world. in a study done by nick yee at stanford university on massively multiplayer online role playing games (mmorpg) users, 50% of the 30,000 respondents worked full time, with only 22% as full-time students. the average age of the respondents was 26.5, (women tended to be older than me) and on average the respondents spent 22.71 hours per week in their chosen mmorpg, a time involvement which suggests that there is a substantial level of emotional investment in the mmorpg environment. global market counter-strike is considered the most popular online first-person shooter (fps) game in the world with the more than 200,000 players playing simultaneously and contributing more than 5.5 billion minutes of playing time each month on the official network consisting of more than 100,000 servers.* counter-strike is played extensively throughout central, southeast, and southwest asia in addition to the core u.s., european and asian markets.* palestinian market reportedly, more than 25% of children between the ages of 6 and 17 in the palestinian territories access the internet through internet centers that have emerged in refugee camps, rural villages, and urban areas. palestinian internet center managers and computer lab owners have reported that most children spend most of their time playing online games, including proarab games like special force and under siege. southwest & southeast asian markets kuma games produces and distributes episodic games depicting real life military operations. these games are played throughout southeast and southwest asia. during the height of media coverage on middle east networks like al-jazeera, 20% of kumas total audience originated from the middle east region with significant amounts of game traffic coming from egypt and a notable number of players originating from iran and iraq.

not for public distribution page 8 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities under ash and its sequel under siege were published by the syrian company dar al-fikr. the player takes the role of a palestinian national opposing the occupiers from israel. under siege, in particular, is based on actual events, but is presented from the syrian perspective. the game employs visceral imagery and sound, including scenes of palestinian children being murdered, summary executions being held in public streets, high-speed chase scenes and sounds of gunfire and heart pumping music. the scenes too are designed to evoke outrage and to play on common themes, including israeli occupation, injustice, and revenge. the iranian islamic students association has also developed an online game, commander bahman, in which users play the role of a special-forces unit tasked with protecting iranian nuclear capabilities from american aggression. this game was developed in direct response to a kuma reality games release, assault on iran. kuma has subsequently developed another installment, assault on iran, pt.3, in the hopes that this international dialogue, sparked by the depiction of global affairs in the game space, will continue. assault on iran, pt. 3 is planned be released in arabic, english, and farsi.xiv video games make particular assumptions within their environment that can transcend a specific message to users. for example, the games ummah defense and ummah defense ii (free for download on the internet), are set in the future, based on the premise that at some point in history muslims will have conquered the world and killed or converted all non-muslims. users act as a member of the intergalactic muslim council, working to protect earth from the sole disbeliever and in his army of robots sent to destroy the earth  it was necessary to construct robots as all other humans believe in islam. the overarching message is that establishment of the caliphate is possible.xv playing games within this context allows users to experience this reality in a sensory way that makes the message real. video games are an ideal influence platform because they incorporate imagery, narrative, camaraderie, and action. this combination works because advanced imagery and graphics can be used to engage the senses, storylines can be used to provide a context and group goals, camaraderie in the form of multiple players facilitates higher levels of engagement, and action in the form of participation is required.xvi radical groups are using gaming platforms to propagate religious ideology. this can take place in a number of different ways. for example, a fps game can help demonize a declared enemy, while educational games can offer manipulated religious doctrine as scripture. fouo - not for public distribution page 9 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities for example, innovative minds, inc. has developed a series of six multi-level downloadable games, entitled islamic fun which are aimed at teaching children between the ages of 5 and 11 years of age about islam. islamic fun is marketed as a faith-based alternative to secular games and includes many age appropriate game titles, including fishing bear, tree hop, and two bunny race. however, embedded in this game package is another game, entitled the resistance, in which users assume the role of farmers in southern lebanon who join the islamic resistance against invading israelis.xvii many believe that these types of games encourage anti-semitism and promote terrorism.xviii communications games provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups and sympathizers because in-game conversations often are difficult or impossible to monitor. many games contain capabilities like voip, chat, and file transfers that allow real-time communications to take place, and few sites monitor such traffics or keep log files as would traditional internet service providers (isps). massively multiplayer online games (mmog) are ideal locations to support secure terrorist communications because of the enormous scale on which they are played. at a given time thousands of subscribers can be connected to a virtual world on various game servers. potentially complicating matters are that some games can be hosted by gamers on their own dedicated server or pc. in-game communication channels would be difficult to collect by current internet control methods, because speech and text mingles with data from the game. this increases the chances that authorities will overlook communications they would normally prohibit. recruitment online gaming can serve as a recruiting tool. this has already proven true in the us, as the us army found that 28% of players logging on to play its, americas army online game also visited the corresponding recruitment site. monitoring strategy games like counterstrike can be an effective way to track individual skill levels in firearms, tactical operations, group cohesion, leadership, etc. this information can then be used by interested parties to evaluate qualifications for military or insurgent recruitment. participation in virtual communities can facilitate off-line activity. members of terrorist groups could enter or monitor online game environments with the intent of translating virtual skills and actions into real world commitments and activities. fouo - not for public distribution page 10 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities training and simulation games can supplement field training by familiarizing recruits with the tactics, weaponry, and skills needed to conduct operations. military type games can be used to help acquire skills in team work, communications, leadership, and operational tactics. this trend is likely to manifest itself in the near future, as games are increasingly leveraging real time data from the battle field. culturally accurate games can help foreign terrorists avoid profile raising mistakes and assist in assimilation. combat simulators, such as those developed by bbn technologies as part of the pentagons darwars project, are used to help soldiers bound for iraq prepare for combat. among the offerings: darwars ambush! a combat simulation game designed to train up to 24 soldiers at a time in military convoy operations.xix increasingly realistic virtual environments further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds  these environments create immersive environments that draw users into the game world. this results in more true-to-life training grounds, and enhances a games underlying message as the user experience becomes more immersive. the us military is currently using games as a tool to equip personnel with training in numerous key areas including, tactical planning, mission rehearsal, incorporating lessons learned, and tactical language training. xx cots programs used to develop combat simulators are inexpensive, widely available, and could offer terrorist groups the opportunity to simulate attacks prior to their execution. such programs could enable fairly accurate damage assessments and provide insight into necessary course correction to limit risk and unintended consequences associated with a particular attack. for example, the maya unlimited fluid simulation software, available for $159, offers users the ability to re-create the mushroom cloud caused by a nuclear explosion. users can control the influence of fuel and other attributes, and add key ingredients such as temperature scale, buoyancy, dissipation, turbulence, and diffusion. games could also be used as part of the attack plan itself. with the rise of mobile gaming, terrorist groups can use the platform to its advantage; instead of planting a bomb near a crowd of people, for example, it can place one at a random location and lead game players to the bomb.* * this is speculative based on flash mobs and mobile gaming use. flash mobs are groups of people that converge in public places for brief periods of time and dissipate quickly there after. flash mobs have occurred worldwide and are frequently organized around political protest efforts. the french riots of 2005 were organized largely through flash mob efforts. paired with mobile scavenger hunting location based or mixed reality games, flash mobs have the potential to concentrate people rapidly at the site of the win. see stories on flash mobs: http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3056735,00.html; http://in.rediff.com/netguide/2003/oct/05flash.htm. some examples of location based games include: fouo -

terrorists and sympathizers use games to twist historical context, demonize enemies, disrupt the social moral compass, and propagate ideology. communications - games provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups and sympathizers because in-game conversations often are difficult to monitor. recruiting - online gaming can serve as a recruiting tool. for example, the united states army found that 28% of players logging on to play its americas army online game also visited the corresponding recruitment site. simulation, practice and team management - games can supplement field training by familiarizing recruits with the tactics, weaponry, and skills needed to conduct operations and planning. money laundering and fundraising - funds used in online games can be uploaded in one location and downloaded in another by using a single avatar to which multiple people have access via id and password. alternately, virtual sweat shops can be organized to d d b ld i il i l i several plausible scenarios exist where terrorist organizations could leverage the power of the gaming medium to achieve operational goals with minimal training and expertise. this paper will outline the current capabilities and potential scenarios by game genre demonstrating how a terrorist organization might exploit the game space. the extent to which games can be used by terrorist groups to supplement their other activities depends on a variety of factors, to include: internet connectivity of game users cost and availability of hardware and/or software required to play game level and kind of interaction between players that the game allows ease of use of game degree of game skills transferability to real-world activity ",

not for public distribution page 48 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities developing and rolling out a common standard with a goal of deploying a 4g network by 2010. lxxix wireless gaming will be more predominant than wired gaming in some markets where existing cellular infrastructures are more prevalent. wireless networks are faster and cheaper in europe and asia where cellular networks are more abundant than fixed line infrastructures, leading many industry experts to project significant growth in the wireless gaming industry. as such many countries will build upon existing cellular networks taking market share from declining fixed-line markets. this trend can already be seen in parts of the middle east, especially in saudi arabia, oman and qatar where they are testing 3g services following its successful introduction in bahrain and israel.lxxx the emergence of wi-fi hot spots are also an important development for gaming. in many parts of the world, cities are deploying wi-fi hot spots to increase network connectivity and in some instances gaming companies are partnering with telecommunications firms. for instance, nintendo recently partnered with bt openzone to establish hot spots in the uk to enable mobile gaming.lxxxi the maturation of the mobile platform rapid growth of the mobile market in mature and emerging regions will expand the reach of the mobile gaming space exponentially. strong growth is expected in the mobile sector with expansion rates ranging from 30% to 35% a year, bringing the industrys value to an estimated worth of us$6 billion by 2010.lxxxii rapid growth in the mobile industry will continue to be spurred by the explosion of data applications (i.e. text, ring tones, streaming video) to include gaming and the further convergence of these applications, transforming the cellular phone into an integrated mobile platform moving well beyond voice. lxxxiii such growth will expand both the mobile market and in turn the mobile gaming space. gaming has already become a major player in the mobile space competing with other popular data applications. last year marked the first time consumers spent more downloading games than ringtones, a significant milestone considering the popularity of ringtones worldwide.lxxxiv the expansion of the gaming industry in emerging and new regions is also expected to drive the growth of the mobile gaming sector.lxxxv fouo - not for public distribution page 49 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities the penetration of next generation game enabled devices with internet access capabilities and enhanced graphics will facilitate the growth of wireless gaming. the number of game enabled devices is expected to grow rapidly from about 40% of the 2 billion devices available worldwide today to about 97% of all mobile devices sold in 2008.lxxxvi there were 600 million mobile devices sold last year alone compared to 300 million consoles sold in the 25-year history of the videogame industry.lxxxvii the increasing sophistication of new handsets will make for a more enjoyable and immersive gaming experience, thereby expanding wireless gaming. currently, most mobile games are simple and are similar to games developed for consoles a decade ago because the graphics capabilities of handsets are still relatively limited. however, next generation devices are now being designed and marketed to highlight their gaming features like the samsung sgh-b450.lxxxviii in addition to mobile phones, portable gaming consoles like the nintendo ds (dual screen) and sony psp will increasingly become an important part of the mobile gaming space. exhibit 4-5: samsung sgh-b450 the expansion of the game space will be driven in a large part by mobile gaming. a huge latent demand exists for mobile gaming with only 5 % of people who own a phone ever downloading a game and 50% actually ever playing a game.lxxxix such percentages suggest a huge untapped market segment that is very encouraging to the future of mobile gaming given the number of subscribers and handsets available worldwide. evidence of the how the game space will be driven by mobile gaming occurred recently when for the first time more games were played on mobile devices than on console games in 2006.xc in terms of revenues, of course, console gaming is far greater, but the importance of this event in mobile gaming cannot be underestimated given that the gaming industry is largely driven by console gaming. more games being played on mobile devices represents a shift in what factors will drive the expansion of the game space in years to come. the significant difference in the mobile gaming market, as oppose to the personal computer and console sectors, is that the would be gamer already owns and carries the platform on which they can play the game. mobile devices also tend to be more intimate devices to their users, always available and always on.xci as newer, more advanced technologies are deployed, market analysts expect traditional sectors like the personal computer to lose ground to mobile platforms.xcii fouo - not for public distribution page 50 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities the availability and range of mobile gaming content will increase in the coming years. the industry is now moving away from preloaded games to models where games are required to be downloaded over the internet from carriers and third party providers. such a move should enable more third party mobile game providers and distributors to enter the market space, increasing both the availability and range of mobile gaming content. moreover, it will allow organizations to directly market mobile games to end users. an examination of more mature markets suggests that gaming will move beyond casual gaming leading to further growth in the industry. japan represents the current benchmark where many users are playing more than just casual games on their mobile devices.xciii an exceptionally large number of games are aimed at what would be considered console and hard core gamers, making the mobile phone in japan as much a games platform as any console.xciv some gaming experts suggest that multiplayer games are the next big thing in mobile gaming as they attempt to recreate virtual worlds for mobile devices, while other analysts suggest that the next big breakout game would be a mobile game that leverages the power of mobile networks and devices integrating features like voice and gps into the game.xcv while industry leaders have different views, all are searching for the mobile game that will drive the mobile platform similar to how the halo, madden football and zelda franchises drove sales of the xbox, play station 2 and nintendo gaming consoles respectively.xcvi such a game would prove invaluable to expanding the mobile gaming market. the skills required for a successful mobile game programmer are not insurmountable and include knowledge of java and j2me, brew, symbian os, opengl es, and/or mophun. while a skilled programmer would currently be required to develop a mobile game using one of the aforementioned programs, the introduction of middleware or game modification software in the coming years should enable a broader group to create compelling content for mobile games. the rise of virtual worlds virtual worlds will provide the greatest opportunities to support terrorist operations, particularly in the areas of communication, coordination, recruitment and fundraising activities. as virtual worlds expand, terrorist opportunities to exploit them will also increase. for a more in depth look at the various ways terrorist organizations can exploit the game space see an earlier paper produced in this series \"exploitation and function of games: an interactive influence medium.\" saic. september, 2006. fouo - not for public distribution page 51 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities virtual worlds will become a powerful medium in nascent markets mirroring adoption and consumption patterns in more mature markets. as virtual worlds expand, they will increasingly play an important host to a range of ordinary human affairs in which participants may communicate, coordinate, socialize, train, learn, simulate, experiment, build, proselytize and even barter virtual goods.xcvii the emergence of virtual worlds has significant consequences because events within the virtual space at times cannot be isolated from the real world, leading some to suggest that the line between the virtual and real world is blurring, even becoming non-existent. this phenomenon can best be seen in a virtual worlds social interactions, experimental learning and value of virtual goods and services. social interactions occurring in virtual worlds are not simulations of human interactions, rather they are human interactions merely extended in a new forum.***** virtual worlds are places people identify with and where real and lasting bonds form, for many becoming an important source of material and emotional well being. avatars become a representation of ones identify and immersion into the virtual world increases the identity that one feels to the virtual self. this connection with the virtual world invokes many of the same psychological triggers as in the real worldxcviii. for instance, reciprocity and liking extensively come into play in relationship formationxcix and the process of developing ones avatar seems to invoke exactly the same risk and reward structures in the brain that are invoked by personal development in the real world.c as virtual worlds become more immersive and expand into newer markets, the number of gamers who identify with and form relationships within these spaces will expand. the expansion of virtual worlds will provide a space for experimental learning to develop knowledge or hone a particular skill set with practical applicability in the real world. for instance, becoming an effective leader of a guild amounts to a total-immersion course in leadership  guild leaders are required to be adept at many skills to include attracting, evaluating and recruiting new members; creating apprenticeship programs; orchestrating group strategy; and adjudicating disputes.ci absent the virtual surroundings, these skills are prerequisites to managing and leading any organization.cii virtual goods, services and currencies have real world value exceeding us$100 million globally. trades occur in games among players, between players and the preset game vendors, and on third party sites like e-bay, ige and numerous other sites. current estimates indicate that a large demand for intangible goods exists within the digital world valued in the range of us$1 - $2 billion making the value of virtual goods quite real. for instance, a world of warcraft (wow) gold piece is ***** edward castronova originally makes this point in regards to communication occurring the virtual space, however, it is appropriate to extend his argument to all forms of social interaction that occur within virtual worlds. fouo -

not for public distribution page 57 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities efforts are moving beyond vibrating gaming controllers and into truly immersive sensory devices. nintendo has been at the forefront of major hardware manufactures and publishers in implementing haptics. nintendogs is a popular game that elicits emotion through its advanced voice and touch recognition software, helping to create a strong emotional bond with the virtual pets. users must talk and touch the dog to elicit a response from the virtual pet. game designer hideki konno states, it is one thing to type in a name and it is an entirely different emotional response to call and see the puppy turn its head and run over to greet you.cx nintendogs has been an international phenomenon selling more than 4 million units worldwide. also, the wii, nintendos newest gaming console, offers advanced interaction though wireless remotes where users must use the remote like they would use the item in the game. for instance, tennis requires the user to swing at the ball using different swings and techniques. the introduction of the wii has taken interactive gaming to a whole other level of immersion. future devices employing haptics are not far off with some being marketed in the near term. one device by novint technologies, expected to debut later this year, allows the user to feel weight, shape, texture, dimension, dynamics, 3-d motion, and force effects. another product lets users interact physically with virtual objects. for instance, by using a sensor-equipped glove and a force-reflecting exoskeleton, you could literally feel the shape, texture and weight of an onscreen 3-d object.******* such devices are used now for virtual modeling, medicine and the military, but as costs decrease, haptic interfaces could become more widely available in the gaming space increasing immersion tenfold. exhibit 4-8: haptic devices by immersion 3d for more information on haptic devices by novint, see their webpage at http://www.novint.com/ for more information on haptic devices being developed by immersion 3d, see their website at http://www.immersion.com ******* fouo -

not for public distribution page 61 counter ingame propaganda games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities countering in-game propaganda countering extremist propaganda in the game space can be achieved in part by being an active game player. establishing an in-game presence allows for virtual interfacing, information exchanges, and developing influential relationships with both adversaries and allies. in-game interaction also can help shape real-life attitudes and perceptions. establishing an in-game presence would enable identification of influential players, their guilds and other common interest groups. these relationships can be exploited to facilitate viral message spread or in-game dialogue for counterpropaganda purposes. establishing an in-game presence also would enable identification of important propaganda efforts in the game space. identification of propaganda allows for working with the game producer to eliminate harmful or misleading information from the game space and/or for developing a counterpropaganda campaign. establishing an in-game presence would aid the determination of optimal message placement areas  cued by where propaganda is surfacing and how it is spreading in-game. for example, in some games there are large bulletin boards or other communication areas that are exploited. in-game assets might form partnerships with celebrity avatars or popular game design companies for in-game public service announcements such as antiviolence campaigns. generating in-game public service announcements backed by game producers, ngos or other public interest groups is a popular phenomenon in some game spaces. for example, the omidyar network currently sponsors the camp darfur campaign, which is run on the better world island in second life. the purpose of the campaign is to educate players on the crisis in sudan.cxi exhibit 5-2: snapshot of camp darfur, sponsored by the omidyar network, in second life.cxii fouo - not for public distribution page 62 games: a look at emerging trends, uses, threats and opportunities in influence activities competing for players with new games another opportunity to focus ic counterterrorism efforts in the game space is new game or modified game development to compete with extremist groups operating in the game space. working with commercial partners, students, and others in the game space to develop a competitive game and attract the target audience would aid this effort. market research could provide valuable insights into the interests and habits of game players from a particular target audience. using focus groups throughout the game production cycle also would help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the story, graphics, and game play. partnerships with gaming industry leaders and a gaming advisory board might help the ic direct the development of new games with the best chance for success. an advisory board might be comprised of experts from a variety of academic disciplines and commercial industries, including public diplomacy, silicon valley, venture capitalism, ngos, international relations, game development, and celebrity game players. student groups also could fuel new game development. many colleges and universities now host programs that focus on game design and production. assetsponsored scholarships and incentives could be used to encourage students to develop appropriately-themed game designs. for example, each year the ",

Our customers and\nstakeholders can rely on us to provide timely, high quality products and services, because we never stop\ninnovating and improving, and we never give up!\n(U) The Environment\n(U//FOUO) For decades, Signals Intelligence has sustained deep and persistent access to all manner of\nadversaries to inform and guide the actions and decisions of Presidents, military commanders, policy\nmakers and clandestine service officers. As the world has changed, and global interdependence and the\nadvent of the information age have transformed the nature of our target space, we have adapted in\ninnovative and creative ways that have led some to describe the current day as \u201cthe golden age of\nSIGINT.\u201d\n(U//FOUO) That reputation was hard-won, but will only endure if we keep sight of the dynamic and\nincreasingly market driven forces that continue to shape the SIGINT battle space. We must proactively\nposition ourselves to dominate that environment across discovery, access, exploitation, analysis,\ncollaboration and in the products and services we provide. The SIGINT system and our interaction\ntherein must be as agile and dynamic as the information space we confront.\n(U//FOUO) The mission space for SIGINT in the years ahead will continue to grow at a rapid pace\namidst a dramatically new set of challenges:\n(U//FOUO) The interpretation and guidelines for applying our authorities, and in some cases the\nauthorities themselves, have not kept pace with the complexity of the technology and target\nenvironments, or the operational expectations levied on NSA\u2019s mission.\n\u2022 (U) Digital information created since 2006 grew tenfold, reaching 1.8 exabytes in 2011, a trend\nprojected to continue; ubiquitous computing is fundamentally changing how people interact as\nindividuals become untethered from information sources and their communications tools; and the\ntraces individuals leave when they interact with the global network will define the capacity to locate,\ncharacterize and understand entities1.\n1\n\n(U) Center for the Study of Intelligence (2010) Where Tomorrow Will Take Us: The New Environment for Intelligence. August 2010\n\n2\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\u2022 (U) Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming U.S. advantages\nin conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneously and exceedingly hard to\ntrace. Such attacks may not cause the mass casualties of a nuclear strike, but they could paralyze U.S.\nsociety all the same2.\n\u2022 (U) The international system \u2013 as constructed following the Second World War \u2013 will be almost\nunrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers, a globalizing economy, an historic\ntransfer of relative wealth and economic power from West to East, and the growing influence of\nnon-state actors3.\n(U) Expectations\n(U//FOUO) The power of information, its short shelf life in the information age and the speed at which\nit moves will set the conditions for how NSA interacts with customers. Transactional, passive or linear\nrelationships will be replaced by embedded, deeply interactive engagements. Existing investments in\ncyber security will by necessity expand across the enterprise to meet the demand and speed of action\nrequired to thwart our adversaries. To remain a value for the warfighter our information must be\nimmediately available at the lowest classification level. The nation will continue to depend upon NSA to\nbe the lead for the application of the science of cryptography, sustaining access and understanding of\ndata even as encryption becomes automatic, transparent and prolific. Products and services from NSA\nwill evolve into forms and across boundaries that mirror the networked and agile manner in which\npeople interact in the information age, and we will share information, responsibly and securely, with\nexternal partners and customers.\n(U//FOUO) For SIGINT to be optimally effective, legal, policy, and process authorities must be as\nadaptive and dynamic as the technological and operational advances we seek to exploit. Nevertheless,\nthe culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary\nauthorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue\nlegal authorities and a policy framework mapped more fully to the information age.\n(U//FOUO) To sustain current mission relevance and to meet the challenges, the Signals Intelligence\nDirectorate must undertake a profound and revolutionary shift from the mission approach which has\nserved us so well in the decades preceding the onset of the information age to a SIGINT system that is\nas agile and dynamic as the information space we confront. The environment demands it, the capability\nof the SIGINT system can achieve it and the work force has the creativity and the skill base to make it\npossible.\n(U//FOUO) What follow are the five challenge goals the SIGINT leadership has established to close gaps\nbetween the environment and expectations over the next five years.\n\n2(U)\n\nLynn, William J.

Originally sponsored by the US Naval Research\nLaboratory, and now backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, it routes a user\u2019s\ntra\ufb03c through several servers in a way that hides the user\u2019s location.\n(TS//SI) We have seen several targets using Tor. Our goal was to analyze Tor\nsource code and determine any vulnerabilities in the system. We set up an internal\nTor network to analyze Tor tra\ufb03c, in the hopes of discovering ways to passively\nidentify it. We also worked to create a custom Tor client which allows the user \ufb01ner\ncontrol.\n\nContents\n1 (U) Tor overview\n\n3\n\n2 (U//FOUO) Objectives\n\n4\n\n3 (U//FOUO) Objectives 1 and 2\n\n4\n\n4

Its creators use a special jargon\nto describe its workings; please consult appendix A, Tor glossary, for de\ufb01nitions. Tor\u2019s\nanonymization works by having a Tor client send its tra\ufb03c through a circuit of three\nservers, each running Tor, under several layers of encryption. This accomplishes several\nthings. Most basically, the Tor servers, many of which are listed on publicly advertised\ndirectory servers, are chosen to act as a series of proxies. This may seem to be excessively\ncomplex, as a single proxy server can be used to hide one\u2019s location, but a single-hop proxy\nis vulnerable in two ways. First, by analyzing the pattern of the tra\ufb03c going to and from\nthe proxy server, it is possible to deduce which clients are making which requests. Second,\nif an attacker owns the proxy server, then it certainly knows who is asking for what, and\nanonymization is ruined. By using multiple hops, Tor is much more resistant to both of\nthese attacks. Tra\ufb03c analysis becomes extraordinarily di\ufb03cult, as it must be coordinated\nacross several machines, and an attacker must own all the hops along the circuit in order\nto trace requests back to the originating client.\n(U) If Tor\u2019s only feature was the use multiple proxies, it would not necessarily mean\nthat it could not be attacked some way, such as knowing which circuit a client will choose to\nroute tra\ufb03c through, or simply reading requests sent in the clear and looking for identifying\ninformation. However, Tor leverages the OpenSSL cryptographic libraries to encrypt the\ndata it sends and to choose random circuits in order to prevent an attacker from gaining\nuseful information.\n(U) The series of Tor servers used to relay a client\u2019s TCP tra\ufb03c is referred to as a\ncircuit. Circuits are set up one server at a time in a way that keeps any single server from\nknowing the entire layout of the circuit. The client connects to the \ufb01rst server. It then\nasks the \ufb01rst server to connect to the second server. Finally, it sends a request through\nthe \ufb01rst server that asks the second server connect to the third server. Each server only\nknows who connected to it and to whom it connected, which is just one server each way\nin the circuit. A more detailed explanation can be found in appendix B.1.\n(U) The phrase \u201conion routing\u201d refers to the way that encryption is layered to hide\ninformation sent down the circuit. When setting up the circuit, the client negotiates keys\nwith each of the servers it will be routing through. Most circuits in Tor contain three\nservers, so the client negotiates three secret keys, one with each server. When the client\nwants to send some data, for example an HTTP GET request, it \ufb01rst encrypts the data\nonce using each key. It sends the packet to the \ufb01rst server, which removes one layer of\nencryption and passes along the packet to the second server. The second server removes\nanother layer of encryption and sends the packet to the third server. When the third server\nremoves a layer of encryption, then the packet is now in the clear, and the server will send\nthe HTTP GET to the appropriate destination. In this way, only the third server can see\n\n3\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nwhat the client is sending, and to anyone outside of the Tor cloud it appears that the third\nnode originated the request.\n(U) In short, Tor uses a combination of encryption and multiple proxies to hide who\nis sending what through the Tor cloud.\n\n2\n\n(U//FOUO) Objectives\n1. (U//FOUO) Become familiar with Tor by setting up an internal Tor network.\n2. (U//FOUO) Read the documentation and code of, as well as examine the packets\nsent and received by, the client.\n3. (S//SI) Develop detailed client speci\ufb01cations and requirements and document them\nfor the community.\n4. (S//SI) Create Tor client libraries to be leveraged by a network-enabled application.\n5. (S//SI) Create a Tor client, using the above Tor libraries, that allows for on-the-\ufb02y\ntweaking of the client\u2019s behavior in the Tor cloud.\n\n(U//FOUO) We feel that we accomplished all of these objectives, as well as a few\nother unspeci\ufb01ed goals. This paper discusses our progress on all of these objectives.\n\n3\n\n(U//FOUO) Objectives 1 and 2\n\n(S//SI) We set up our own internal Tor network on eight machines in the Protocol Exploitation lab. The network consisted of two directory servers, \ufb01ve servers, and 1 machine\nthat was con\ufb01gured to act only as a client. They were connected to each other through\nthe same hub, and we used Ethereal to sni\ufb00 packets that they sent back and forth.\n(U//FOUO) Tor is a large open-source project, and we were able to download its\nsource code and documentation from tor.e\ufb00.org. Most of our analysis was performed using\nsource code from Tor versions 0.1.1.17 and 0.1.1.21. There were no major di\ufb00erences\nbetween the two versions, and the core functionality of building circuits and maintaining\ninter-server connections remained unchanged.\n(U//FOUO) Our analysis was three-fold: we read the protocol speci\ufb01cation, examined the source code, and observed the actual behavior of our own Tor cloud. This gave\nus an excellent idea of how Tor works, allowing us to formulate hypotheses regarding Tor\u2019s\nbehavior which we could then immediately test.\n\n4\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR\n\n(TS//SI) Another major objective was the speci\ufb01cation and development of a custom Tor\nclient library. We developed a library that allows the programmer control over all aspects\n\n4\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof building a circuit and sending data. Our library is as portable as Tor itself, and we have\nsuccessfully compiled and tested it on both Windows and Linux. We named the library\nMJOLNIR, which is the name of Thor\u2019s hammer from Norse mythology.\n(TS//SI) MJOLNIR is a modi\ufb01cation of Tor, and it is ideally indistinguishable from\nan original Tor client. As such, it should appear identical to Tor in tra\ufb03c. To ease this\nprocess, we used original Tor functions whenever possible. However, its main purpose is\nto provide the programmer with greater control over all aspects of Tor. In the normal Tor\nclient, almost all servers in all circuits chosen randomly. Using MJOLNIR, the programmer\ncan build circuits one server at a time, with no limit to the number of servers in the circuit.\nThen the programmer can send an arbitrary TCP payload across the circuit that he built\nand process the response however he wishes.\n(TS//SI) All of MJOLNIR\u2019s most important calls (in setting up a circuit as well\nas sending data) are blocking. This is because the Tor code is inextricably linked with\nlibevent, an open-source library that allows the user to set up signals that can be handled\nwhenever they are needed. Whereas Tor uses events and a function called once per second\nto perform all its necessary checks and corrections, MJOLNIR uses libevent internally so\nthat each function does what it should do before returning control to the calling program.\nIt would be unfair to any programmer to require that any program using MJOLNIR should\nalso be forced to use libevent at the same level that Tor does. We felt that having blocking\ncalls was the lesser of two evils in this situation, as only programs that follow Tor\u2019s structure\ncould possibly \ufb01nd libevent a viable way of controlling program \ufb02ow. MJOLNIR\u2019s solution\nof using libevent internally does make the program slower, but allows the programmer to\nknow whether all of his requests succeed or fail immediately upon return to his program.\n\n4.1\n\n(U//FOUO) Building circuits\n\n(TS//SI) The most fundamental portion of MJOLNIR is its capability to build arbitrary\ncircuits of any length. Using our library, a programmer can build a circuit, use it for some\ntra\ufb03c, then extend it and continue using it. Like Tor, MJOLNIR allows multiple circuits\nto be active at one time, and the user can send tra\ufb03c along any of them.\n(TS//SI) In order to build a circuit, the client must have information about some\nof the servers in the Tor cloud. This information is kept on the directory servers and\ntheir mirrors, and to get this information the client must request it speci\ufb01cally from the\ndirectory. MJOLNIR provides a function, update router descriptors, which automates\nthis process. Once MJOLNIR has the directory, it can build circuits to any of the servers\nthat it knows about. Servers that have middleman-only exit policies are still allowed to\nbe at the end of the circuit as it is being built. However, should the calling program want\ndata to travel across the circuit, it must be using an exit node that will allow tra\ufb03c to\nexit to where the program wants it to go, or MJOLNIR will refuse to send the tra\ufb03c in\nthe \ufb01rst place.\n(TS//SI) In order to build a circuit, the programmer must begin with a call to\nMJOLNIR\u2019s function new arbitrary circuit by nickname, which returns a new circuit t structure with the given server as its \ufb01rst node. MJOLNIR also provides a set\n\n5\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof functions that will append another server to a given circuit. There is also a function\nthat will return a random circuit of a given length, which is provided both in order to\nretain some of Tor\u2019s original functionality and to ease the process of constructing a circuit.\nMJOLNIR is designed to provide as much \ufb02exibility as possible, providing the programmer\nwith a wide array of options for building and extending circuits.\n(TS//SI) In an e\ufb00ort to provide a robust suite of functions, MJOLNIR provides\nerror-checking at many di\ufb00erent levels of circuit construction. Tor servers will fail when\nasked to connect to themselves, but that error will not become apparent until data is\nsent across the circuit. To avoid this problem, MJOLNIR will watch what servers are\nadded to the circuit, and it will refuse to add a server if it is currently at the end of the\ncircuit. In this case, the circuit is not destroyed, but there is at least one situation in\nwhich attempting to add a circuit will result in the destruction of the entire circuit. If the\nprogram attempts to connect to a server that has gone down since being added, then the\ncircuit will be destroyed. This is initiated by the end of the circuit rather than the client,\nso we have no control over it. The calling program should always check return values to\nensure that circuit constructions and extensions were successful.\n\n4.2\n\n(U//FOUO) Sending and receiving data\n\n(TS//SI) MJOLNIR would not be useful if it could not communicate with other computers.\nFortunately, Tor makes it easy for MJOLNIR to send and receive data without relying on\nan outside program. To send data, MJOLNIR must have three things: a message, a\ndestination, and a circuit across which to send the message. Presumably, the \ufb01rst two\nare application dependent, while the circuit is easy enough to build using MJOLNIR\u2019s\nfunctions. Once a circuit is built and a message is ready to be sent, the programmer needs\nto call send payload down circ with the correct arguments, and the message should get\nto the destination. Each new payload creates a new application proxy (AP) connection,\nwhich is only used internally. Normally, outside applications (e.g. a web browser) send\ntheir messages across Tor using AP connections. Instead of creating AP connections when\nit gets a request from another program, MJOLNIR creates an AP connection when it has\nsomething to send across a circuit.\n(TS//SI) Before the message is sent, MJOLNIR sets up libevent events so that it can\nsuccessfully read and write across that connection. It uses the write event immediately\nwhen it sends a payload. It must still listen for a response before returning control to the\ncalling program. In order to provide a reasonable amount of time to receive a response,\nMJOLNIR uses a timeout scheme modeled on TCP timeouts. If MJOLNIR does not\nreceive a response before the timeout runs down, then it will shut down the connections\nit is waiting on and return to the calling program.\n(TS//SI) Theoretically, there should be a way to shut down connections more elegantly than using timeouts. For example, consider if MJOLNIR shut down a connection\nwhen it received a cell that was less than the maximum length. Initially, this seems like a\ngood idea because Tor servers should minimize the number of packets they send by sending maximal-length payloads whenever possible. However, upon inspection of the packets,\n\n6\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 1: (TS//SI) The basic GUI window showing (clockwise from top left)\ncircuits, available servers, and circuit contents.\nservers do not always send maximal-length cells, so this method does not work. Also, as\nfar as Tor is concerned, there is no di\ufb00erence between a cell at the beginning of a message\nand a cell at the end, so there is no easy way to know that a message is complete without\nparsing the payload.\n(TS//SI) Once MJOLNIR receives a cell, it calls a user-set function,\npayload read handler. This is a pointer to a function that takes a string (the payload) and its length. Unfortunately, due to the problems described above, there is no way\nto handle an entire response if it comes in more than one cell; each cell is handled individually. However, by setting this variable (see the API in the appendix), the calling program\ncan do any operation on the incoming cells, thereby parsing out any necessary data. The\n\ufb02exibility a\ufb00orded by this arrangement is largely what makes MJOLNIR\u2019s communication\ncapabilities so useful.\n\n4.3\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR GUI for Windows\n\n(TS//SI) In addition to porting the MJOLNIR library to Windows in a dynamic link\nlibrary (DLL), we created a graphical user interface (GUI) to implement a custom Tor\nclient for Windows.\n(TS//SI) In its current state, the Windows version of MJOLNIR has the following\ncapabilities:\n\u2022 Creating new circuits.\n\u2022 Appending a node to an already existing circuit.\n\u2022 Creating random circuits of arbitrary length.\n\n7\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2022 Performing \u201ccoil\u201d and \u201c\ufb02ower\u201d attacks on servers.\n\u2022 Appending \u201ccoils\u201d and \u201c\ufb02owers\u201d to existing circuits.\n\u2022 Sending arbitrary packets through a circuit.\n(U//FOUO) See appendix F for detailed information on the Windows version of\nMJOLNIR.\n\n5\n\n(S//SI) Tor\u2019s X.509 certi\ufb01cates\n\n(S//SI) The only part of a normal Tor interaction that does not take place under TLS\nencryption is the TLS handshake, which has to be done in the clear. We chose to focus on\nthis tra\ufb03c to see if there was any way to identify Tor tra\ufb03c, since all tra\ufb03c under TLS\nencryption looks the same.\n(U) Tor creates two X.509 certi\ufb01cates shortly after starting up, in the function\ntor tls context new. The \ufb01rst certi\ufb01cate contains a short-term connection key, and\nis signed by the machine\u2019s public RSA key (its identity key). The second is a self-signed\ncerti\ufb01cate containing the identity key.\n(U) A typical Tor X.509 certi\ufb01cate is shown in table 1.\n(S//SI) The string \u201cTOR\u201d appears in the organizationName of both the subject\nand issuer portions of the X.509 certi\ufb01cates. This means that we see this string in the\nclear during the TLS handshake. By also taking advantage of the ASN.1 encoding that\nsurrounds the string in the certi\ufb01cate, we were able to \ufb01nd a byte sequence that appears\nin every Tor TLS handshake. This makes collection easy, as we simply look for the byte\nsequence in tra\ufb03c. See table 2 for the sequences.\n\n5.1\n\n(S//SI) MJOLNIR\u2019s X.509 certi\ufb01cates\n\n(TS//SI) When a Tor server receives a certi\ufb01cate, it will verify that its peer sent it a\ncerti\ufb01cate with all of the required \ufb01elds for X.509 certi\ufb01cates and that its subject\u2019s commonName \ufb01eld exists and is alphanumeric. Tor servers will not reject a certi\ufb01cate with a\nperiod in them, but they will generate a log message to the e\ufb00ect that someone who is not\nusing Tor is trying to connect to the machine. It does not check that the organizationName\nfor either subject or issuer is \u201cTOR,\u201d and it does not check to see that the \u201c<identity>\u201d\nstring is ever present. Because of this, MJOLNIR can easily send a certi\ufb01cate with false\nor random information and still connect to the Tor cloud.\n(TS//SI) To send a falsi\ufb01ed certi\ufb01cate, MJOLNIR just needs an array of \ufb01eld/value\npairs, where the \ufb01eld is the \ufb01eld name of the X.509 certi\ufb01cate (e.g. commonName, organizationName, countryCode), and the value is the corresponding value of the \ufb01eld (e.g.\n\u201cmjolnir\u201d, \u201cpantheon.se\u201d, \u201cSE\u201d). As long as the \ufb01eld/value pair is valid, MJOLNIR will\nput it into the certi\ufb01cate, so that anyone watching tra\ufb03c will not immediately realize that\nthe tra\ufb03c from a machine using MJOLNIR is Tor tra\ufb03c.\n\n8\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nTable 1: (U) Tor\u2019s X.509 certi\ufb01cate\n\u2022 Version: 3 (0x2) This is hard-coded into Tor.\n\u2022 Serial Number: some number Currently, we don\u2019t know if this is a random\nnumber, or if there is some signi\ufb01cance.

This ensures that even if the programmer\nforgets to give a certi\ufb01cate to the program, there will be no identifying information in the\nTLS handshake.\n\n6\n\n(U) Tor\u2019s hidden services\n\n(U) Tor allows machines to o\ufb00er a TCP service without revealing their IP address, using\nthe same anonymization techniques as clients connected to the network. Such services\ncan only be connected to through the Tor network, and are accessed by special .onion\naddresses resolved by Tor directory servers. This o\ufb00ers several bene\ufb01ts to the operator of\nthe service. Such a service can be hosted from behind a \ufb01rewall or NAT, and any attackers\nattempting to perform a distributed-denial-of-service attack will be stymied because they\ndo not know the machine\u2019s IP address. For details on the hidden service protocols, see\nappendix C.\n(S//SI) Currently, there are roughly 50 publicly advertised hidden services. This\nnumber seems low. Given Tor\u2019s rising popularity it seems likely that more than 50 hidden\nservices exist. The ability to locate hidden services is important, as only then will we be\nable to police and/or exploit them. Unfortunately, we were not able to \ufb01nd any good way to\ndiscover a new hidden service or to \ufb01nd where a known hidden service is hosted. For more\ndiscussion, see sections 7.2.2, Locating known hidden services and 7.3, Discovering\nunknown hidden services.\n\n7\n\n(U//FOUO) Possible attacks\n\n(TS//SI) This portion of the paper will be devoted to several possible attacks related to\nTor. Their application is mostly speculative, as we have not implemented any of them\nexcept for the MJOLNIR-related attacks, and we have not attempted any of them outside\n\n10\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof the lab. These descriptions are intended to be used as possible avenues for future\nresearch and development.\n\n7.1\n\n(TS//SI) Denial-of-service-style attacks with MJOLNIR\n\n(TS//SI) An unmodi\ufb01ed Tor client will never include a given server in a circuit more than\nonce. This ensures that no server will have to do more work than any other. However,\nonly the client can check for repeated servers. With MJOLNIR we can build an arbitrary\ncircuit of arbitrary length, violating nearly all restrictions on circuit construction with\nimpunity. This capability allows for many interesting DoS-style attacks as we can force\nother server to do many times the work we have to. Since Tor normally sends packets of\nlength 586, large circuits can heavily tax the Tor cloud in general, and a targeted server\nin particular.\n(TS//SI) The biggest problem with these attacks is that they take us a large amount\nof work to set up. For an n-server circuit, we must send at least n cells to set up that\ncircuit. Building a circuit can take a large amount of time, especially if the servers are on\ndi\ufb00erent continents, as is the case in the Tor cloud. The number of packets generated is\non the order of n2 , and the time to set up a circuit grows similarly. Once the circuit is set\nup, the amount of tra\ufb03c grows linearly with the number of servers on the circuit.\n(TS//SI) The point of building these circuits is to get target servers to handle much\nmore tra\ufb03c than our client machine while not disturbing the rest of the Tor cloud. Once\nthe circuit is set up, this is not a problem. For example, if we set up a circuit in which one\nserver appears 50 times, it will always do at least 50 times more work than our machine\nonce the circuit is established. We can use this for two distinct types of attack.\n(TS//SI) First, there is the possibility that if we had enough circuits running through\na target machine, we could cause a socket denial of service. Each connection between two\nTor servers uses distinct sockets. Once two machines are connected to each other, they\nwill always use the same sockets, but with enough machines connecting to a server, it is\ntheoretically possible to cause a machine to use all of its available sockets.\n(TS//SI) Also, Tor gives servers the option of sending only a limited amount of tra\ufb03c\nthrough the Tor network in a given period (day, week, or month). By targeting a machine\nwith these attacks, we could cause a server to hibernate, essentially taking it out of the\nTor cloud until the next accounting period begins. This could also make bandwidth costs\nprohibitively high for targets.\n7.1.1\n\n(TS//SI) Coil attack\n\n(TS//SI) Our \ufb01rst implemented technique for achieving either type of attack is what we\ncall the \u201ccoil\u201d attack. For this attack, we choose two target servers and set up a circuit that\nbounces back and forth between the two, \u201ccoiling\u201d them around each other. When we set\nup a circuit of nc coils, the circuit will actually be composed of 2nc servers. This is because\nfor each coil both targets are included once. This attack is concentrated, but requires two\ntargets in order to work. This may be detected by an observant sysadmin, but by default,\n\n11\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nTor\u2019s logs do not store IP addresses, so the information would have to come from elsewhere.\nEven given the necessary IP information, the system administrator will see only the other\ntarget sending and receiving large quantities of information. Without further investigation\nand some creative thinking, it is highly likely that the system administrator will assume\nour other target is actually launching the DoS attack. We can leverage the anonymity\nprovided by Tor to protect ourselves from easy detection by simply appending this coil\nonto the end of a circuit.\n7.1.2\n\n(TS//SI) Flower attack\n\n(TS//SI) Our second implemented technique for achieving a DoS attack is what we call the\n\u201c\ufb02ower\u201d attack, and it targets only one server. In this attack, MJOLNIR builds a circuit\nto a random server, then to the target, then another random one, then the target, and so\non for a speci\ufb01ed number of \u201cpetals.\u201d When we set up a \ufb02ower with np petals, the circuit\nwill actually be composed of 2np servers. The \ufb02ower attack distributes most of the load\namongst the machines of the Tor cloud, so at most the target server will suspect that it is\nbeing attacked. But even if the target knows about an attack, it will have to assume that\nsomeone is trying a distributed denial-of-service attack. While the system administrator\nwill likely recognize that his attacker(s) are leveraging Tor, Tor\u2019s strong anonymity will\nleave him with few options. He will be forced to accept it or reduce/eliminate Tor usage\nof his machine.\n(TS//SI) Perhaps the most serious \ufb02aw with the \ufb02ower attack is that administrators\non the petals might notice that their Tor tra\ufb03c is coming from and going to the same\nserver, a violation of Tor\u2019s protocol which clearly requires a custom client. However, the\npetals still would not have enough information to know where the request originated, and\nany attempt to discover this would necessarily break the anonymity of Tor. In order to get\naround this, we could build a petal with two servers between the instances of the target\nserver. In this way, no server realizes that it is taking part in an attack.\n\n7.2\n\n(U//FOUO) Tra\ufb03c analysis\n\n(S//SI) Is there a way to undo the anonymity that Tor provides? It does not appear that\nTor leaks any signi\ufb01cant information about the client to anyone other than the client.\nHowever, it is still possible to analyze the pattern of tra\ufb03c in and out of the Tor cloud to\ntry to determine which clients are responsible for which requests. Tor does not make such\nan attack (here referred to as a correlation attack) easy.\n7.2.1\n\n(U) A basic Tor circuit\n\n(U) The most common activity in Tor is carried out across circuits 3 nodes long. A client\nconnects to a \ufb01rst server, which connects to a second server, which connects to a third\nserver, which connects to the desired web page or other service.\n\n12\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(TS//SI) For this scenario, we are most interested in tracing a request back to the\nclient, assuming that we see an exit node connect to something we deem interesting. The\nworst (and most likely) case is that we will not own any of the servers along the way.\nThere are two types of potential correlation attacks, although both are complex.\n(S//SI) First method: circuit tracing This method requires data on all of the\nconnections for each server in the attacked circuit. While currently unrealistic in general,\nthis is a potentially powerful attack. A small, private Tor network, for example, could\npossibly be completely compromised by this technique.\n(U//FOUO) We also need to have a good idea of how long it takes to send data\nacross the network to another machine. This comes with the usual caveats that network\ncongestion, distance between links, and packet size a\ufb00ect transmission time. Although in\ntheory Tor packets are all the same size owing to the \ufb01xed cell size, in practice we see\ndi\ufb00erent packet sizes, as two or more cells sometimes get sent in the same packet. Despite\nthis, we should have a good idea of the network latency. Actual processing time devoted\nto the cells is minimal, and can be ignored.\n(S//SI) We begin by focusing on an exit node making a connection to material of\ninterest. At this point, we must keep track of all of the connections that node has up.\nWhen the exit node receives data, it will send it back down the circuit that requested\nit. Thus data comes in to the exit node, and then the node will send out data over the\nappropriate connection.\n(S//SI) Unfortunately, the exit node will almost certainly be sending data out over\nseveral connections. We must keep track of all of them. Let the network latency be x\nseconds. When we see data get sent to the exit node, we only need to pay attention to\nthe outgoing connections that send out data roughly x seconds later. We must take into\naccount some error in our timing, to allow for di\ufb00erences in latency owing to di\ufb00erences\nin network conditions. We then make a list of all of the nodes in the Tor cloud that the\nexit server sends data to. These are all potential second nodes.\n(S//SI) The above process must be recursively performed on the list of potential\nsecond nodes. Hopefully this number of nodes will not be prohibitive, but we have no\nhard data about how many nodes a given machine in the Tor cloud is simultaneously\nconnected and actively sending data to. Again, we will use the timing to determine which\nconnections are of interest. This is made slightly easier by the fact that no node will appear\ntwice in a circuit, meaning that we can ignore any outgoing connections from our possible\nsecond nodes to our exit server. We can also ignore any connections made to machines\noutside of the Tor cloud (i.e. clients) because the second server should only be talking to\nother Tor servers. Now we have an even larger list of nodes to look at, and these are our\npossible entry servers.\n(S//SI) Finally, we look at the outgoing connections from the entry servers that are\nsending out information roughly x seconds after the possible second nodes. This is made\neasier by the fact that we are really only interested in connections into the Tor cloud from\noutside of the Tor cloud, so we can ignore any connections made to other Tor servers. So\n\n13\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nnow, we have a large list of potential circuits.\n(S//SI) From here, we watch for more interesting material to be sent to the exit\nserver and repeat the process. We should get a di\ufb00erent set of potential circuits, as not\nevery connection should be active again at roughly the same time except the connections\nalong the circuit for which we are looking. There should be some overlap between the two\nlists. This intersection is our new, smaller list of potential circuits. After repeating this\nprocess enough times, we should only have one circuit, or at most, a handful.\n(TS//SI) This analysis becomes easier for each box that we own along the circuit,\nsince we then know for sure which incoming connection matches which outgoing connection\non that box. This means that our tree of potential circuits branches one less time. Owning\nthe exit server is probably most useful for this type of analysis, since it is the only machine\nknown to be a part of the circuit from the beginning.\n(TS//SI) There are some di\ufb03culties. How many potential circuits will result from\neach iteration? Without some data on the real Tor cloud regarding how many connections\neach server is sending data over for a given span of time, it is impossible to say. It would\nnot be surprising if this number turns out to be very, very large, even with the pruning at\neach step. Assuming the number of potential circuits is not too large to work with, how\nmany iterations of this algorithm will it be necessary to run before we can track down the\none, true circuit? Again, without some real data about the Tor cloud it is impossible to\nsay. Clearly, the more potential circuits we \ufb01nd at each iteration, the more iterations it\nwill take to narrow the list down to one.\n(U//FOUO) The biggest problem with this idea is that Tor will only use a circuit\nfor a short period of time before tearing down and building a new one. Currently, the\ndefault period of time for this is 10 minutes, and Tor checks every 30 seconds to see if any\ncircuits need torn down. So at best there are 10 minutes during which one can perform\nthis analysis.\n(TS//SI) Second method: Black-box the Tor cloud In order for this attack to\nwork, we only need to see connections entering and exiting the Tor cloud. When we see\nan exit server make a request of a service that we are interested in, we keep track of when\ninformation is sent back into the Tor cloud. We then keep track of each client connected\nto the Tor cloud that receives data afterward for an arbitrary amount of time, probably\na TCP timeout. This will likely be an enormous number of clients. Each client will have\na certain probability of being the one that made the request; for example, a client that\nreceives information 2 seconds after the service sends back some data is more likely to\nbe the one that requested it than a client that receives information 10 seconds after the\nservice sends the data. Each time we see the service send information back to that same\nexit server, we track which clients receive data during the right time frame. Each iteration\nwill give us a large number of clients, but we are only interested in the clients that receive\ninformation each time, that is, clients in the intersection of all the sets. The client making\nthe requests must be in that intersection. The client with the highest total probability\nover all the iterations is the most likely to be the target.\n\n14\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(TS//SI) This technique is essentially a wide-scale version of the circuit-tracing technique, and is less precise. However, it should be easier to collect this information, as there\nare currently only around 450 publicly known exit servers, and it is easier to watch connections from 450 machines to the outside of the Tor cloud than it is to watch all connections\nof all machines, as the circuit-tracing method requires. The hope is that the large amount\nof data we could collect for this method would compensate for its less precise nature.\n7.2.2\n\n(S//SI) Locating known hidden services\n\n(S//SI) In the case of a hidden service, the most likely scenario is that we know about\na hidden service and to want to know where (i.e. on what machine) it is located. We\nwould use a Tor client and connect to the hidden service in order to set up a circuit. See\nappendix C for a description of hidden service circuits. For a normal hidden service circuit,\ncircuit tracing would have to stretch across a circuit containing \ufb01ve servers, making it too\ncomplex, and we can not use the Tor black box approach. Things must be done somewhat\ndi\ufb00erently.\n(TS//SI) If we know the rendezvous point (RP), the analysis becomes more manageable. We can set a preferred RP using the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le of even a basic Tor client.\nThis will work for our purposes, but if we do that, then we will be using a normal Tor\nserver as a RP, meaning that it will have several connections through it at a given time.\nIf we program a custom client to choose an arbitrary RP, perhaps even making the client\nbox the RP (see section 8.1), then we can choose a RP outside of the Tor cloud, meaning\nthat the only connections through it will be ones related to the hidden service. For this\nattack, assume that we know the RP, as well as the server that it is connected to for this\ncircuit.\n(S//SI) When the client makes a request, it will go to the RP, which will send it\ndown another circuit to the hidden service. This gives us a chance to to see what node\nthe RP is connected to (call it the \ufb01rst node). Then, we check the timing in the same\nmanner as in the basic Tor circuit to see to which servers it is connected. We can ignore\nany connections that go outside of the Tor cloud. We now have a list of potential second\nnodes. In a similar fashion, we check the timing of all of these to see to which servers they\nare connected. One of these is the hidden service.\n(S//SI) The hidden service will respond, so we will see data come back up the circuit\nto the RP. This gives us another chance to work with the timing to try and \ufb01gure out\nthe circuit. It would be easiest to \ufb01gure out the second node during this step. One would\nhave to see which machines are talking to the \ufb01rst node just before it talks to our RP, and\ncorrelate that list with our possible second nodes from when the request was sent down\nthe circuit. The actual second node should be in the intersection of these two lists.\n(S//SI) As with the normal Tor circuit, this will likely give us many potential circuits,\nand need to be iterated several times before the hidden service is located. There are two\nmain advantages over the same analysis for a normal Tor circuit. The \ufb01rst is that there\nare fewer servers between the RP and the hidden service, meaning that we only need to\nkeep track of two possible branches in the circuit, instead of three. The second is that we\n\n15\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ncan ask the hidden service to connect to the RP as many times as we want, whenever we\nwant. This allows us to perform the correlation over and over again, albeit with di\ufb00erent\ncircuits each time. The more data we have, the more likely we are to locate the hidden\nservice.\n(S//SI) We know that the hidden service will never build a circuit to the RP that\ncontains the hidden service machine, although it can be its own RP. Thus, whatever\nmachine the hidden service is on will never be the machine that connects to the RP. Every\ntime we ask the hidden service to build a circuit to the RP, we keep track of which machines\nare connecting to the RP. Eventually there will be a sizable list of machines that cannot be\nthe hidden service. It is doubtful that we will narrow it all the way down to the machine\non which the hidden service is located, but it will help us prune the possible branches from\npossible second nodes.\n(S//SI) The hidden service may have a list of nodes that it will never use in a circuit\n(under ExcludeNodes in the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le); these will never show up as the machine\nthat connects to the RP. It will, however, use a server listed under ExcludeNodes as an RP.\nAlso, the hidden service may have set up one or more entry guards for its circuits, meaning\nthat the \ufb01rst node from the hidden service (the second node in the above example) will\nalways be one of those routers. If it has only set up one entry guard, that machine will\nalso never be the one that connects to the rendezvous point. This is unlikely, because most\nof the time one sets up multiple entry guards. A \ufb01xed \ufb01rst node e\ufb00ectively shortens your\ncircuit by one hop. So this analysis may turn up the hidden service\u2019s excluded nodes and\nentry guards even if it does not locate the hidden service.\n\n7.3\n\n(S//SI) Discovering unknown hidden services\n\n(S//SI) We did not discover any method to detect previously unknown hidden services.\nIf a hidden service is being o\ufb00ered on a machine that is also a Tor server, there may be\nsome noticeable di\ufb00erence between its tra\ufb03c and that of a typical Tor server. However, a\nhidden service may be o\ufb00ered on a machine outside of the Tor cloud.\n(S//SI) In our time in the lab, we found that running an nmap on a node that is\no\ufb00ering a hidden service will turn up the port that the hidden service is using to deal with\nincoming connections. It can then be directly connected to, outside of Tor.\n(TS//SI) There are several issues with this. We must already suspect the machine\nof housing a hidden service to decide to do the nmap, or alternately, nmap several servers\nin the hopes of turning up a hidden service. Then, the machine running the hidden service\nwill likely have several ports open, and there is no way to tell which port is o\ufb00ering a\nhidden service just by looking at the list of open ports. A hidden service may even be\no\ufb00ered on a well-known port such as port 80. We would have to try to connect to each of\nthe ports we see open on a machine to determine if there is a hidden service being run. We\nwould not even know which protocol the hidden service is running. It may be an HTTP\nserver, an FTP server, an SMTP server, etc. The only thing we know is that the protocol\nmust run over TCP. It is not enough to attempt to connect once to each port, using an\nHTTP GET request. Several protocols must be tried.\n\n16\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(S//SI) Also, keep in mind that the people running these hidden services are generally very careful, and all of these requests and nmaps are detectable by a canny system\nadministrator. We can hide ourselves by using Tor to route our requests, even if we don\u2019t\ntry to access the hidden service the Tor way, but the attempt may well be detected. This,\ncombined with the shot-in-the-dark nature of the whole enterprise, limits its usefulness.\n\n7.4\n\n(U//FOUO) Man-in-the-middle attack\n\n(TS//SI) Because Tor\u2019s X.509 certi\ufb01cates are self-signed, it may be possible to perform\na man-in-the-middle attack using MJOLNIR to forge certi\ufb01cates. Assume that we wish\nto intercept tra\ufb03c between two Tor servers with the nicknames Alice and Bob. They\nwill send X.509 certi\ufb01cates that are structured in a very speci\ufb01c way; see section 5. We\ncan use MJOLNIR to create our own Tor-style X.509 certi\ufb01cate with \u201cAlice\u201d or \u201cBob\u201d\nin the correct location and appear to be the other machine. From here, we carry out a\nman-in-the-middle attack in the normal fashion.\n(TS//SI) However, this only allows us to get under the layer of TLS encryption.\nAs covered in section B.3.2, the client sets up a layer of encryption with the server (for\nexample, Bob) by passing it an \u201conion skin\u201d. Most of the time, this is done using a\nCREATE cell which contains half of a Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake. The contents of this\nCREATE cell are encrypted to Bob\u2019s publicly advertised RSA key. This means that we\nwon\u2019t be able to read the CREATE cell, and we still won\u2019t be able to read the contents\nof the cells that go through the man-in-the-middle. All we will be able to see is 3 bytes of\nheader on the cells that we would relay through.\n(TS//SI) If the man-in-the-middle intercepts a CREATE FAST cell, it will be able\nto read the X value that it contains and create a shared secret with the client, in e\ufb00ect\nbecoming the \ufb01rst server in the circuit. The intended \ufb01rst server can be completely removed\nfrom the circuit, and the man-in-the-middle will see which server is second in the client\u2019s\ncircuit.\n(TS//SI) We did not test this in our work, so there may be issues with this attack\nthat we did not foresee. At the very least, there is still the obstacle of the authoritative\ndirectory servers. They act in a fashion similar to a trusted third party. The directory\nlisting weakly associates speci\ufb01c RSA public keys with speci\ufb01c server nicknames. If a\nserver operator registers their Tor server with the authoritative directory server (this must\nbe done out-of-band), then this becomes a strong association, and certi\ufb01cates with Alice\u2019s\nname will not be accepted unless they have Alice\u2019s listed public key. Thus, it may not\nalways be possible to perform this attack. However, the authoritative directory servers\nappear vulnerable. See section 8.4 for further discussion.\n\n8\n\n(U) Future areas of study\n\n(TS//SI) There are still many interesting and important areas of Tor functionality to explore. As with any software project, there are always bugs to \ufb01x and features to add. There\n\n17\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nare also two major avenues of exploration in the architecture of Tor itself that warrant\nfurther study because they may provide ways to discover important target information.\n\n8.1\n\n(U//FOUO) Expanding MJOLNIR\u2019s functionality\n\n(TS//SI) The Tor code provided a solid basis for our work on MJOLNIR, but every\nmodi\ufb01cation opens up the opportunity for bugs to arise. All of our work was done in a\nsmall lab with eight machines, so the MJOLNIR code must be tested on a larger network\nto see if it still behaves correctly, or if its response time is simply too long to be useful.\nThere remain large portions of code that are only useful to servers that can safely be cut\nfrom the MJOLNIR main code. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to completely\ndivorce the client and server sides of Tor\u2019s code.\n(TS//SI) MJOLNIR still has one major de\ufb01ciency: it cannot connect to hidden\nservices. In order to successfully connect to one, the client must set up a circuit to a\nrendezvous point, then to an introduction point, then must request that the hidden service\nmeet it at the rendezvous point. Doing this much is very important, and with the right\nmodi\ufb01cations, it becomes possible to have a client be its own rendezvous point. As such,\nthere will be only two servers between our client and the hidden service, making a tra\ufb03c\nanalysis attack easier, which may open the way for locating the identity and location of\nhidden services.\n\n8.2\n\n(U) Privoxy\n\n(U//FOUO) Tor is useful only for rerouting tra\ufb03c so that one\u2019s location and/or browsing\nhabits are kept secret. Tor does not examine the packets it sends for identifying information\nsuch as IP addresses. Because of this, Tor is packaged with Privoxy, a free software \ufb01ltering\nproxy. Privoxy\u2019s purpose is to scrub all identifying information from HTTP requests, etc.\nAny Tor user who is not using a \ufb01ltering proxy like Privoxy is probably leaking identifying\ninformation, especially in DNS requests. There may be situations in which Privoxy does\nnot hide all of the information that needs to be hidden for perfect anonymity. However,\nwe did not have time to study the interaction between Tor and Privoxy, and it warrants\nsome attention.\n\n8.3\n\n(U) Tor remote control\n\n(TS//SI) One area of interest that we looked at brie\ufb02y before turning to other, more useful,\nideas was the possibility of using Tor\u2019s control port to control a client or server. Tor o\ufb00ers\nthe option to set up a control port. A control port would allow one to remotely control\nany standard con\ufb01guration option of his Tor server as if he were directly editing Tor\u2019s\ncon\ufb01guration \ufb01le. However, this did not o\ufb00er the \ufb02exibility or power that we needed to\nset up a custom client, so we abandoned the idea early on. This does not mean that there\nis no useful application of using the control port. For example, one may be able to set up\na carefully selected set of entry guards or exit servers (or both) so that suspected target\n\n18\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ntra\ufb03c will always route through friendly servers. There may be other ways of exploiting\nthe control port, including going so far as to modify the target\u2019s list of trusted directory\nservers. This might send the target client to a directory server in which all of the servers\nare friendly.\n\n8.4\n\n(TS//SI) Directory server exploitation\n\n(TS//SI) It may also be useful to study Tor directory servers in more detail. Our work\nfocused solely on the client, but many attacks would be much easier with access to more\nTor servers. The directory servers ultimately control which Tor servers are used by clients.\nWe have found that a server can put itself on a directory server multiple times; all it takes\nis the server running several Tor processes, each having a di\ufb00erent nickname, open port,\n\ufb01ngerprint, and log \ufb01le. This only requires di\ufb00erent con\ufb01guration \ufb01les for the di\ufb00erent\nprocesses, which are easy to set up. That machine will handle a disproportionate amount\nof tra\ufb03c, since it is listed several times. This increases the density of friendly servers in\nthe cloud without increasing the number of servers we have set up. Unfortunately, each\nlisting has the same IP address, which would be very noticeable to anyone who inspecting\nthe directories.\n(TS//SI) A more useful attack would be to fool Tor clients into believing that a\nfriendly box is actually someone else. This could potentially be accomplished by getting\nthe directory servers to list the friendly box as the other machine. That may allow us\nto see more information than the target wants us to see. For example, if we know that\na certain target has a list of preferred entry guards and exit servers, and if we can list\nour machines as those servers, then the target (or second node, respectively) will be very\nlikely to send tra\ufb03c through our machines, making it easier to correlate the tra\ufb03c and\ndetermine what the target is requesting and/or where the target is.\n(TS//SI) There may be many other applications of this type of attack, and for this\nreason, directory server exploitation should be looked into.\n\n9\n\n(U) Acknowledgments\n\n(U//FOUO) We would like to thank the CES Summer Program for giving us the opportunity to work on this problem.

Any message either sent to or from a\nclient or server will communicate in cells, each of which is a \ufb01xed length (currently\n512 bytes); any message longer than this is broken up into multiple cells.\nCircuit: a series of Tor servers that transfer data for a client to a destination. Each server\nin the circuit has its own level of encryption so that no server can read the message\nexcept the last one.\nDirectory: the collection of information about servers that are available for use as Tor\nnodes.\nDirectory server: a server that keeps the directory information. These can be either\ntrusted (hard-coded into the client or speci\ufb01ed in the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le), or mirrored\non normal Tor servers.\nEntry Guard: a client or server can specify servers that it wants as its \ufb01rst node in its\ncircuits. These are entry guards.\nExit Server: the last server in a circuit. Clients can specify preferred exit servers.\nHidden Service: A service hosted anonymously using Tor. The IP of said service need\nnot be revealed to anyone accessing it. For more details, see appendix C.\nServer/Router/Hop/Node: a computer running Tor that is connected to the Tor cloud.\nServers have nicknames and should be known from the directory.\nTor Cloud: the set of servers running Tor. When a client or server builds a circuit, it is\nconnecting to the Tor cloud.\n\nB\nB.1\n\n(U) Programming details\n(U) Building circuits\n\n(U) The most important structure in Tor is the circuit, that is, the list of machines that\na client will send its tra\ufb03c through. Information regarding this circuit is maintained in\nthe circuit t structure. This structure stores information regarding the connections and\nencryption used by the machine when sending information along the circuit. For the client,\nit also contains a list of the servers along the path and the encryption information to use\nwith each server.\n(U) When a user wants to build a circuit, most of the work happens in the function circuit establish circuit. It is passed \ufb01ve parameters: purpose, need capacity,\nneed uptime, internal, and a pointer to info. These parameters contain information used to\ndetermine several aspects of the circuit that is ultimately built. In particular, info contains\n\n21\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ninformation for connecting to a speci\ufb01c exit server if one has already been chosen. (This\nonly happens when attempting to access one of Tor\u2019s hidden services; see appendix C\nbelow.) circuit establish circuit is a small function, consisting of only 20 lines. All\nof the real work happens in 4 function calls that it makes.\n(U) First, circuit establish circuit calls circuit init, to which it passes purpose, need uptime, need capacity, and internal. Right away, this function calls another\nfunction, circuit new. This function allocates memory for the circuit t structure, initializes several \ufb01elds of the structure, calls circuit add to add the new circuit to the\nglobal circuit list, and returns. Back in circuit init, the parameters are used to initialize more \ufb01elds in the circuit t structure. Next, it sets the state of the circuit to\nCIRCUIT STATE OR WAIT, indicating that it is waiting to establish a connection to the next\nserver in the path before it sends along any packets. Finally, circuit init returns a\npointer to the newly-created circuit t structure.\n(U) Back in circuit establish circuit, the function onion pick cpath exit is\ncalled and passed the pointer to the new circuit t from circuit init and the parameter\ninfo originally passed to circuit establish circuit. onion pick cpath exit starts\nby getting the list of available routers using the function router get routerlist. This\nrouter list is created using information obtained from the directory servers. The process\nis not covered in this paper; see section 8.4.\n(U) Next, the function new route len is called to determine the number of servers\nthat should be in the circuit. This number is based on the purpose of the circuit and\nwhether or not info is NULL, but for most Tor circuits, it will be three. After a number\nhas been decided on, the function count acceptable routers checks how many servers it\nthinks can route tra\ufb03c. If the number of acceptable routers is less than two, the function\nreturns failure, and no circuit is built. If the number of available routers is two or more,\nbut less then what was decided on, this becomes the length of the circuit.\n(U) One of two things can happen next. If info is not NULL, then the server with that\ninformation will be used as an exit, and the program moves on. Otherwise, the program\npicks a good exit server. This is done in the function choose good exit server, which\ntakes parameters purpose, dir (a router list), need uptime, need capacity, and is internal.\nThree of these are parameters originally sent to circuit establish circuit. There are\ntwo cases, based on the circuit\u2019s purpose. For general purpose circuits, if is internal is set\n(meaning the circuit is intended to be used to connect to a server within the Tor cloud,\nmost likely as a rendezvous point for a hidden service), then the exit server is chosen\nusing router choose random node (see Choosing a hop, section B.1.1). Otherwise,\nchoose good exit server general chooses the exit server. This function takes a list of\nall available exit servers, discards any that are currently unsuitable (for example, those\nservers that are listed as down), and selects from those remaining one that can handle the\nmost pending connections. It then returns the router information necessary to connect to\nthe selected server.\n(U) After initializing the circuit and picking out an exit, the other hops in the circuit\nmust be chosen. To do this, the program calls onion populate cpath. This function\nrepeatedly calls another function, onion extend cpath, until the whole circuit is built. In\n\n22\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nonion extend cpath, choose good entry server is called to select the \ufb01rst node in the\ncircuit. This takes the entire list of available servers, gets rid of those unsuitable (already\nchosen as the exit, listening on wrong port, etc.), and from the remainder, chooses a\nrandom node using router choose random node.\n(U) For the middle hop, choose good middle server is called. Essentially, this is\nthe same routine as choose good entry server except that it also excludes from the list\nof possible routers those that have already been chosen as other hops in the circuit.\n(U) For each hop along the circuit, once a good router is chosen, the choice is returned to the calling function. The router is then appended onto the circuit by calling onion append hop. This function \ufb01rst calls onion append to cpath which adds this\nrouter to the list of routers in the circuit. How does the program keep track of this list?\nOne of the elements of the circuit t structure is cpath, which is actually a pointer to a\ncrypt path t structure. All of the information necessary to connect to each router, including the IP address and cryptovariables between the two machines, can be found in this\nstructure, as well as a few simple bandwidth accounting \ufb01elds. cpath points to the \ufb01rst\nrouter in the circuit, but it also maintains next and prev members in the crypt path t\nstructure, which, unsurprisingly, point to the next and previous routers in the circuit,\nrespectively. It is important to note that not only is this a doubly linked list, but it is also\ncircular.\n(U) After all three routers in the circuit have been chosen and appended to the\ncircuit, the program returns all the way back to circuit establish circuit and moves\non to the next important step, establishing connections to all of the routers.\nB.1.1\n\n(U) Choosing a server\n\n(U) Most of the time, router choose random node is called to choose which server will be\nused. Despite its name, the choice is not exactly random, and the function is passed several\nparameters to help with its decision. The most important arguments would be the list of\npreferred servers, and the lists of excluded servers. For some reason, two lists of excluded\nservers are passed: a character string containing server nicknames, and a smartlist t\nstructure see below containing server information. The lists do not necessarily overlap.\nSeveral \ufb02ags indicating user preferences regarding server capacity, uptime, and the like are\nalso passed. One of the arguments, strict, is set if the user will only accept a choice from\ntheir list of preferred servers.\n(U) The function begins by creating a smartlist of the preferred servers, from which\nit removes any excluded servers. It will then call smartlist choose to select a random\nelement of that list.\n(TS//SI) smartlist choose is a very simple function. In Tor, the smartlist t\nstructure is essentially a resizable array, and several functions are provided to manage\nthem. (See appendix E, MJOLNIR API for more on smartlists.) smartlist choose\ngenerates a random index and returns the element of the smartlist with that index. The\nrandom index is generated using the OpenSSL RAND bytes function. Care is taken to\navoid bias in the random numbers, by making sure that the maximum value returned by\n\n23\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nRAND bytes is a multiple of the size of the smartlist. For example, suppose the size of\nthe array is 10 and RAND bytes could return any value up to 25. Then when computing a\nrandom index for the smartlist, the function would generate a value less than 25 and take\nit mod 10. Because 25 is not a multiple of 10, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 would occur\nmore often than 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n(U) If for some reason no preferred server is chosen (for instance, no preferred servers\nwere speci\ufb01ed), two things can happen. If strict is set, the function returns NULL, indicating failure. Otherwise, the program continues by attempting to \ufb01nd servers that meet the\npreferences indicated by the \ufb02ags. This is done by creating a smartlist containing all running routers that meet the preferences, which is passed to smartlist choose. The only exception\nis\nif\nthe\nparameter\nneed capacity\nis\nset,\nin\nwhich\ncase\nrouterlist sl choose by bandwidth is called, which makes its random choice slightly\ndi\ufb00erently.\n(U) routerlist sl choose by bandwidth works di\ufb00erently than smartlist choose.\nFor the given list of servers, it adds up all of the bandwidths. At the same time, it creates\na separate smartlist of each server\u2019s bandwidth. For example if the \ufb01rst three servers can\nhandle 200 bytes/s, 450 bytes/s, and 1000 bytes/s respectively, then the smartlist will have\nentries 200, 450, and 1000. Then, a random number between 0 and the total bandwidth\nis selected (using the same OpenSSL function as in smartlist choose). It steps through\nthe smartlist of bandwidths, summing the bandwidths, and chooses the \ufb01rst server where\nthe bandwidth sum is greater than the random number. Again returning to the example,\nif the random number was 412, the second server would be chosen, because 200 + 450 =\n650, and 650 > 412. If the number was 70, the \ufb01rst server would be chosen. We see that\nhigher bandwidth servers are more likely to be chosen than lower bandwidth servers, as\none would expect.\n(U) If the function is still unsuccessful in \ufb01nding an acceptable server, the program\ntries one more time to \ufb01nd a next hop, this time without setting any preferences. This is\nthe last resort; if no server can be found, then the function returns NULL and the circuit\nfails.\n\nB.2\n\n(U) Connecting the circuit\n\n(U) Recall that a client records all of the servers in its circuit using the crypt path t\nstructure. Once it has decided upon a complete circuit, the client must now connect the\nservers in the circuit so they can send information back and forth. In Tor, the connection t structure holds the information needed to set up such a connection, such as the\nIP address of the node it connects to, the port it should connect on, and a lot of other\ninformation. A connection is speci\ufb01ed by an id number. Connections and circuits are\nrelated in complex ways. A single connection may be part of several di\ufb00erent circuits, and\neach circuit t structure holds information on a previous and next connection (p conn and\nn conn, respectively).\n(U) After all the servers that will make up the circuit have been determined,\ncircuit establish circuit calls circuit handle first hop. First, this function re-\n\n24\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ntrieves information regarding the \ufb01rst server from the circuit\u2019s cpath variable. This information is used to see if there is already a connection to that server. If so, that connection\nwill be used for the circuit\u2019s n conn. The appropriate \ufb01elds of the circuit t structure\nare set to hold information about that connection, and circuit send next onion skin\nis called to set up the cryptovariables between the two routers. See B.3, Encryption for\nmore about the information sent in an \u201conion skin\u201d.\n(U) If there is no pre-existing connection to the \ufb01rst server, the function\nconnection or connect is called. It takes as arguments the address, port, and identity digest of the server being connected to. The identity digest is a SHA-1 hash of the\nserver\u2019s public RSA key, and is often used to uniquely identify a particular router. A lot\nof things happen in this function, with the ultimate goal of returning a fully initialized\nconnection. First, it calls connection new, which allocates memory for a new connection\nand initializes various members of the connection t structure.\n(U) Next, connection or connect calls connection or init conn from address,\nwhich is passed the newly created connection t structure, and the address, port, and\nidentity digest of the server being connected to. It tries to retrieve the server\u2019s information\nbased on its identity digest, which, if found, is used to \ufb01ll in more variables in n conn. If it\ncould not \ufb01nd the server information, then the function will \ufb01ll in the necessary information\nitself, occasionally using more generic information than would have been retrieved based\non the identity digest. With all of these things initialized, the function will return to\nconnection or connect.\n(U) The next important step is that connection connect is called. This attempts to\ncreate a non-blocking socket connected to the IP address:port combination it was passed.\nMost of what goes on in here is basic C socket calls. If successful, the connection is added\nto the global connection array, and read and write events for the connection are set up,\nusing libevent. The events on the connection are initially set to be non-reading and nonwriting, but as the program continues, the events will be changed to handle reads and\nwrites.\n(U) Finally, connection or connect will call connection or finished connecting,\nwhich will start the TLS handshake between the two servers. After the TLS handshake completes, the client will send a CREATE cell to set up encryption between itself and the \ufb01rst server. All of this will be discussed in the next section, Encryption.\nSo once connection or finished connecting returns, everything up to and including\ncircuit establish circuit returns.\n(U) At this point, the circuit is still not fully connected. The client has set up\nits connection to the \ufb01rst server, and is waiting for a CREATED cell in response to the\nCREATE cell it just sent. Once a CREATED cell is received, the client and the \ufb01rst\nserver have \ufb01nished agreeing on their cryptovariables, and can communicate freely under\na layer of encryption. At this point, the client will make an EXTEND cell, which contains\nall of the information necessary to connect to the second server in the circuit as well as\ncryptovariable information for the layer of encryption between the client and the second\nserver, and send it encrypted to the \ufb01rst server.\n(U) The \ufb01rst server will decrypt the cell, and read the information for connect-\n\n25\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ning to the second server. If there is already an existing connection between the two\nservers, that connection will be used for communication along this circuit. If not, then\nconnection or connect is called to open a connection between the two; see above. Once a\nconnection is open, the \ufb01rst server packages the cryptovariable information for the second\nhop in a CREATE cell and sends it to the second server. Upon receiving a CREATED\ncell from the second hop, the \ufb01rst server packages the necessary information into an EXTENDED cell, which it sends back to the client.\n(U) This whole process is repeated one more time, as the client sends an encrypted\nEXTEND cell through the \ufb01rst server to the second server, which will send a corresponding\nCREATE cell to the third server. Again, an EXTENDED cell gets sent back to the client\nafter the third server sends back a CREATED cell. Once the client has \ufb01nished setting up\nthe cryptovariables between itself and the third server, all of the connections in the circuit\nhave been made, and it is considered open. Any applications waiting to send packets\nthrough Tor are noti\ufb01ed that there is a new circuit available to use.\n\nB.3\n\n(U) Encryption\n\n(U) Tor packets are sent under several layers of encryption. Each connection between two\nmachines is under TLS encryption. Additionally, each Tor payload is encrypted by the\nclient once for each hop in the circuit, using a symmetric cipher.\n(U) In Tor, all information to set up the symmetric cipher between the client and\nthe servers in the circuit is sent in what is known as an \u201conion skin\u201d. In a basic Tor\ncircuit, three onion skins are sent from the client, one for each server in the circuit. Each\nserver reads its onion skin, sets up its cryptovariables, and sends back information to the\nclient to allow the two machines to share cryptovariables. In this way, the client gets the\nnecessary information to put its data under one layer of encryption for each server in the\ncircuit. All cells across a typical Tor circuit will be under three layers of encryption when\nit is sent, and each server will strip o\ufb00 one layer. See \ufb01gure B.3 for a visual representation\nof this process. It is these layers of encryption that give Tor its designation as an \u201cOnion\nRouting Network\u201d. The last server in the circuit will have the cell in the clear and be able\nto pass along the request found inside.\nB.3.1\n\n(U)TLS encryption\n\n(U) Tor\u2019s TLS handshake is carried out in 3 main phases.\nThe function\nconnection or finished connecting (see above, Connecting the circuit) calls\nconnection tls start handshake, which allocates memory for a new Tor TLS context\nand initializes several of its \ufb01elds, including the socket that will be written to and the\nSSL CTX that will be used for communication. The SSL CTX is initialized at Tor startup,\nand is changed every 2 hours. It is this structure that contains the certi\ufb01cates that are\nused during the TLS handshake, as well as the list of cipher suites to be used. Tor\u2019s certi\ufb01cates are discussed in more detail in section 5, Tor\u2019s X.509 certi\ufb01cates. By default,\nTor supports 2 cipher suites:\n\n26\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 2: (U//FOUO) Layers of encryption on a normal GET.\nTLS EDH RSA WITH DES 192 CBC3 SHA\nTLS DHE RSA WITH AES 128 CBC SHA (this is preferred)\n(U) Once the TLS context is properly initialized, the TLS handshake continues in\nconnection tls continue handshake, which calls tor tls handshake.\nThis calls\nSSL connect or SSL accept, depending on which side of the handshake this is on. Assuming there are no errors, the program moves on to connection tls finish handshake,\nwhich validates the handshake and extracts the identity key from the certi\ufb01cate. If everything checks out, then the server is considered authenticated and future communications\nwill take place under TLS encryption.\nB.3.2\n\n(U) Onion skins\n\n(U) After the client picks out its circuit and sets up a connection to the \ufb01rst server in the\ncircuit, it will send an onion skin to the \ufb01rst server. This is held in the payload of either\na CREATE or a CREATE FAST cell. What\u2019s the di\ufb00erence? When the client connects\nto the \ufb01rst server, it does so using TLS. This means that it has already authenticated the\n\ufb01rst server\u2019s identity and negotiated a key. This allows it to send a CREATE FAST cell,\nwhich does not require an RSA operation nor a Di\ufb03e-Hellman operation, since most of\nthe necessary information has already been established. Note that a CREATE FAST cell\ncan only be sent between a client and the \ufb01rst server in the path, because all other servers\nneed to be authenticated, and the client has no TLS connection directly to them. For this\nreason, CREATE cells are sent for all other servers in a circuit.\n(U) CREATE FAST cells are simple. The cell contains only a random X value,\ncreated using Tor\u2019s crypto rand function, which calls the OpenSSL function RAND bytes.\nThe client sends this to the \ufb01rst server in its circuit. When a server receives a CREATE FAST cell, it extracts the X value and calculates a random Y value using crypto rand.\n\n27\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nIt sends the Y value back in a CREATED FAST cell, along with a SHA-1 hash based on\nX|Y , where | denotes concatenation. X|Y is the shared secret and will be used to generate\nthe keys between the two machines. When the client receives the CREATED FAST cell, it\nwill perform the same hash based on X|Y that the \ufb01rst server should have and compare it\nto the value in the cell. If the two values agree, then the keys for communication between\nthe two machines are set up. (see Keys, below.)\n(U) An onion skin in a CREATE cell is more complex. The \ufb01rst 42 bytes are OAEP\npadding, the next 16 bytes are a symmetric key. This is done using OpenSSL calls. The\nlast 128 bytes of payload are the g x value for a Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake. The \ufb01rst 128\nbytes of this cell (which goes up to about halfway through the g x value) are encrypted\nusing the second server\u2019s public RSA key. The rest of the cell is encrypted with AES in\ncounter mode, using the symmetric key from the \ufb01rst half of the cell.\n(U) When a server receives a CREATE cell, it extracts g x , generates a random g y ,\ncomputes the shared secret g xy , and sends back a CREATED cell containing g y as well as\na SHA-1 hash based on g xy . If a machine other than the client gets a CREATED cell (e.g.\nthe \ufb01rst hop receives a CREATED cell from the second hop), it puts the information in\nan EXTENDED cell, and sends it to the client. When the client gets a CREATED cell or\nan EXTENDED cell, it calculates g xy and checks that the accompanying hash is correct.\nThe client uses g xy to set up the keys that will be used when it communicates with that\nnode. Note that this key exchange required expensive RSA and Di\ufb03e-Hellman operations,\nin contrast to the simple random number generation of the CREATE FAST exchange.\n(U) Keys (U) When a CREATED or CREATED FAST cell is received, the function\ncircuit finish handshake is called. It will extract the shared secret and use it to create\nkeys for communication. Recall that for a CREATED cell the shared secret is g xy , and for\na CREATED FAST cell the shared secret is X|Y . Denote the shared secret as K0 .\n(U) Regardless of which type of cell is received,\nthe function\ncrypto expand key material is passed the shared secret. It does a series of hashes to get\nK = H(K0 |[00])|H(K0 |[01])|H(K0 |[02])| ..., where | denotes concatenation. This should\nnot include more than 5 hashes (each hash is 20 bytes long). Any extra bytes are ignored.\n(U) The \ufb01rst 20 bytes of K form KH , the handshake digest. This is used to make\nsure the other node\u2019s handshake checks out. The next 20 bytes become Df , the forward\ndigest, and the next 20 bytes become Db , the backward digest. These digests are used for\nintegrity-checking purposes. They seed a hash that is used by machines to to determine\nwhether or not a cell has been decrypted all the way or not. Df is used for client to server\nstreams, and Db is used for server to client streams. The next 16 bytes of K become Kf ,\nand the next 16 bytes of K become Kb . Kf and Kb are the keys used to encrypt and\ndecrypt the streams of data between the two machines. Kf is used for client to server\nstreams, and Kb is used for server to client streams. All other bytes are discarded.\n\n28\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nC\nC.1\n\n(U) Hidden services\n(U) O\ufb00ering a hidden service\n\n(U) In order to o\ufb00er a hidden service, the operator of the service (whom we will call\nBob) must \ufb01rst add lines to their Tor con\ufb01guration \ufb01le indicating the directory containing\ninformation regarding the hidden service and the port on which the hidden service will\nbe advertised. After Tor starts up with this new con\ufb01guration \ufb01le, it will automatically\ngenerate an RSA public/private key pair, and create a .onion address for the service. The\naddress is of the form x.onion, where x is based on the service\u2019s public key. Speci\ufb01cally,\nx is the base-32 encoding of the \ufb01rst 80 bits of the SHA-1 hash of the public key.\n(U) At this point, Tor picks out at least 3 servers in the cloud to act as introduction\npoints. Bob may use the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le to specify particular servers that he wants to act\nas intro points, but if he does not, Tor will simply choose a servers randomly. Once the intro\npoints have been decided upon, Bob does two things. He will generate a service descriptor,\nwhich contains information about his public key and how to connect to his introduction\npoints. This service descriptor can be uploaded to the public directory servers, but it\nneed not be if Bob does not wish to have his service publicly known. Bob will also create\ncircuits to his introduction points. Once the circuit is connected, he will send along cells\nwhich contain his public key, a hash based on KH (see Keys, in B.3, Encryption), and\na signature based on that data. These are called RELAY ESTABLISH INTRO cells.\n(U) When an intended introduction point receives the RELAY ESTABLISH INTRO\ncell, it checks that the information is well-formed and correctly signed. If so, it sends a cell\nback to Bob acknowledging that it will act as an introduction point for his hidden service.\nIt also makes note that the circuit on which it received the RELAY ESTABLISH INTRO\ncell will be used when dealing with requests for Bob\u2019s hidden service, and associates it\nwith Bob\u2019s public key.\n(U) When Bob receives acknowledgment from his introduction points, he considers\nthe introduction circuits open, he will advertise his service descriptors to the Tor directory\nservers if he so desires, and he is now ready to receive requests to access the hidden service.\n\nC.2\n\n(U) Accessing a hidden service\n\n(U) There are several ways that a client (whom we will call Alice) can become aware of\nBob\u2019s hidden service. At the very least, she must receive Bob\u2019s public key somehow, most\nlikely through some out-of-band communication such as a phone conversation or encrypted\ne-mail. Using this, she can request Bob\u2019s service descriptor from the Tor directory servers\nif Bob has chosen to advertise his service publicly. Otherwise, Alice must know Bob\u2019s\nentire service descriptor through some other means.\n(U) Once Alice has the descriptor and decides to talk to Bob\u2019s hidden service, she\nmust \ufb01rst set up a circuit to some server in the Tor cloud, known as a rendezvous point\n(RP). This point is chosen randomly, although Alice can add a line to her Tor con\ufb01guration\n\ufb01le that will indicate preferred RPs. Once the circuit is established, Alice sends a RE-\n\n29\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nLAY ESTABLISH RENDEZVOUS cell to the RP, which contains a randomly generated\nnumber referred to as a rendezvous cookie (RC).\n(U) When the RP receives the RELAY ESTABLISH RENDEZVOUS cell, it will\nsend an acknowledgment back to Alice, and make note that the circuit the cell came in on\nis to be used for a rendezvous, and is associated with that RC.\n(U) After Alice receives acknowledgment from the RP, she builds a circuit to one of\nthe introduction points listed in Bob\u2019s service descriptor. Once connected, she will send\na RELAY INTRODUCE1 cell to the intro point, which contains a hash of Bob\u2019s public\nkey, as well as information intended for Bob that is encrypted to his public key. When\nthe introduction point sees the RELAY INTRODUCE1 cell, it checks the hash against the\nhashes of the hidden service public keys that it knows and \ufb01nds the circuit associated with\nthat public key. It then sends the cell (now encapsulated as a RELAY INTRODUCE2\ncell, with the same payload) down that circuit, to Bob. Afterward, it sends Alice acknowledgment that her cell was sent, and Alice will shut down her circuit to the introduction\npoint.\n(U) When Bob receives a RELAY INTRODUCE2 cell, he decrypts it and pulls out\nthe data Alice sent. This includes information for connecting to the RP, the RC, and\nAlice\u2019s half of a Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake, g x . If Bob decides to talk to Alice, he will\ncreate a circuit to the speci\ufb01ed RP. Bob sends the RP a RELAY RENDEZVOUS1 cell,\nwhich contains the RC, Bob\u2019s half of the Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake g y , and the KH for his\ninteraction with Alice.\n(U) When the RP receives a RELAY RENDEZVOUS1 cell, it \ufb01nds the circuit associated with the given RC. It then sends g y and KH in a RELAY RENDEZVOUS2 cell\ndown that circuit to Alice. It makes note of the fact that the circuit from Alice and the\ncircuit from Bob are linked, and zeroes out the RC so no one else can attempt to connect\nto Alice\u2019s circuit.\n(U) Finally, Alice receives the RELAY RENDEZVOUS2 cell and uses it to complete\nthe Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake and initialize the cryptovariables between her and Bob. Now\nAlice and Bob can talk across this newly-formed rendezvous circuit in almost the exact\nsame way as a normal circuit. Neither knows what is on the other side of the RP, so they\ndon\u2019t know where the other person\u2019s machine is located. The content of their messages is\nunder the normal circuit encryption as well as one more layer based on their shared secret.\n\nD\n\n(U) Information at the nodes\n\n(S//SI) It is possible for us to have a friendly computer in the Tor cloud. For example, we\ncan set up a server and advertise it to the Tor directory servers, like all other users. We\nmight compromise another server in the Tor cloud through other means. So how much do\nwe know about the tra\ufb03c that we are sending and receiving across circuits? Tor does a\ngood job of hiding information about the circuit from all of the nodes in the circuit, in\nmost cases allowing nodes to know only about the machines to which they are directly\nconnected. However, some information is still leaked simply by being a part of the circuit,\n\n30\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nand there are some instances where Tor gives the machines slightly more information than\nis needed. The following section attempts to provide a list of information known by each\nserver (here referred to as a node) along the circuit.\n\nD.1\n\n(U) First node\n\n(U) The \ufb01rst node in the circuit is the only node that knows the location of the machine\noriginating the request. It sets up a circuit t variable with a particular p circ id and\narranges a shared secret with the originating node. (See section B.3.2). When the client\nextends the circuit to the second node, the \ufb01rst node receives an EXTEND cell with the\naddress, port, and identity \ufb01ngerprint of the second node. It sets up a connection to the\nsecond node and sets n circ id in its circuit t variable with a new circuit ID. The second\nnode will send back a cell containing its half of a Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake (that is, g y ),\nand KH (see Keys in section B.3.2 for an explanation of KH ). After this, the \ufb01rst node\nshould not receive any cells that it will be able to recognize, because the cells will be\nencrypted. In short, the \ufb01rst node knows:\n\u2022 The location of the client that connected to it.\n\u2022 Cryptovariables used for communication with the client, which allow it to perform\none layer of encryption/decryption on cells to/from the client.\n\u2022 The ID of the circuit from which the client is sending information. This is p circ id\nin the \ufb01rst node\u2019s circuit t structure.\n\u2022 The location of the second node in the circuit.\n\u2022 The ID of the circuit on which it sends information to the second node. This is\nn circ id in the \ufb01rst node\u2019s circuit t structure, and will be di\ufb00erent from p circ id.\n\u2022 g y in the Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake between the client and the second node, and KH .\n(S//SI) However, a machine may not know that it is the entry node. If the commonName on the X.509 certi\ufb01cate passed during the TLS handshake is \u201cclient <identity>\u201d,\nthen it is de\ufb01nitely an entry node, because it is talking directly to the client. This is\nsu\ufb03cient, but not necessary. If the machine receives a CREATE FAST cell, then it is\nthe entry node, as clients will never send a CREATE FAST cell farther down the circuit.\nThere is an option in the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le that can be set so that a Tor client will never\nuse a CREATE FAST cell, and Tor servers will never use them, but this still appears to\nbe the most common way that the entry node is set up. Otherwise, a CREATE cell is\nused. If the node receives a CREATE cell, followed by an EXTEND cell, it may be the\nentry node. The only guarantee for such a pattern is that it is not the exit server, which\nwill never see an EXTEND cell.\n(TS//SI) This knowledge would be useless unless we can induce the client to pick\none of our machines as its entry node. In the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le, there is an option called\n\n31\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nEntryNodes, which is a comma-separated list of server nicknames. Any servers on that\nlist will be preferred when choosing an entry node. If the option StrictEntryNodes is true,\nthen only servers from that list can be chosen as entry nodes. If the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le can\nbe changed to have a client always use a friendly machine for an entry node, then we can\ndiscover who is using Tor, if not what they are requesting.\n\nD.2\n\n(U) Second node\n\n(U) The second node has the least information of any node in the circuit. It does not know\nwho or where the client is, nor does it know what or where the client is connecting to. It\ndoes know:\n\u2022 The location of the machine connected to it.\n\u2022 Cryptovariables used for communication with the client, which allow it to perform\none layer of encryption/decryption on cells to/from the client.\n\u2022 The ID of the circuit from which the \ufb01rst node is sending information. This is\np circ id in the second node\u2019s circuit t structure, and should be equal to n circ id\nin the \ufb01rst node\u2019s circuit t structure.\n\u2022 The location of the third node in the circuit.\n\u2022 The ID of the circuit on which it sends information to the third node. This is n circ id\nin the second node\u2019s circuit t structure, and will be di\ufb00erent from p circ id.\n\u2022 g y in the Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake between the client and the third node, and KH .\n(S//SI) A machine cannot de\ufb01nitely know that it is the second node in a circuit. If\nit receives a CREATE cell followed by an EXTEND cell on the same circuit, then there\nis a good chance it is the second node. However, this same pattern is possible for the \ufb01rst\nnode. Because \ufb01rst nodes often see CREATE FAST cells instead of CREATE cells, it is\nmore likely that if a machine sees such a pattern, it is the second node.\n(TS//SI) It is not possible to induce a client to pick our machine as a second node.\nThe second node is chosen using router choose random node, with no list of preferred\nnodes passed to it. The only possible way is to edit the client\u2019s con\ufb01guration \ufb01le so\nthat their list of excluded servers excludes all boxes except friendly ones, but that seems\nunrealistic, since that would probably entail listing hundreds of server nicknames in their\ncon\ufb01guration \ufb01le.\n\nD.3\n\n(U) Third node\n\n(U) The third node is the exit node for a basic Tor circuit. This means that it sees request\nthat the client makes in the clear, which is useful information. The downside is that the\nthird node has no idea who or where the client is. The exit node knows:\n\n32\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2022 The location of the machine connected to it.\n\u2022 The ID of the circuit from which the second node is sending information. This is\np circ id in the third node\u2019s circuit t structure, and should be equal to n circ id in\nthe second node\u2019s circuit t structure.\n\u2022 Cryptovariables shared with the client, which allows it to perform one layer of encryption/decryption on cells to/from the client.\n\u2022 The exit node can see the data the client is sending, such as an HTTP request or\nPOST data for a form.\n(S//SI) A machine can know it is the exit node very easily. There are several functions\nonly called by exit nodes, such as connection exit begin conn. There is even a macro,\nCONN IS EDGE that will return true if it is passed an exit connection (or an AP connection,\nwhich only appears at the client side of the circuit).\n(TS//SI) Similar to entry nodes, a client can set up preferred exit nodes in their\ntorrc \ufb01le. There is an option called ExitNodes that is a comma-separated list of server\nnicknames, and any servers on that list will be preferred when choosing an exit node. If\nthe option StrictExitNodes is true, then only nodes from that list can be chosen as exit\nnodes. So the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le can be changed to have a client always come to a friendly\nmachine for an exit server.\n(TS//SI) There is one other way to in\ufb02uence a client to choose a speci\ufb01c machine\nfor the exit. Servers have exit policies, which are lists of types of requests that a server\nwill handle. For example, by default, all servers reject tra\ufb03c sent to port 25 (SMTP) in\norder to discourage spammers from using Tor\u2019s network to hide their activities. One can\neven set up a server that will reject all exit tra\ufb03c, and only act as a \ufb01rst or second node.\nSo if we set up a server with a more permissive exit policy than most other machines, we\nwill be chosen more often to handle the sort of tra\ufb03c that other machines will not allow.\nFor example, if we were to allow connections to port 25, our server would be chosen to\nsend e-mail with higher probability than it would for sending other types of tra\ufb03c. We\nhave no speci\ufb01c statistics regarding common exit policies, and even if we o\ufb00er a certain\nexit policy, that doesn\u2019t mean that people will think to try to send such tra\ufb03c through\nTor. Still, this option is more attractive than altering a client con\ufb01guration \ufb01le, because\nit only requires a change on a machine that we own.\n\nD.4\n\n(U) Hidden service nodes\n\n(U) As covered in appendix C, Tor uses special nodes when accessing hidden services.\nD.4.1\n\n(U) Introduction points\n\n(U) The introduction point is the third node in a circuit that starts at the hidden service,\nso it knows the information listed under Third Node above. It is also, brie\ufb02y, the third\n\n33\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nnode in a circuit coming from the client, but this circuit is shut down as soon as the intro\npoint passes along the hidden service request. In addition, it knows the RSA public key\n(modulus) for the hidden service. This is more information than it needs, because when\nit receives a request to access the hidden service, all that is passed along is a SHA-1 hash\nof the public key, so all the introduction point really needs is that hash. By giving the\nintroduction point the entire public key, Tor is leaking more information than it needs\nto. Of course, the only thing that the public key really gets us is the ability to connect\nto the hidden service, but that is not insigni\ufb01cant. Consider the (small) probability that\na hidden service that we do not know about will select a friendly machine as one of its\nintroduction points, and the usefulness is clear.\n(S//SI) A machine knows that it is an introduction point as soon as it receives an\nESTABLISH INTRO cell, which contains the public key info.\n(TS//SI) The hidden service can select its introduction points in its con\ufb01guration\n\ufb01le through a \ufb01eld called HiddenServiceNodes. By changing that \ufb01eld, we can in\ufb02uence\nthe hidden service to choose our box as its introduction point, but if we are on their box\nalready, there are far more useful things we can do, like obtaining the hidden service\u2019s\nprivate key. If HiddenServiceNodes is empty, then introduction points are picked using\nrouter choose random node.\nD.4.2\n\n(U) Rendezvous points\n\n(TS//SI) Rendezvous points are the most knowledgeable nodes in a hidden service circuit.\nWhen accessing a hidden service, a client must \ufb01rst set up a circuit to a rendezvous point\n(RP). The RP is the third node in this circuit, so it knows all the information a third node\nknows; see above. In addition to this basic third node information, the rendezvous point is\nalso given a \u201crendezvous cookie\u201d, a random 20-byte number which the RP will use later.\nAfter this circuit is set up, the client requests access to the hidden service through the\nintroduction point (the RP sees none of this), and if the hidden service decides to allow\ncontact, it will set up a circuit to the RP. The RP is the third node in this circuit as well.\nThe hidden service sends a cell down this circuit that contains the rendezvous cookie, g y\nfor a Di\ufb03e-Hellman handshake between the hidden service and the client, and KH . Right\nnow, the RP only looks at the rendezvous cookie, but it would require only a trivial change\nto have it store the other values.\n(TS//SI) At the RP, after it decrypts its layer of encryption, the cell is only under\none layer of encryption, based on the shared secret between the hidden service and the\nclient. We can also see g y . This is a far cry from knowing the shared secret, but this is as\nclose to being able to see tra\ufb03c between the client and hidden service as we can get right\nnow. It is certainly the weakest point of the entire hidden service system.\n(S//SI) A node knows that it is a rendezvous point as soon as it receives a RELAY ESTABLISH RENDEZVOUS cell, which contains the rendezvous cookie, and it\nknows that the hidden service and client are connected across it as soon as it receives a RELAY RENDEZVOUS1 cell from the hidden service and sends a RELAY RENDEZVOUS2\ncell to the client.\n\n34\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(S//SI) Clients can be induced to choose a particular machine as a rendezvous point\nby changing the \ufb01eld RendNodes in their con\ufb01guration \ufb01le. If this \ufb01eld is empty, the\nRP will be chosen using router choose random node. Hidden services will connect to\nwhatever rendezvous point the client tells them to, even if that node is normally on their\nlist of excluded nodes, assuming that it decides to communicate with the client.\n\nE\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR API\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR attempts to make accessing Tor functionality simple. Below is an\nAPI describing the most useful functions of MJOLNIR, arranged by topic.\n\nE.1\n\n(U) Initialization\n\n\u2022 (U) int tor init (void)\n\u2013 Description: This is the main entry point for the Tor client. It must be\ncalled before any Tor services are used.\n\u2013 Arguments: None.\n\u2013 Return Value: Return 0 on success; return a negative value on failure.\n\u2013 Notes: This must be called before any other Tor functions are used. It can\nbe called multiple times without issue.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int init keys (const smartlist t *subject, const smartlist t *issuer)\n\u2013 Description: In addition to important crypto initialization, init keys generates X.509 certi\ufb01cates (through internal functions), which the program will\nuse to communicate with the Tor cloud.\n\u2013 Arguments: The subject and issuer smartlists. See the documentation in\nthe section on smartlists and certi\ufb01cates.\n\u2013 Return Value: Return 0 on success and negative values on failure.\n\u2013 Notes: This function must be called in order for the Tor client to have speci\ufb01c\ncerti\ufb01cates. If no commonName \ufb01eld-value pair is passed in, it will generate\na random commonName (10-20 characters long). See the documentation for\nsubject and issuer smartlists.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) routerstatus t *set chosen dirserver (const char *nickname, int\nfascistfirewall)\n\u2013 Description: Call this with the nickname of any directory server, and then\nwhenever MJOLNIR needs to fetch something, it will use that directory.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n\n35\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n1. nickname: the nickname of the chosen directory server. If it is NULL or not\nthe nickname for any valid server, the dirserver will be chosen randomly.\n2. fascist\ufb01rewall : set to 1 if MJOLNIR is behind a \ufb01rewall that will not let\ncertain ports out. See Tor\u2019s man page for more documentation.\n\u2013 Return Value: The routerstatus t structure describing the chosen directory\nserver. The return value should be checked to see if it is NULL , indicating an\nerror.\n\u2013 Notes: The nickname should be either a trusted directory server (hard-coded\ninto the library) or a directory mirror. In order to download from a mirror,\nMJOLNIR must \ufb01rst know which servers are mirrors, so it will have to make\nat least one request from an authoritative directory.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int update router descriptors (void)\n\u2013 Description: Get the router descriptor data from a directory server.\n\u2013 Arguments: None.\n\u2013 Return Value: 0 on success; negative on failure.\n\u2013 Notes: This function must be called every time the program needs to update\nits listing of routers. This must be done at least once before setting up any\ncircuits. It may be done an arbitrarily large number of times throughout the\nlife of the program, but each fetch will generate a sizable amount of tra\ufb03c to\none directory server.\nWarning : this function will always talk to one of the 5 directory servers hardcoded into config.c:529 (add default trusted dirservers). This behavior\nshould be able to be changed if the chosen directory server is a directory mirror.\nSee documentation for set chosen dirserver.\nWarning : This function is blocking. It will halt program execution until it\neither times out or receives a response. See the timeout documentation.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) char *get routerdesc string (void)\n\u2013 Description: Return the exact string that the server returns when MJOLNIR\nasks for the directory.\n\u2013 Arguments: None.\n\u2013 Return Value: A new copy of a string containing all router descriptors as\nreceived from the directory.\n\u2013 Notes:\n\u2022 (U) routerlist t\nThe de\ufb01nition of routerlist t is in or.h on lines 930-941. The most important \ufb01eld\nis the smartlist routers which is a smartlist of routerinfo t structures. The one part\n\n36\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof these that will be used most often is probably the nickname \ufb01eld. Let us assume\nthere is a routerlist named rlist. There are rlist->routers->num used routers\navailable, and to access their nicknames, use rlist->routers->list[i]->nickname.\nAlso see the documentation of SMARTLIST FOREACH.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) routerinfo t\nThe function router get routerlist returns a smartlist of routerinfo t structures\n(see above for more details). The most important \ufb01elds of routerinfo t are nickname and the extend info. Using this library, the programmer should never have to\ndeal directly with the internals of extend info t, and will probably never see it at\nall, but if the programmer want to add to the library, he will need to look over how\nit is used. The best place for a quick example is any of the attack functions detailed\nin controlmod.c.\n\u2022 (U) routerlist t *router get routerlist(void)\n\u2013 Description: Return the current list of all known routers.\n\u2013 Arguments: None.\n\u2013 Return Value: The list of all known routers. This list will not be populated\nuntil update router descriptors has run.\n\u2013 Notes: See the routerlist t documentation.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) void tor cleanup(void)\n\u2013 Description: Cleans up before shutting Tor down.\n\u2013 Arguments: None.\n\u2013 Return Value: None.\n\u2013 Notes: This must not be called unless no more Tor connections or services\nare needed. Calling tor init after calling this function does not work yet. It\nseems that the problem with this is actually in shutting down and resetting the\nOpenSSL library.\n\nE.2\n\n(S//SI) Circuit building\n\n\u2022 (U) circuit t\nThe only \ufb01eld from this structure that the programmer needs to worry about is\nglobal identi\ufb01er. This identi\ufb01er is how the program keeps track of circuits it has\nbuilt, so if a program wants to have multiple circuits up at once, the programmer\nmust keep track of their respective global identi\ufb01ers or maintain a list of pointers to\nthe actual structures.\n\u2022 (TS//SI)\ncircuit t *new arbitrary circuit by nickname (char *\nbegin router nickname)\n\n37\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2013 Description: Begin a new circuit that can be added to at any time so long\nas the following two conditions are met:\n1. The client is not one of the nodes in the circuit.\n2. The same node is not used twice in a row. (It can, however, be used twice\nin the same circuit.)\nNote that the \ufb01rst of these is not checked in code, but in its current state, a\nclient using this library will never be a server, so this will not be an issue.\n\u2013 Arguments:\nnew circuit.\n\nbegin router nickname: The nickname of the \ufb01rst hop in the\n\n\u2013 Return Value: A pointer to the new circuit.\n\u2013 Notes: This function must be called before attempting to append a new hop\nonto a circuit.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int append router by nickname to circuit by id (char *nickname,\nint circ id)\n\u2013 Description: This function appends the router with the given nickname to\nthe given circuit. It looks up the circuit by its global identi\ufb01er.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. nickname: The nickname of the next hop in the circuit.\n2. circ id : The global identi\ufb01er of the circuit.\n\u2013 Return Value: 0 on success; negative values on failure.\n\u2013 Notes:\nMust get the circuit id from a circuit returned by\nnew arbitrary circuit by nickname. If MJOLNIR tries to connect to an\ninvalid router (e.g. if the router is down), the circuit will close.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int append router by nickname to circuit (char *nickname, circuit t\n*circ)\n\u2013 Description: Append router with the given nickname to the given circuit.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. nickname: The nickname of the next hop in the circuit.\n2. circ: The circuit to which MJOLNIR should append a router.\n\u2013 Return Value: 0 on success; negative values on failure.\n\n38\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2013 Notes: Must get the circuit from new arbitrary circuit by nickname.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) routerinfo t *get random router (routerinfo t *exclude)\n\u2013 Description: This function gets a random router from the global router list\nso long as the chosen router is not the excluded one.\n\u2013 Arguments: exclude: Gives the programmer the option to exclude a certain\nrouter. It is most useful to exclude the most recently appended router in the\ncircuit, as the circuit dies if it tries to go to the same router twice in a row.\n\u2013 Return Value: Returns the routerinfo t for the chosen router. This is\nprobably only useful for extending the current attacks, in which case it would\nbe useful to study those attacks carefully.\n\u2013 Notes:\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int nickname is known (const char *nickname)\n\u2013 Description: This function checks to see that the nickname is a valid one.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n\nnickname: a string with the nickname of some router.\n\n\u2013 Return Value: Returns 1 if the router is valid; returns 0 otherwise. The\nrouter is valid if the program has routerstatus t information about the router\nwith that nickname.\n\u2013 Notes: The program may know about an invalid router. For example, the\nrouter may have been taken down since the router descriptor was fetched. However, when MJOLNIR tries to connect a circuit, it will fail.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) void close circuit(circuit t **circ)\n\u2013 Description: Given an open circuit, close it, remove it from global circuitlist,\nand de-allocate its memory. circ is NULL on return.\n\u2013 Arguments: circ: The circuit to be closed.\n\u2013 Return Value: None. However, circ is NULL so it can no longer be used.\n\u2013 Notes:\n\nE.3\n\n(U//FOUO) Sending and receiving data\n\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int send payload down circ(char *payload, size t payload len char\n*ip addr, int port, circuit t *circ, int force)\n\u2013 Description: This function sends a custom packet down the requested circuit\nto the speci\ufb01ed address at the speci\ufb01ed port.\n39\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. payload : the custom payload, e.g. an HTTP GET request.\n2. payload len: length of the payload.\n3. ip addr : the IP address of the ultimate destination in IPv4 form: 192.168.1.1\n(as a string).\n4. port: the destination port.\n5. circ: the circuit across which to send this packet.\n6. force: if true, the function will always try to send a payload. If false, it will\ncheck that the address is reachable with the current exit, and if it is not, it\nwill not send a payload.\n\u2013 Return Value: Return 0 on success; negative values on failure. If it refuses\nto send a packet because it was not forced, it returns failure.\n\u2013 Notes: It is up to the calling program to check that both the payload and\nIP address:port are valid before calling this function. The payload read handler\nmust be set before this call is made.\nWarning : This call will block program execution until it times out or receives\na response.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) payload read handler (function pointer):\nvoid * (*payload read handler) (const char *, int)\n\u2013 Description: Function pointer to a user-de\ufb01ned function that gets called\nwhen the client receives a payload in response to its request.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. const char *: the payload that the client receives in response to its request (what the calling program actually wants to read).\n2. int: length of the payload.\n\u2013 Return Value: Must return a void *, so the return value can be anything\nthe programmer wants.\n\u2013 Notes: These functions should be de\ufb01ned by the user. To set this variable, call\nset payload read handler (handler). Example functions (print payload\nand do nothing) are given in torm.c.\n(TS//SI) Timeouts. MJOLNIR times out if it does not receive a response in a\ncertain amount of time. On the test LAN, we have it set to .1 s, which is more\nthan enough time. However, due to the slow nature of the Tor cloud, it may be\nnecessary to change the value of the initial timeout estimate. Our timeout follows the TCP-style timeout rules, so once it has started receiving cells, it should\nadjust the timeout on its own. The constants that may need adjusting are in\ntimeout.c. In particular, look at INITIAL EST SEC and INITIAL EST USEC for\nthe number of seconds and microseconds, respectively, before it times out. See\nthe discussion in the section on sending and receiving data.\n\n40\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int router should reach addr (int addr, int port, routerinfo t\n*router)\n\u2013 Description: The function checks the router\u2019s exit policy and returns nonzero if the address is reachable and zero if the address is not reachable.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. addr : the address to reach, as an integer.\n2. port: the port to use at addr.\n3. router : the router to check.\n\u2013 Return Value: If addr:port is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\n\u2013 Notes:\n\u2022 (TS//SI) int router should reach addr string (char *ip addr, int port,\nrouterinfo t *router)\n\u2013 Description: This function checks the router\u2019s exit policy and returns nonzero if the address is reachable and zero if the address is not reachable.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. ip addr : the address to reach, as a string in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx form.\n2. port: the port to use at ip addr.\n3. router : the router to check.\n\u2013 Return Value: If the ip addr:port is reachable, it returns 1.

However, the programmer should never\nhave to deal with the internals directly. Instead, he should use smartlist create,\nsmartlist add, and SMARTLIST FOREACH. We use this to de\ufb01ne custom X.509 certi\ufb01cates; it is nearly ubiquitous in the rest of the Tor code.\n\u2022 (U) smartlist t *smartlist create (void)\n\u2013 Description: Allocate and return an empty smartlist.\n\u2013 Arguments: None.\n\u2013 Return Value: A pointer to the new smartlist.\n\u2013 Notes: Any smartlist the programmer wants to use must \ufb01rst be returned by\nthis function.\n\u2022 (U) void smartlist add (smartlist t *sl, void *element)\n\u2013 Description: Appends an element to the end of the list.\n\u2013 Arguments: sl is the smartlist that is receiving the element. It must have\nbeen returned by smartlist create.\n\u2013 Return Value: None.\n\u2013 Notes: Technically, a smartlist may contain pointers to di\ufb00erent kinds of objects, though this is highly unrecommended. Individual elements of the smartlist\nmay be accessed through its list, e.g. sl->list[i].\n\u2022 (U) void smartlist remove (smartlist t *sl, void *element)\n\u2013 Description: Removes the element from the list.\n\n42\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2013 Arguments: sl is the smartlist that is losing the element. sl must have been\nreturned by smartlist create.\n\u2013 Return Value: None.\n\u2013 Notes: Preserves the order of any elements before element, but elements after\nit may be rearranged.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) SMARTLIST FOREACH (smartlist, type, var, code)\n\u2013 Description: SMARTLIST FOREACH is a macro that will run code for every\nelement in a smartlist. All elements of the smartlist must be of the given type.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. smartlist: The smartlist over which MJOLNIR runs the code.\n2. type: The type of data held by the smartlist.\n3. var : The variable name by which the macro access the elements of the\nsmartlist. The variable does not need to be declared before being used.\n4. code: The code to be executed. If there is more than one statement, it\nshould be in curly braces.\n\u2013 Return Value: None.\n\u2013 Notes: Remember that this is a macro. If the code is bracketed, it must be\nfollowed the closing brace with a right parenthesis and semicolon.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) \ufb01eld value pair t\n(TS//SI) This is a very simple structure containing two strings: a \ufb01eld and a value.\nThese should be allocated and set as any other strings. In the example program, this\nstructure is added to a smartlist so that MJOLNIR can use custom X.509 certi\ufb01cates.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) Subject and issuer smartlists (smartlist t)\n(TS//SI) Tor uses self-signed X.509 certi\ufb01cates during its TLS handshake. By default, it sends only commonName (normally the client or server\u2019s nickname) and\norganizationName (normally the string \u201cTOR\u201d) for both subject and issuer, with\nthe only di\ufb00erence being that the issuer common name is followed by the string\n\u2019<identity>\u2019.\n(TS//SI) A Tor server will check for required X.509 \ufb01elds, but not anything else\nexcept the subject\u2019s commonName, and the only restrictions are that the length is\ngreater than 0 and it consists of alphanumeric characters. (The commonName can\nalso contain a period, but this creates a log message on the other server. Currently,\nMJOLNIR treats the period as an illegal character.) These lists allow the programmer to send any X.509 certi\ufb01cate he wishes, instead of always sending the same ones.\nIf there is no commonName in the subject section, the client will generate a random\nstring of characters 10-20 bytes long to act as the commonName.\n\n43\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(TS//SI) If the commonName has an illegal character, MJOLNIR will generate a\nrandom one. If MJOLNIR receives as input an invalid X.509 \ufb01eld, it will ignore that\n\ufb01eld/value pair entirely. In this way, MJOLNIR provides relatively robust X.509\ncerti\ufb01cate generation.\n(TS//SI) The programmer must create two smartlists of \ufb01eld value pair t structures (one each for subject and issuer) where the \ufb01eld variable is the name of the\n\ufb01eld in the certi\ufb01cate and value is set to the appropriate string. These two smartlists\nmust then be passed to init keys (subject \ufb01rst, issuer second).\n(TS//SI) See the documentation for smartlist t, \ufb01eld value pair t, smartlist add,\nsmartlist create, and init keys.\n\nE.5\n\n(TS//SI) DoS-style attacks\n\n(TS//SI) The purpose of these attacks is not actual DoS per se. These simply do not\ngenerate enough tra\ufb03c. However, they may be able to generate su\ufb03cient tra\ufb03c to force a\nnode into hibernation, which takes the server out of the Tor cloud until the next hibernation\nperiod begins (could be a day, week, or month).\n\u2022 (TS//SI) circuit t *flower attack one router (char *routernick, int num petals)\n\u2013 Description: Set up a (D)DoS network attack on one Tor node. The program\nwill create a circuit consisting of random routers alternating with the given\nrouter. This results in the given router doing much more work than the rest of\nthe nodes on the circuit.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. routernick : the nickname of the router to attack.\n2. num petals: he number of times the attacked router will be in the resultant\ncircuit. Therefore, the circuit will be 2 * num petals long.\n\u2013 Return Value:\ncircuit.\n\nA pointer to the circuit t structure of the newly-formed\n\n\u2013 Notes: When setting up a circuit with n hops, the client must send n cells\nalong the circuit. So setting up a large circuit can be very time-consuming, as\nwell as expensive with regards to both tra\ufb03c generated and CPU time used.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established. For even a moderately long circuit, this can\ntake a substantial amount of time.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) circuit t *append flower to circuit (char *routernick1,\nint num petals, circuit t *circ)\n\u2013 Description: Similar to append coil to circuit, this function appends a\n\ufb02ower to the end of the given circuit. Using this, MJOLNIR is anonymized by\nthe structure of the Tor cloud.\n44\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. routernick1 : The router in the middle of the \ufb02ower.\n2. num petals: The number of times the middle router appears in the \ufb02ower.\nSo the \ufb02ower will be 2 * num petals long.\n3. circ: The original circuit to append the new \ufb02ower to.\n\u2013 Return Value: The circuit with the \ufb02ower added.\n\u2013 Notes: See the \ufb02ower attack documentation.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) circuit t *coil attack two routers(char *routernick1,\nchar *routernick2, int num coils)\n\u2013 Description: Similar to the \ufb02ower attack, except that this function generates\na circuit that bounces back and forth between two nodes in the Tor cloud instead\nof targeting only one router.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. routernick1 : nickname of the \ufb01rst attacked router.\n2. routernick2 : nickname of the second attacked router; if MJOLNIR sends a\npayload down this circuit, the second router will be the \ufb01nal one.\n3. num coils: the number of times each router will appear in the circuit. So\nthe circuit is actually 2 * num coils long.\n\u2013 Return Value: A pointer to the newly-formed circuit.\n\u2013 Notes: See the notes under flower attack one router; the same applies\nhere.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established.\n\u2022 (TS//SI) circuit t *append coil to circuit (char *routernick1,\nchar *routernick2, int num coils, circuit t *circ)\n\u2013 Description: Similar to the coil attack, but puts the coil at the end of a\ngiven circuit. Using this, MJOLNIR is anonymized by the structure of the Tor\ncloud.\n\u2013 Arguments:\n1. routernick1 : the \ufb01rst router in the coil.\n2. routernick2 : the second router in the coil.\n3. num coils: The number of times each router appears in the coil. The\nresulting circuit will be as long as circ plus 2 * num coils.\n4. circ: The circuit to which MJOLNIR appends the coil.\n\u2013 Return Value: the newly-formed circuit.\n\n45\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\u2013 Notes: See the documentation for the coil attack.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\nF\nF.1\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR for Windows\n(U) Interface\n\n(TS//SI) The GUI provides the user with a list of all the circuits created by the client.\nThe list displays relevant information about each circuit, including its length, state, and\npurpose. Additionally, each circuit has an light icon next to its name. The light is red if\nthe circuit is closed (cannot be used). The light is green if the circuit is open and ready\nfor use. Beneath the circuit list, a list of the servers in a circuit is displayed for the last\ncircuit clicked. Similar to the circuits, the servers each have a light next to their names to\nindicate whether the circuit is open up to that server. The displays for the circuit list and\nthe node list are set to update on a timer (currently set to three seconds.) On the right,\nthe GUI provides a list of servers that are available for use in a circuit. The router list\ndoes not update on the timer. To update the router list, the user must click the \u201cLoad\nRouters\u201d button.\n\nF.2\n\n(S//SI) Creating new circuits\n\n(TS//SI) The GUI provides a few di\ufb00erent ways to create new circuits. The most general\nway to create a new circuit is to click the \u201cNew Circuit\u201d button. This will create a\nnull circuit with a user-speci\ufb01ed name and purpose (see the Tor documentation for more\ninformation on circuit purpose.) The user can then proceed to build a circuit by appending\nservers individually to the end of the circuit. Alternatively, the user can create a random\ncircuit of arbitrary length by clicking the \u201cNew Random Circuit\u201d button. The user then\nspeci\ufb01es a name and length n, and MJOLNIR will choose n random servers from the\navailable router list and create a new circuit. Currently, all random circuits are made with\n\u201cGeneral\u201d purpose. Modifying the program so that the user can specify the purpose of a\nrandom circuit only requires a minor change at the library level. However, it is likely that\ncreating circuits of certain purposes will cause the program to crash (see below.) Circuits\ncan also be created using the coil or \ufb02ower attacks (see section 7.1, DoS-Style Attacks.)\n(TS//SI) To append a server to a circuit, the user must \ufb01rst select the desired circuit\nby clicking on its name in the circuit list. This causes the chosen circuit to become current,\nwhich means it is the circuit whose node list is currently displayed. Then the user rightclicks on the name of the desired server in the router list and selects \u201cAppend to Current\nCircuit.\u201d Any \u201cGeneral\u201d purpose circuit that is open can have a server appended to it.\n(TS//SI) It should be noted that circuits created with certain purposes cannot have\nservers appended to them, and trying to do so will crash the program. Currently, only\n\u201cGeneral\u201d, \u201cIntroducing\u201d, and \u201cEstablish Rend\u201d circuits are able to have servers appended\n\n46\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 3: (TS//SI) Appending a server to a pre-existing circuit.\nto them. Once a server is appended to an \u201cEstablish Rend\u201d circuit, its purpose becomes\n\u201cRend Ready\u201d (a one-hop circuit to a rendezvous point) and attempting to append any\nmore servers will cause a crash. This will need to be cleaned up as functionality for creating\nrendezvous circuits and accessing hidden services is added.\n\nF.3\n\n(TS//SI) DoS-style attacks\n\n(TS//SI) The GUI provides an interface for performing the coil and \ufb02ower DoS attacks\nfrom the MJOLNIR library. In the coil attack, the user chooses two servers to attack and\nthe number of coils in the circuit. Each server appears once in the circuit for each coil, so\nthe length of the circuit will be twice the number of coils. For the \ufb02ower attack, the user\nchooses a server to attack and the number of petals, where the number of petals is the\nnumber of times the selected server will appear in the circuit.\n(TS//SI) For both attacks, the user has the option to create the coil or \ufb02ower as a\nnew circuit or to append it to an existing circuit. However, appending coils or \ufb02owers is\nmore expensive than creating them as new circuits, and there is a signi\ufb01cant performance\nhit for appending large coils and \ufb02owers to circuits.\n\nF.4\n\n(TS//SI) Sending arbitrary packets\n\n(TS//SI) To send a packet through a circuit, the user \ufb01rst clicks the \u201cSend Packet\u201d button.\nThen the user selects a circuit to send the message through, and an IP address and port\nnumber to send the message to. The user has the option of entering the payload of the\npacket in either hex or ASCII. Upon clicking \u201cSend\u201d, the packet is encrypted with the\nappropriate layers of encryption and sent through the circuit. The exit server will then\nsend the decrypted packet to the selected IP address and destination port.\n\n47\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 4: (TS//SI) The coil attack dialog.\n\nFigure 5: (TS//SI) Sending a custom TCP packet using the MJOLNIR GUI.\n\n48\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nF.5\n\n(U) Future features\n\n\u2022 Customizing the certi\ufb01cates. This feature is currently available in the MJOLNIR\nlibrary, but needs an interface in the GUI.\n\u2022 Functionality for creating rendezvous circuits and accessing hidden services as it\nbecomes available in the library.\nF.5.1\n\n(U) Minor changes/bug \ufb01xes\n\n\u2022 Add a purpose \ufb01eld to the \u201cNew Random Circuit\u201d dialog box, and deal with issues\nthat arise from attempting to create circuits of certain purposes.\n\u2022 Address the crashes caused by appending servers to circuits of certain purposes either\nby refusing to allow such an action or \ufb01xing it at the library level.\n\n49\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\f",

We face\nworldwide threats that are expanding in scope and complexity. This Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 National Intelligence\nProgram (NIP) budget reflects hard choices to ensure critical national security requirements are addressed in the\nface of a reduced budget environment. We must be prepared to accept -- and manage -- reasonable risk.\n(U//FOUO) Keeping America safe by providing the finest intelligence support to our policymakers, military,\nlaw enforcement partners, and allies remains our highest priority. With the superb talent and ingenuity of our\nworkforce, the IC will continue to deploy the most technologically sophisticated and innovative intelligence\ncapabilities in the world. Through integration and efficiency, we will sustain responsive, insightful intelligence\nsupport.\n(S//NF) The FY 2013 NIP budget of $52.6 billion (including $4.9 billion for Overseas Contingency\nOperations (OCO)) and 107,035 positions supports the National Intelligence Strategy and advances our Nation\u2019s\nsecurity priorities. This budget represents a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 2.4 percent, below the FY 2012 enacted\nlevel; and it reduces personnel by 1,241 positions, or one percent. The request meets the fiscal demands laid out\nin the Budget Control Act by setting the IC on a path to reduce expenditures by $25 billion for ten years; with\nover $15 billion of that amount saved by FY 2017.\n\n(U) Developing a Balanced Intelligence Budget\n(S) The IC leadership worked as a corporate body to develop the budget. The team first drew on lessons learned\nfrom the drawdown in the 1990s, which left the IC with a distorted workforce that lacked sufficient mid-career\npersonnel and technical expertise. As a result of that drawdown, the IC reverted to extraordinary measures to\nrebuild and balance the workforce. Moreover, we deferred infrastructure recapitalization, resulting in obsolete\nfacilities, single point failures, and inadequate power, space, and cooling. We also delayed investment, reducing\nour ability to keep pace with technical advances to meet mission needs.\n(U) Second, we looked forward to determine how best to meet increasing mission requirements over the next\ndecade in a resource-constrained environment. The IC leadership weighed the relative merit of capabilities and\nlooked at dependencies across the components. In addition, we coordinated closely with the Defense and domestic\ndepartments to minimize disconnects and ensure balance.\n(S) At the outset, I determined that we would not take a proportional reduction from each IC program, but\nrather compare relative merits of programs. We carefully weighed cost and risk to understand both the short\nand long term impact of our actions. To maximize investments for the future, we focused reductions on lower\npriority capabilities; sought efficiencies and smarter ways to do business; and prudently accepted risk. Overall,\nthis budget is guided by the imperative to achieve the right balance against competing demands. Our guiding\nprinciples were to:\n\u2022 (U) Sustain a skilled workforce;\n\u2022 (U) Focus on further integration and collaboration;\n\u2022 (U) Bolster agile capabilities that support multiple missions;\n\u2022 (S) Enhance counterintelligence; and\n\u2022 (U) Protect key investment for the future.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n1\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n(U) Reductions\n(U) To the extent possible, we protected the activities highlighted above; but with the magnitude of the\nreduction, we could not avoid limited, targeted cuts to priority areas. The following are some activities reduced\nfrom the base budget plan:\n\u2022 (S//NF) Sustained Congressional Cuts. We sustain FY 2012 cuts to the CIA\u2019s Global Deployment Initiative\nand NRO\u2019s Integrated Ground Architecture.\n\u2022 (S) Workforce. We continue Congressional reductions to the government workforce; curtail plans for future\npersonnel growth, and take targeted reductions to baseline personnel where the risk can be managed.\nFurthermore, we reflect savings from a lower than projected civilian pay raise and continue to reduce our\nreliance on core contractors.\n\u2022 (TS//NF) Operations. We decrease collection, production, and hard copy media generation in the GEOINT\nsystem, slow SIGINT network exploitation and processing modernization; cut GDIP HUMINT, non-core\nMASINT, covert action programs, and some Specialized Reconnaissance Programs (SRP) operations;\nand streamline the ODNI business transformation activities. Furthermore, we discontinue or terminate\nsome lower-priority missions, such as de-orbiting the Baseline ONYX satellite and transferring funding\nresponsibility to the MIP for legacy satellites.\n\u2022 (S//TK//NF) Long-Term Investments. We are terminating an NRO compartmented project, delaying\nTOPAZ performance enhancements until the second generation of TOPAZ satellites; and reducing\ntechnology insertion opportunities in other satellites. In addition, we are delaying some SRP investments\nand terminating the Community\u2019s investment in a consolidated human resources information system.\n\u2022 (S//NF) Infrastructure. We reduce enterprise management activities; eliminate the IC Data Center;\ndownsize the IC Bethesda Campus; suspend some facility improvements; and delay the replacement of\naged facility components. As a result, we will continue to house some of the IC workforce in older and less\ncapable facilities that may not meet current antiterrorism/force protection requirements and we will accept\nsome degradation in the IC\u2019s facility condition index.\n\u2022 (S//NF) Information Technology. We reduce capital equipment replacement and recapitalization; decrease\nsupport for heritage systems; delay consolidation of older systems; and eliminate plans for additional backup\nsystems. These offsets prevent spending to sustain or improve legacy environments when our direction is\nto establish a new IT environment based on more centralized common services. Investments required to\nestablish a more efficient IC IT Enterprise are protected.\n(U) Investments\n(U) Although the budget is declining, the mission is not. Prioritizing our requirements was a key element to\nproduce a budget that meets customer needs, supports critical capabilities, addresses gaps, and helps to maintain\na strategic advantage. In the FY 2013 NIP budget, the IC makes targeted investments in:\n\u2022 (TS//SI//NF) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). We are bolstering our support for clandestine SIGINT\ncapabilities to collect against high priority targets, including foreign leadership targets. Also, we are\ninvesting in groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit\ninternet traffic.\n\u2022 (S//NF) Cybersecurity. As the cyber threat continues to grow, we sustain the budget for the Comprehensive\nNational Cybersecurity Initiative and begin construction of a second High Performance Computing Center\nat Fort Meade, Maryland to keep pace with cyber processing demands.\n2\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\u2022 (TS//NF) Counterintelligence (CI). To further safeguard our classified networks, we continue to strengthen\ninsider threat detection capabilities across the Community. In addition, we are investing in target\nsurveillance and offensive CI against key targets, such as China, Russia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and Cuba.\n\u2022 (S//TK//NF) Major System Acquisitions (MSA). We are sustaining the acquisition baseline and maintaining\nthe schedule for the MSAs that replace current capabilities. For example, the NRO is modernizing overhead\nSIGINT, geospatial, and communications major system acquisitions. To reduce reliance on the Tracking and\nData Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), the NRO begins investing in a special communications capability.\nAlso, launch requirements are fully funded.\n\u2022 (S//NF) Ballistic Missile Collection. We are pursuing an affordable MASINT solution for integrating,\nimproving, and sustaining coverage of and collection against North Korean, Iranian, Chinese, Russian,\nPakistani and other ballistic missiles threats.\n\u2022 (S//NF) Mission Focused Science & Technology (S&T). We continue investing in cutting edge S&T that\nenables new mission capabilities. We are tackling hard problems in quantum computing, biometrics, cyber,\nweapons of mass destruction, and large complex data sets.\n\n(U) Optimizing Our Efforts\n(U) To succeed, the IC must employ its resources judiciously. The need to integrate all elements of the IC\nis essential to identify opportunities as well as dangers. In FY 2011, the elimination of Usama Bin Ladin along\nwith 32 other high value targets is just one testament to IC collaboration. Our ability to rapidly respond to\nthe requirements of Operation Unified Endeavor, while simultaneously maintaining support for operations in\nAfghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, is another. We achieved this by reducing the cultural, technological and\npolicy barriers to sharing information, and exploring new strategies for integrating our intelligence efforts. The\nFY 2013 budget sustains the imperative of integration, and provides the framework and common solutions to\nfurther collaboration.\n(U) Focusing on Integration\n(U) The Office of the DNI has promoted information sharing and collaboration through the integration of\nanalysis and collection at the strategic level. This has improved mission management of key intelligence problems,\nleading to a sharper focus on, and encouragement of, integration within the Community. The heightened attention\non intelligence integration has changed the dynamics of intelligence activities. Without requiring individual IC\nelements to reorganize, the emphasis on integration has led Community elements to think and operate in ways\nthat are responsive to strategic management and direction that encourages, recognizes, and rewards integrated\nintelligence operations.\n(U//FOUO) The National Intelligence Managers (NIM) are the principal agents of mission integration. They\noversee and integrate all aspects of the IC\u2019s efforts against a particular regional or functional problem to provide a\nmore complete understanding of the associated issues. A major responsibility includes the development, planning,\nexecution, and oversight of Unifying Intelligence Strategies (UIS) for their individual accounts, with the principal\naim of managing the relevant policies, priorities, and relationships among the IC elements who participate in\neach of these target domains.\n(U//FOUO) These UIS are the instruments that are used to integrate IC efforts against critical priorities. Each\nUIS supports decision-making by outlining gaps and challenges, as well as opportunities that would most benefit\nfrom integration of IC efforts. In addition, the UIS present a select number of integration initiatives to provide\na holistic perspective across the strategies.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n3\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n(U) Promoting Information Sharing\n(U) Information sharing also is a critical enabler of integration across the Community. This budget begins to\nimplement a restructuring of the IC information technology (IT) architecture that will provide a strong backbone\nenabling greater IC integration, information sharing, and improved safeguarding of networks. The need for the\nIC to contribute to deficit reduction was the catalyst for achieving greater efficiencies in information technology.\nThe IC IT Enterprise will transform from agency-centric IT programs which are often duplicative and costly, to\ngreater centralization of common services for IC-wide use. Within this framework, we are leveraging existing\nefforts across the Community and sustaining unique approaches only when they are essential to the mission.\nFurthermore, we are investigating data management solutions and their associated security issues, such as the\nviability of comingling data in virtualized data stores to facilitate analytical integration of different data from\ndifferent sources and Agencies. This includes new management and operating practices for the secure storage and\nhandling of the varied information contained in different intelligence systems through the use of cloud computing.\n(U) Engaging Partners\n(U) Expanding the IC\u2019s culture of sharing with our partners is essential to leverage and maximize our collective\ncapabilities. We are strengthening relationships with federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners to fuse\ndomestic and foreign intelligence to quickly understand and act on threats. Through coordinated efforts, we can\noptimize our efforts to improve intelligence support.\n(U) As part of the Administration's overall foreign trade initiative, the IC will more closely coordinate its\nintelligence gathering and analysis efforts with federal agencies responsible for monitoring foreign trade barriers\nand enforcing U.S. trade rights under international trade agreements. The IC will directly support and strengthen\nU.S. interagency trade enforcement efforts to address unfair trade practices through the World Trade Organization\nand under other domestic and international trade enforcement authorities\n(U) Furthermore, the IC is postured to support the warfighter as the Department of Defense implements a new\nstrategy. The strategy is consistent with the IC approach to the FY 2013 budget. We will support the increased\nfocus on the Pacific region, and surge as needed for military operations. In addition, we expect there will be a\ngreater reliance on the IC to provide global coverage and warning of emerging threats.\n(U) Aligning Resources\n(U) This year, the IC implemented guiding principles to clarify responsibility for programming NIP resources.\n(S) The IC developed guidelines to more clearly delineate programming responsibility for the NIP and the\nMIP to further optimize resource allocation. These guidelines better align NIP and MIP resources with mission\nrequirements, reduce the number of split funded projects, and enable more efficient budget execution. The\nFY 2013 budget begins to implement the guidelines by transferring $165 million and 1,078 positions between\nthe NIP and MIP. This transfer maintains the mission, function, and execution of activities; it does not represent\ngrowth in either program.\n(S) In addition, the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) implemented a change in how it accounts\nfor resources that support the intelligence mission. Beginning in the FY 2013 budget, activities that predominately\nsupport departmental missions are funded outside the NIP. Under the new methodology, $11 million and\n44 positions are transferred out of the NIP.\n\n(U) Supporting Current Intelligence Operations\n(S//NF) In FY 2013, the IC will continue to provide crucial intelligence support to military operations in\nAfghanistan and to combat terrorism worldwide.\n(S//SI//NF) The request for Afghanistan and Pakistan decreases as support for the military\u2019s counterterrorism\nand counterinsurgency operations declines, coincident with planned troop reductions. Accordingly, this request\nsustains HUMINT and CI operations, along with the related analytic, processing, and exploitation capabilities.\n4\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\nAlso, NSA is augmenting SIGINT access and penetration, and Treasury enhances threat finance analysis to track\nterrorist and insurgent networks.\n(TS//NF) With the completion of the military drawdown in Iraq, intelligence support transitions to a smaller\nlong-term presence. The IC\u2019s request is significantly reduced from FY 2012 as our support focuses on providing\nforeign intelligence in support of diplomatic activities and monitoring Iraq\u2019s plans and intentions and those of its\nvolatile neighbor, Iran. This budget sustains HUMINT operations, with a smaller footprint, as well as SIGINT\ncollection capabilities. Most support for media exploitation, commercial imagery, and other operational enablers\nis eliminated.\n(TS//NF) The counterterrorism (CT) mission requires a global perspective to predict, penetrate, and preempt\nglobal threats to U.S. security. Therefore, the IC is sustaining operations, analytic, and enabling activities. With\nYemen, Somalia, and other Horn of Africa countries emerging as the most recent breeding ground for terrorism,\nthe IC is increasing efforts in those regions. Furthermore, we are sustaining CT capabilities in Libya to deny\nextremists a safe haven. In an effort to reduce our reliance on OCO as a funding vehicle, we transfer to the base\nsome enduring long term activities.\n(S//NF) The counterproliferation (CP) mission continues to support a variety of actions to deter, disrupt, and\nprevent proliferation. This includes improving our understanding of Pakistani nuclear weapons and dangerous\nnuclear material security; intelligence on proliferators, such as Iran and North Korea, to roll back and block\nweapons programs; increasing our ability to ascertain global chemical and biological threats; and better\nintegrating multidiscipline coverage of WMD targets such as chemical weapons in Libya and Syria.\n\n(U) Moving Forward\n(S//NF) Today\u2019s national security threats virtually defy rank-ordering. Capabilities, technologies, know-how,\ncommunications, and environmental forces are not confined by borders, and can trigger transnational disruptions\nwith astonishing speed. Never before has the IC been called upon to master such complexity and so many issues\nin such a resource-constrained environment. We are rising to the challenge by continuing to integrate the IC,\ncapitalize on new technologies, implement new efficiencies, and, as always, remaining vigilant 24/7 worldwide.\n(U//FOUO) The pressure to maintain the world\u2019s premier intelligence enterprise in the face of shrinking\nbudgets will be difficult. We will accept and manage risk, more so than we\u2019ve had to in the last decade.\n(U//FOUO) This NIP budget proposed is balanced and executable. It does not reflect the potential for a\nsequester in January 2013. Instead, the FY 2013 President\u2019s Budget proposes savings in other areas that exceed\nthe Joint Committee threshold, and as a result seeks to cancel the automatic reductions and restore the caps to\nthe original definitions in the Budget Control Act.\n(U) Intelligence is the first line of defense. This budget provides the programs and initiatives vital to our\nnational security. Our partnership with you -- our Congressional oversight committees -- is critical to our\ncollective success. With your continued support, the IC can continue to fulfill our mission to keep America and\nits interests secure.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n5\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\nFY 2013 Mission Objective Funding*\n$52.0 Billion\nCIARDS funding not included.\n\nIntegrate\nCounterintelligence\n7%\n\nEnhance\nCybersecurity\n8%\n\nCombat Violent\nExtremism\n33%\n\nProvide Strategic\nIntelligence and Warning\n39%\nCounter Weapons\nProliferation\n13%\n\n* MO6: Support to Current Operations is covered in other MO sections.\n\nFigure 1.\nThis Figure is SECRET//NOFORN\n\n116030_vol01_ill01.ai\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n9\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\nFY 2011 Intelligence Community Civilian Workforce\nGrade Distribution by Average Age\n30,000\n\n75\n\n60\n\n20,000\n45\n15,000\n30\n10,000\n\nNumber of Years\n\nNumber of Civilians\n\n25,000\n\n15\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\n0\nGrade\n6 Below\n\nGS 7-10 GS 11-12 GS 13-14\n\nGS-15\n\nAverage Age\n\nPayband Payband Payband Payband Payband\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nSES\n\nAverage Years of Service\n\nGrade by Years of Service\n100\n\n>35\n\nPercentage of Workforce\n\n31-34\n26-30\n\n80\n\n21-25\n16-20\n11-15\n\n60\n\n6-10\n1-5\n<1\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nGrade\n6 Below\n\nGS 7-10\n\nGS 11-12 GS 13-14\n\nGS 15\n\nPayband Payband Payband Payband Payband\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nSES\n\nNote: This chart contains data adjusted to facilitate display in whole percentages only and some categories with <0.50% will display as 0%.

The number of incidents in\neach category and a reference to the annex related to each incident category are contained in the body of the\nreport.\n(U//FOUO) As part of SID Oversight and Compliance\u2019s (SV) charge to provide comprehensive trends and\nanalysis information as it pertains to incidents of non-compliance, this Executive Summary provides analysis\nand evaluation of incidents reported throughout the current quarter to better address the \u201cwhys\u201d and \u201chows\u201d\nbehind NSAW SID\u2019s compliance posture.\n(U//FOUO) Section II, Metrics, has been broken down into several sub-sections: metrics and analysis of\nNSAW SID-reported incidents by authority, type, root cause, and organization. Also included is an assessment\nof how incidents were discovered (i.e., methods of discovery) for SID-reported incidents (see Figure 7).\n(U//FOUO) Significant Incidents of Non-compliance and Report Content follow in Sections III and IV,\nrespectively.\n(S//REL) Overall, the number of incidents reported during 1QCY12 increased by 11% as compared to the\nnumber of incidents reported during 4QCY11. This included a rise in the number of E.O. 12333 incidents, as\nwell as for incidents across all FISA authorities. The majority of incidents in all authorities were database\nquery incidents due to human error. Of note, S2 continued to be the NSAW SID organization with the largest\nnumber of reported incidents (89%), although S2 experienced an overall decrease in reported incidents.

From\n4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an overall increase in incidents of 11%. There was also an increase of 11% for\nboth E.O. 12333 and FISA incidents. The increase in incidents reported for 1QCY12 was due to an increase in\nthe number of reported Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) roamer 1 incidents, which may be\nattributed to an increase in Chinese travel to visit friends and family for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.\n(U//FOUO) Figure 1a: Table of the Number of NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Authority\n(U//FOUO)\n\nE.O. 12333\nFISA\nTOTAL\n\n2QCY11\n396\n150\n546\n\n3QCY11\n390\n198\n588\n\n4QCY11\n601\n176\n777\n\n1QCY12\n670\n195\n865\n(U//FOUO)\n\n(U//FOUO) Figure 1b: Line Graph of the Number of NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Authority\nU//FOUO\n800\n\nNumber of Incidents\n\n700\n600\n500\n400\n\nE.O. 12333\n\n300\n\nFISA\n\n200\n100\n0\n2QCY11\n\n3QCY11\n\n4QCY11\n\n1QCY12\n\nQuarter\n\nU//FOUO\n\n(TS//SI//NF) FISA Incidents: As reflected in Figures 1a-b, during 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total\nof 195 FISA incidents, 185 of which were associated with unintentional collection.

Figure 2 illustrates the most common root causes for incidents involving FISA authorities\nas determined by SV.\n\u2022\n\n63% (123) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to Operator Error as the root cause, and\ninvolved:\no Resources ( i.e., inaccurate or insufficient research information and/or workload issues (60);\no Lack of due diligence (i.e., failure to follow standard operating procedures) (39);\no Human error (21) which encompassed:\nBroad syntax (i.e., no or insufficient limiters / defeats / parameters) (12);\nTypographical error (6);\nQuery technique understood but not applied (2); and\nIncorrect option selected in tool (1); and\no Training and guidance (i.e., training issues) (3).\n\n(U//FOUO) The Resources root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of Operator Error\nincidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. Analysis identified that these incidents could be reduced if\nanalysts had more complete and consistent information available about selectors and/or targets at the time of\ntasking and if analysts consistently applied rules for conducting queries.\n\u2022\n\n37% (72) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to System Error as the root cause, and\ninvolved:\no System limitations (i.e., system lacks the capability to \u2018push\u2019 real-time travel data out to\nanalysts, system/device unable to detect changes in user) (67);\no System engineering (i.e., system/database developed without the appropriate oversight\nmeasures, data flow issues, etc.) (4); and,\no System disruptions (i.e., glitches, bugs, etc.) (1).\n\n(U//FOUO) The System Limitations root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of System\nError incidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. The largest number of incidents in the System Limitations\ncategory account for roamers where there was no previous indications of the planned travel. These incidents are\nlargely unpreventable. Consistent discovery through the Visitor Location Register (VLR) occurs every quarter\nand provides analysts with timely information to place selectors into candidate status or detask. Analysis\nidentified that these incidents could be reduced if analysts removed/detasked selectors more quickly upon\nlearning that the status of the selector had changed and more regularly monitored target activity. This analysis\nindicates that continued research on ways to exploit new technologies and researching the various aspects of\npersonal communications systems to include GSM, are an important step for NSA analysts to track the travel of\nvalid foreign targets.\n\nPage 3 of 13\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n(U//FOUO) Figure 2: 1QCY12 FISA Incidents \u2013 Root Causes\nU//FOUO\n\n11%\n\nOperator | Human Error (21)\n\n20%\n\nOperator | Due Diligence (39)\nOperator | Resources (60)\nOperator | Training (3)\n\n34%\n31%\n\nSystem | Disruptions (1)\nSystem | Engineering (4)\n\n2%\n\nSystem | Limitations (67)\n\n2%\n\nU//FOUO\n\nTotal: 195\n\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Delayed Detasking FISA Incidents: As reflected in Figures 1a-b, during\n1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 195 FISA incidents. 19 (10%) of the total FISA incidents were\nassociated with detasking delays.

When collection occurs with one or\nboth communicants inside the U.S., this constitutes inadvertent collection. From 4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an\nincrease of transit program incidents submitted from 7 to 27, due to the change in our methodology for reporting and\ncounting of these types of incidents.

Human Error accounted for the majority of all FISA Authorities database query incidents (74%).\n(U//FOUO) Roamers: Roaming incidents occur when valid foreign target selector(s) are active in the U.S.\nRoamer incidents continue to constitute the largest category of collection incidents across E.O. 12333 and FAA\nauthorities. Roamer incidents are largely unpreventable, even with good target awareness and traffic review,\nsince target travel activities are often unannounced and not easily predicted.\n(S//SI//NF) Other Inadvertent Collection: Other inadvertent collection incidents account for situations\nwhere targets were believed to be foreign but who later turn out to be U.S. persons and other incidents that do\nnot fit into the previously identified categories.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Database Queries: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 115\ndatabase query incidents across all Authorities, representing a 53% increase from 4QCY11.

(U) INTRODUCTION\n\nBackground\n(U//FOUO) On 4 October 2001, President George W. Bush issued a\nmemorandum entitled \"AUTHORIZATION FOR SPECIFIED\nELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES DURING A LIMITED\nPERIOD TO DETECT AND PREVENT ACTS OF TERRORISM\nWITHIN THE UNITED STATES.\" The memorandum was based on the\nPresident's determination that after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks\nin the United States, an extraordinary emergency existed for national\ndefense purposes.\n(TS//SV/ORINF) The 4 October 2001 Presidential authorization delegated\nauthority to the Secretary of Defense, who further delegated it to the\nDirector of National Securitv Agency/Chief. Central Securitv Service\n(DfRNSA/CHCSS} to conduct specified electronic surveillance on targets\nrelated to Afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days. Because the\nsurveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of\nthe United States, it would otherwise have required FISC authority.\n(TS//SI//ORINF) The Authorization specified that NSA could acquire the\ncontent and associated metadata of telephony and Internet communications\nfor which there was probable cause to believe that one of the\ncommunicants was in Afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged\nin or preparing for acts of international terrorism. In addition, NSA was\nauthorized to acquire telephony and Internet metadata 1 for communications\nwith at least one communicant outside the United States or for which no\ncommunicant was known to be a citizen of the United States. NSA was\nalso allowed to retain, process, analyze and disseminate intelligence from\nthe communications acquired under the authority. 2\n\n(U) This Report\n(U//FOUO) This report provides the classified results of the NSA Office of\nthe Inspector General (OIG) review of the President's Surveillance\nProgram (PSP) as mandated in the FISAAmendments Act (FAA) of2008.\nIt includes the facts necessary to describe from NSA's perspective:\n1\n2\n\n(U)Metadata is data that describes content, events, or networks associated with SIGINT targets.\n(U)The Authority changed over time. See Appendix B for details.\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLWI/COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nliJ\n\nestablishment of the PSP (Section One)\n\nliJ\n\nimplementation and product ofthe PSP (Section Two)\n\nliJ\n\naccess to legal reviews of the PSP and access to information about\nthe PSP (Section Three)\n\nliJ\n\ninteraction with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)\nand transition to court orders related to the PSP (Section Four)\n\nliJ\n\noversight of PSP activities at NSA (Section Five)\n\n(U) President's Surveillance Program Terminology\n(U//FOUO) For purposes of this report, the PSP, or \"the Program,\" refers\nto NSA activities conducted under the authority of the 4 October 2001\nmemorandum and subsequent renewals, hereafter known as \"the\nAuthorization.\" As mandated by the FAA, this review includes activities\nauthorized by the President between 11 September 2001 and 17 January\n2007 and those activities continued under FISC authority. This includes\nthe program described by the President in a\n17 December 2005 radio address as the Terrorist Surveillance Program,\nwhich was content collected under the Authorization.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n2\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nII.\n\nREVIEW CATEGORIES\n\n(U) ONE: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUTHORITY\n(UIIFOUO) Immediately after the attacks of 11 September 2001, NSA considered\nhow to work within existing SJGJNT authorities to counter the terrorist threat\nwithin the United States and adjusted SIGINT processes accordingly. Shortly\nthereafter, in response to a White House request, the Director ofNSA identified\nSIGINT collection gaps. The Counsel to the Vice President used this information\nto draft the Presidential authorization that established the PSP.\n\n(U) Actions Taken After 9/11\n(TS//SV/NF) On 14 September 2001, three days after terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States, General Hayden approved the targeting of terroristassociated foreign telephone numbers on communication links between the\nUnited States and foreign countries where terrorists were known to be\noperating. Only specified, pre-approved numbers were allowed to be\ntasked for collection against U.S.-originating links. He authorized this\ncollection at Special Collection Service and Foreign Satellite sites with\naccess to links between the United States and countries of interest,\nincluding Afghanistan. According to the Deputy General Counsel, General\nHayden determined by 26 September that any Afghan telephone number in\ncontact with a U.S. telephone number on or after 26 September was\npresumed to be of foreign intelligence value and could be disseminated to\nthe FBI.\n(TS//SV/NF) NSA OGC said General Hayden's action was a lawful\nexercise of his power under Executive Order (E.O.) 12333, United States\nIntelligence Activities, as amended. The targeting of communication links\nwith one end in the United States was a more aggressive use ofE.O. 12333\nauthority than that exercised by former Directors. General Hayden was\noperating in a unique environment in which it was a widely held belief that\nadditional terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were imminent. General Hayden\nsaid this was a \"tactical decision.\"\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n3\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U//FOUO) On 2 October 2001, General Hayden briefed the House\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) on this decision and\nlater informed members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(SSCI) by telephone. He had also informed DCI George Tenet.\n(TS) At the same time NSA was assessing collection gaps and increasing\nefforts against terrorist targets immediately after the 11 September attacks,\nit was responding to Department of Defense (DoD), Director of Central\nIntelligence Community Management Staff questions about its ability to\ncounter the new threat.\n\n(U) Need to Expand NSA Authority\n(U//FOUO) General Hayden said that soon after he told Mr. Tenet about\nNSA actions to counter the threat, Mr. Tenet shared the information with\nthe \"Oval Office.\" Mr. Tenet relayed that the Vice President wanted to\nknow ifNSA could be doing more. General Hayden replied that nothing\nelse could be done within existing NSA authorities. In a follow-up\ntelephone conversation, Mr. Tenet asked General Hayden what could be\ndone if he had additional authorities. General Hayden said that these\ndiscussions were not documented.\n\n(UI/FOUO) NSA Identifies S/GINT Collection Gaps\n(TS//SI//NF) To respond to the Vice President, General Hayden met with\nNSA personnel who were already working to identifY and fill SIGINT\ncollection gaps in light of the recent terrorist attacks. General Hayden\nstated that he met with personnel to identifY which additional authorities\nwould be operationally useful and technically feasible. In particular,\ndiscussions focused on how NSA might bridge the \"international gap.\" An\nNSA Technical Director described that gap in these terms:\n\"Here is NSA standing at the U.S. border looking outwardfor\nforeign threats. There is the FBI looking within the United\nStates for domestic threats. But no one was looking at the\nforeign threats coming into the United States. That was a\nhuge gap that NSA wanted to cover. \"\n\n(TSIISVINF) Possible Solutions. Among other things, NSA considered\n\nhow to tweak transit collection-the collection of communications\ntransiting through but not originating or terminating in the United States.\nNSA personnel also resurfaced a concept proposed in 1999 to address the\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n4\n\n\fTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nMillennium Threat. NSA proposed that it would perform contact chaining\non metadata it had collected. Analysts would chain through masked U.S.\ntelephone numbers to discover foreign connections to those numbers,\nwithout specifYing, even for analysts, the U.S. number involved. In\nDecember 1999, the Department of Justice (DoJ), Office ofintelligence\nPolicy Review (OIPR) told NSA that the proposal fell within one of the\nFISA definitions of electronic surveillance and, therefore, was not\npermissible when applied to metadata associated with presumed U.S.\npersons (i.e., U.S. telephone numbers not approved for targeting by the\nFISC).\n(TS//SI//NF) Collection gaps not adequately filled by FISA\nauthorized intercept. NSA determined that FISA authorization did not\nallow sufficient flexibility to counter the new terrorist threat. First, it\nbelieved that because of technological advances, the jurisdiction of the\nFISC went beyond the original intent of the statute. For example, most\ncommunications signals no longer flowed through radio signals si2:nals or\nvia phone svstems as they did in 1978 when the FISA was written. By\n2001, Internet communications were used worldwide, undersea cables\ncarried huge volumes of communications, and a large amount of the\nworld's communications passed through the United States. Because of\nlanguage used in the Act in 1978, NSA was required to obtain court orders\nto target email accounts used by non-U.S. persons outside the United States\nif it intended to intercept the communications at a webmail service within\nthe United States. Large numbers of terrorists were using such accounts in\n2001.\n(TS//SI//NF) Second, NSA believed that the FISA process was unable to\naccommodate the number of terrorist targets or the speed with which they\nchanged their communications. From the time NSA sent FISA requests to\nthe DoJ, OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average wait was\nbetween four and six weeks. Terrorists could have changed their telephone\nnumbers or internet addresses before NSA received FISC approval to target\nthem. NSA believed the large number of terrorist targets and their\nfrequently changing communications would have overwhelmed the\nexisting FISA process.\n(TS//511/NF) Emergency FISA provision not an option. NSA\ndetermined that even using emergency FISA court orders would not\nprovide the speed and flexibility needed to counter the terrorist threat.\nFirst, although the emergency authorization provision permitted 72 hours\nof surveillance without obtaining a court order, it did not-as many\nbelieved-allow the Government to undertake surveillance immediately.\nRather, the Attorney General had to ensure that emergency surveillance\nwould ultimately be acceptable to the FISC. He had to be certain the court\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n5\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINT/ ORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nwould grant a warrant before initiating emergency surveillance.\nAdditionally, before NSA surveillance requests were submitted to the\nAttorney General, they had to be reviewed by NSA intelligence officers,\nNSA attorneys, and Department of Justice attorneys. Each reviewer had to\nbe satisfied that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the\nnext review group, and each request was certified by a senior official in the\nDoD, usually the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. From the time NSA sent a\nrequest to Justice's OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average\nwait was between a day and a day and a half. In the existing threat\nenvironment with U.S. interests at risk, NSA deemed the wait too long.\n\n(U//FOUO) Early Efforts to Amend FISA\n(TSI/SI/INF) Given the limitations of FISA, there were early\nefforts to amend the statute. For example, shortly after 11\nSeptember, the HPSCI asked NSA for technical assistance\nin drafting a proposal to amend Section Ill of FISA that\nwould give the President the authority to conduct electronic\nsurveillances without a court order for the purpose of\nobtaining foreign intelligence information. On\n20 September 2001, the NSA General Counsel wrote to\nJudge Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the President, asking\nwhether the proposal had merit. We found no record of a\nresponse.\n(U/IFOUO) We could not determine why early efforts to\namend FISA were abandoned. Anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that government officials feared the public debate\nsurrounding any changes to FISA would compromise\nintelligence sources and methods.\n\n(U) NSA identifies S/GINT collection gaps to Vice President's Office.\n(TS//SI//NF) Because early discussions about expanding NSA's authority\nwere not documented, we do not have records of specific topics discussed\nor people who attended General Hayden's meetings with White House\nrepresentatives. General Hayden stated that after consulting with NSA\npersonnel, he described to the White House how NSA collection of\ncommunications on a wire inside the United States was constrained by the\nFISA statute. Specifically, NSA could not collect from a wire in the United\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n6\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nStates, without a court order, either content or metadata from\ncommunications links with either one or both ends in the United States.\nFurthermore, General Hayden pointed out that communications metadata\ndid not have the same level of constitutional protection as content and that\naccess to metadata of communications with one end in the United States\nwould significantly enhance NSA's analytic capabilities. General Hayden\nsuggested that the ability to collect communications with one end in the\nUnited States without a court order would increase NSA's speed and\nagility. General Hayden stated that after two additional meetings with the\nVice President, the Vice President asked him to work with his Counsel,\nDavid Addington.\n\n(U) Presidential Authorization Drafted and Signed\n(TS//SI//OR!NF) According to General Hayden, the Vice President's\nCounsel, David Addington, drafted the first Authorization. General\nHayden described himself as the \"subject matter expert\" but stated that no\nother NSA personnel participated in the drafting process, including the\nGeneral Counsel. He also said that Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrepresentatives were not involved in any of the discussions that he attended\nand he did not otherwise inform them.\n(TS//SV/NF) General Hayden said he was \"surprised with a small's'\"\nwhen the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, and that it only\nchanged the location from which NSA could collect communications.\nRules for minimizing U.S. person information still had to be followed.\n\n(U//FOUO) SIGINT Activity Authorized by the President\n(TS//SI//ORINF) On 4 October 2001, the President delegated authority\nthrough the Secretary of Defense to the Director ofNSA to conduct\nspecified electronic surveillance on targets related to Afghanistan and\ninternational terrorism for 30 days. Because the surveillance included wire\nand cable communications carried into or out of the United States, it would\notherwise have required FISC authority.\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) The Authorization allowed NSA to conduct four types\nof collection activity:\n\n[R] Telephony content\n[R] Internet content\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n7\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW/ICOMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n[RJ Telephony metadata\n[RJ Internet metadata\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA could collect the content and associated metadata of\ntelephony and Internet communications for which there was probable cause\nto believe that one of the communicants was in Afghanistan or that one.\ncommunicant was engaged in or preparing for acts of international\nterrorism. In addition, NSA was authorized to acquire telephony and\nInternet metadata for communications with at least one communicant\noutside the United States or for which no communicant was known to be a\ncitizen of the United States. NSA was also allowed to retain, process,\nanalyze and disseminate intelligence from the communications acquired\nunder the authority.\n\n(UIIFOUO) Subsequent Changes to the Authorization\n(TS//SV/NF) After the first Presidential authorization, the specific terms,\nwording, or interpretation of the renewals periodically changed. (See\nAppendix B for a completed listing of changes.)\n(TS//SV/NF) Domestic Collection. The wording of the first\nauthorization could have been interpreted to allow domestic content\ncollection where both communicants were located in the U.S. or were U.S.\npersons. General Hayden recalled that when the Counsel to the Vice\nPresident pointed this out, General Hayden told him that NSA would not\ncollect domestic communications because 1) NSA was a foreign intelligence\nagency, 2) NSA infrastructure did not support domestic collection, and 3) his\npersonal standard was so high that there would be no problem getting a\nFISC order for domestic collection.\n(TS//SV/NF) Afghanistan. In January 2002, after the Taliban was forced\nout of power, Afghanistan was no longer specifically identified in the\nAuthorization.\n(TS//SI//NF) Iraqi Intelligence Service. For a limited period of time\nsurrounding the 2003 invasion oflraq, the President authorized the use of\nPSP authority against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. On 28 March 2003,\nthe DCI determined that, based on then current intelligence, the Iraqi\nIntelligence service was engaged in terrorist activities and presented a\nthreat to U.S. interests in the United States and abroad. Through the\nDeputy DCI, Mr. Tenet received the President's concurrence that PSP\nauthorities could be used against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. NSA\nceased using the Authority for this purpose in March 2004.\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLWI/COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n8\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) TWO: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTHORITY AND\nRESULTING SIGINT PRODUCT\n(TS//SII/NF) General Hayden said that although he felt comfortable\nexercising the Presidential authorization and believed it to be legal, he\nrecognized that it was politically sensitive and controversial and would be\nsubjected to scrutiny at some point in time. He and NSA leadership strove\nto ensure that NSA personnel executed the terms of the Authorization with\ncare and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized.\nPSP-related operations began on 6 October. Early on, personnel worked\nunder the assumption that the Authorization was temporary and that\noperations would stop in the near future. After it became evident that the\nAuthority would be continuously renewed, management focused on\ndesigning processes and procedures for Program activity.\n\n(U//FOUO) Stand Up of Operations\n(TS//SV/NF) On 4 October 2001, after receiving the Authorization, General\nHayden informed the SIGINT Director and other key personnel ofNSA's\nnew authorities and asked the NSA General Counsel if the Authorization\nwas legal. The General Counsel said that the next day, 5 October, he told\nGeneral Hayden that he believed it was legal (see Appendix D).\n(TS//SV/OC/NF) Under General Hayden's direction, immediate steps were\ntaken to implement the temporary authority.\n\n00\n\nA 24-hour watch operation, the Metadata Analysis Center (MAC),\nwas created in the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID).\n\n00\n\nThe first Program Manager was identified and informed of his new\nresponsibilities.\n\n00\n\nA cadre of experienced operational personnel was chosen to\nimplement the Program.\n\n00\n\nOffice space was identified to accommodate newly assigned\npersonnel.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n9\n\n\fTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n00\n\nA new security compartment with the temporary cover term\nSTARBURST was established.3\n\n00\n\nFifty computer servers to store and process data acquired under the\nnew authority were ordered. 4\n\n00\n\nInitial funding of$25 million for PSP operations was obtained from\nthe DCI.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) On Saturday and Sunday, 6 and 7 October, small groups of\noperational personnel were called at home and asked to report to work for\nspecial PSP clearance briefings.\n(TS//SI//ORINF) On Monday, 8 October 2001, Columbus Day, General\nHayden briefed the analysts, programmers, and mathematicians that had\nbeen selected to implement the Authorization. At that briefing, General\nHayden said he did not share the specific content of the Authorization with\nattendees but relayed key information such as:\n\n00\n\nThe Authorization came from the President.\n\n00\n\nThe Authorization was temporary.\n\n00\n\nThe Authorization was intended to be an early warning system of\nimpending terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\n00\n\nThe NSA General Counsel had reviewed the Authorization and\nconcluded that it was legal.\n\n00\n\nNSA would do exactly what the Authorization stated and \"not one\nelectron or photon more.\"\n\n00\n\nThe Authorization should be kept secret and it required strict\ncompartmentation. Attendees had to sign a non-disclosure\nagreement.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden stated that after he briefed the attendees, he\nturned the briefing over to the General Counsel to discuss the terms of the\nAuthorization.\n3\n\n(TS//SI//NF) A pennanent cover tenn, STELLARWIND, was assigned to Program infonnation on 31 October\n2001.\n4\n(TS//SII/NF) Because of the heightened terrorist threat, at NSA's request, a vendor diverted a shipment of\nservers intended for other recipients to NSA, where they arrived under police escort on 13 October 2001.\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n10\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW/ICOMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U) Early Operations\n(TS//SI//NF) Within one week, approximately 90 NSA employees were\ncleared for access to the PSP. On 11 October 2001, the Associate General\nCounsel for Operations and the NSA Deputy General Counsel were cleared\nfor the Program and agreed with the NSA General Counsel's determination\nthat the Authorization was legal. NSA OGC did not formally document its\nopinions or legal rationale (see Appendix D).\n(TS//SI-STLW//NF) The MAC was created to analyze metadata obtained\nunder PSP authorization. By 7 October 2001, it was a 24-hour 7-day a\nweek watch center with 20 analysts, reporters, and software developers\nworking in three shifts. Many MAC employees were former Russian traffic\nanalysts with manual call chaining analysis experience. Initially, the MAC\nreported directly to General Hayden and the Deputy Director. The MAC\nChief briefed the Director every week, and the Deputy Director visited\nMAC spaces for a briefing each evening.\n(TS//SV/NF) While the MAC was setting up to analyze PSP metadata, the\nCounterterrorism (CT) Product Line was realigning to conduct PSP content\ntasking and analysis. The MAC and the CT Product Line worked closely\ntogether to coordinate efforts and share information. The CT Product Line\nwas growing rapidly as handpicked employees were moved to support the\nnew mission.\n(TS//SV/NF) Within 30 days, the PSP was fully operational. While\nawaiting delivery of requested computer servers, the FBI and CIA gave\nNSA lead telephone numbers, and the MAC was able to immediately chain\nwithin the United States with SIGINT collected overseas. Private sector\npartners began to send telephony and Internet content to NSA in October\n2001 . They began to send telephony and Internet metadata to NSA as early\nas November 2001 .\n\n(U//FOUO) On-Going Operations\n(TS//SV/NF) After operations began and it became evident that the\nAuthorization was likely to be renewed indefinitely, NSA management\nbecame increasingly focused on designing processes and procedures to\nimplement the Program effectively and to ensure compliance with the\nAuthorization.\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n11\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLWI/COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U) Organizational Structure\n(TS//SII/NF) NSA conducted all PSP analysis and reporting at its\nheadquarters at Ft. Meade, Maryland, within the SIGINT Directorate.\nSpecifically, tasking approvals, analysis, and reporting were conducted in\nthe CT Product Line within SID, Analysis and Production. Collection of\ndata was managed in SID, Directorate for Acquisition. No PSP activities\nwere managed at NSA field sites.\n[OIG will insert high level SJD org chart from 2001 here]\n(TS//SI//NF) Although the formal chain of command for SIGINT\noperations was through SID, in practice, the Director and Deputy Director\nofNSA/CSS managed the Program while keeping the SIGINT Director\ninformed. Over time, the SIGINT Director became more involved, but the\nDirector and Deputy Director always maintained direct operational control.\n(TS//SI//NF) Program Manager. Five officials held the Program\nManager position over the life of the PSP. 5 Initially, the Program Manager\nreported to the Chief of the CT Product Line. In 2004, the Program\nManager position was restructured as the SID Program Manager for CT\nSpecial Projects and elevated to report to the SIGINT Director. This\nallowed the Program Manager jurisdiction ofPSP elements across SID, not\njust those within the Directorate for Analysis and Production. At that time,\nthe position was also formally designated as a senior level civilian position.\nA small staff was added to form the Program Management Office.\n(TS//SI/INF) SID Analysis and Production. Initially, the MAC\nanalyzed PSP metadata (data that describes the content, events, or networks\nassociated with SIGINT targets), while SIGINT Development in the CT\nProduct Line analyzed non-PSP metadata. The CT Product Line performed\nPSP content analysis. SIGINT Development, a separate organization\nwithin the SID, managed approvals for content tasking. In 2004, the\nanalysis and production of metadata and content were consolidated into a\nnew organization called the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD). AAD\nwas divided into three teams: internet metadata, telephony metadata, and\ncontent.\n(TS//SI/INF) Coordination with FBI and CIA. By 2004, four FBI\nintegrees and two CIA integrees, operating under SIGINT authorities in\naccordance with written agreements, were co-located with NSA PSP-\n\n5\n\n(TS//SII/NF) The Chief of the CT Product Line was Acting Program Manager for a brief time in 2004.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n12\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLWI/COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\ncleared analysts. The purpose of co-locating these individuals was to\nimprove collaborative analytic efforts.\n(TS//SI//NF) SID Data Acquisition. Through the life of the Program,\ndata collection was managed by Special Source Operations in SID, Data\nAcquisition Directorate. Collection managers were responsible for putting\ntelephone numbers and email selectors on PSP-authorized collection by\nprivate sector companies and taking them off collection.\n\n(U) Metadata\n(TS//SI//NF) The authority to collect bulk telephony and Internet metadata\nsignificantly enhanced NSA's ability to identify activity that may have been\nterrorist-related. Contact chaining is the process of building a network\ngraph that models the communication (e-mail, telephony, etc.) patterns of\ntargeted entities (people, organizations, etc) and their associates from the\ncommunications sent or received by the targets. 6 Metadata is data that\ndescribes other data, specifically information that describes the content,\nevents or networks associated with SIGINT targets. For example, for an\nemail message, it would include the sender and recipient email addresses.\nIt does not contain the subject line or the text of the email; they are\nconsidered to be content. Likewise. for a telephone conversation. metadata\nwould include the called number and the callimr number as well as the\nduration ofthe call.\n(TS//SI//NF) Although NSA had the capability to collect bulk telephony\nand Internet metadata prior to the PSP, its application was limited because\nNSA did not have the authority to collect communications in which one\nend (the number being called or the recipient address of an e-mail) was in\nthe United States. PSP significantly increased the data available to NSA\nanalysts and allowed them to create more thorough contact chaining. This\ngave NSA the key to an early warning system-the ability to identify\nindividuals in the United States or individuals outside the U.S. using U.S .\ntelecommunications structures in contact with a foreign target, a terrorist.\n(TS//SI//NF) Because metadata was not constitutionally protected, NSA\ndid not consider it to be as sensitive as content collection. Nevertheless,\nprocesses were set up to document requests for metadata analysis and\njustifications for conducting such analysis under Program authority. The\n6\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Additional chaining can be perfonned on the associates' contacts to detennine patterns in\nthe way a network of targets may communicate. Additional degrees of separation from the initial target are\nreferred to as \"hops.\" For example a direct contact is one hop away from the target. A contact of the direct\ncontact would be described as being 2 hops away from the target. The resulting contact-graph is subsequently\nanalyzed for intelligence and to develop potential investigative leads.\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n13\n\n\fTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nfollowing describes the process used to obtain requests, conduct analysis,\nand report results under the PSP. (See Appendix E for a flowchart of the\nend-to-end process.)\n(TS//SII/NF) Requests for Information and Leads. Contact chaining\nanalysis requests were received from FBI, CIA, or NSA. Requests\ntypically took one of two forms, Requests for Information (RFI) and Leads.\nRFis were specific questions about a target's telephone numbers or email\naddresses, called \"selectors\" at NSA. Leads were more general requests\nabout a target's contacts. Requestors submitted leads to discover new\ninvestigative leads. Contact chaining requests were documented from the\ninception of the PSP.\n(TS//SII/OC/NF) Approvals to Chain. Prior to chaining, NSA\ncounterterrorism shift coordinators reviewed chaining requests to\ndetermine whether they met criteria provided by the OGC and based on the\nterms of the Authorization. They had to have enough information to\nidentify a terrorism nexus and demonstrate compliance with criteria\nrequired by the Authorization before analysis could begin. Shift\ncoordinators either approved requests, approved them for 1-hop (direct\ncontact) analysis, or denied them. Approved requests were passed to\nanalysts for contact chaining.\n(TS//SII/OC/NF) Analysis. NSA used a variety of tools to conduct\nmetadata analysis and view the results. NSA's primary tool for conducting\nmetadata analysis, for PSP and traditional SIGINT collection, was\nMAINWAY. MAINWAY was used for storage, contact chaining, and for\nanalyzing large volumes of global communications metadata. At the\nbeginning ofthe PSP, only the \"SIGINTNavigator\" tool was available to\nview MAINWAY output. Over time, new tools and new processes, such as\nautomated chaining alerting, were created to improve analysts' efficiency.\nTo obtain the most complete results, analysts used data collected under PSP\nand non-PSP authorities. Typically, they analyzed networks with two\ndegrees of separation (two hops) from the target. Analysts determined if\nresulting information was reportable.\n(TS//SII/OC/NF) In addition, an automated chaining alert process was\ncreated to alert analysts of new potentially reportable selectors. Previously\napproved selectors were compared to incoming MAINWAY data\nauthorized by the PSP, E.O. 12333, or the FISC. Alerts of direct contacts\nwith approved selectors were reported to NSA analysts for further analysis\nand potential reporting to FBI and CIA.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n14\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//NF) Storage. NSA stored metadata obtained under PSP\nauthorities in a protected database. Only cleared and trained analysts were\ngiven access to PSP metadata.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Reporting. Reports based on metadata analysis were\ntypically referred to as \"tippers.\" Tippers contained contact chaining\nanalysis results relevant to terrorism or with potential links to terrorism that\nwarranted the attention of the FBI or the CIA for further investigation.\nBefore releasing reports with U.S. person information, analysts obtained\npermission to do so in accordance with established NSA dissemination\nprocedures.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) For each published report, NSA retained documentation\nof the analysis, supporting RFI or lead information, and a justification\nstatement explaining the link to terrorism. If a report was not published,\ndocumentation was not retained. Counterterrorism personnel manually\nupdated information in a computer tracking system to reflect the\ndisposition of chaining requests.\n\n(U) Content\n(TS//SI//NF) Collection and analysis of content is NSA's traditional wav of\nreportin!! means of eoi'ldueting SIGINT. Content generally refers to words\nspoken during a telephone conversation or the written text of an email\nmessage. NSA collection of the content of telephony and Internet\ncommunications under the PSP improved its ability to produce intelligence\non terrorist-related activity. For example, by allowing NSA access to links\ncarrying communications with one end in the United States, NSA\nsignificantly increased its access to transiting foreign communications, i.e.,\nwith both communicants outside the United States. General Hayden\ndescribed this as \"the real gold of the Program.\" And, by allowing the\nintercept of international communications, NSA was able to identify threats\nwithin the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) From the start of the Program until January 2007, NSA issued\n490 reports based on PSP-derived content information. Also, as shown\nbelow, approximately 37,664 telephony and Internet selectors were tasked\nfor\nPSP-authorized content collection during that time period. Only 8 percent\nwere U.S. targets. The vast majority\n(92 percent) were foreign.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF)\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n15\n\n\fTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nApproximate Number of Selectors Targeted for PSP Content Collection\n4 Oct 2001 to 17 Jan 2007\n\n*\n\nForeign E-mail\n(19,000)\n\n(TS//SI//OC/NF)\n(TS//SV/NF) NSA leadership considered selectors for targets located in the\nUnited States to be extremely sensitive. As such, processes were set up to\nensure strict compliance with the terms of the Authorization. The\nfollowing describes the general process for tasking, collecting, storing and\nreporting telephony and Internet content under the PSP. (See Appendix F\nfor a flowchart of the end-to-end process.)\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) Tasking Approvals. Under the PSP, each domestic\nselector tasked for content collection was formally approved and tracked.\nAnalysts submitted content collection requests, also called tasking\npackages, to the Chief of CT for approval. Tasking packages contained a\nnarrative analysis, conclusion, supporting information, documentation, and\na checklist of package contents. In the Chief's absence, the Deputy Chief\nof CT or the Program Manager could approve the requests. The approving\nofficials reviewed the tasking packages to ensure that the proposed target\nand related metadata selectors met criteria in the Authorization. If criteria\nwere not met, the officials requested additional information or denied the\nrequest. In limited cases, collection was approved for specific time\nperiods. If the content contained foreign intelligence, the time period for\ncollection would be extended. If it did not, collection was stopped. All\napprovals were documented in tasking packages.\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n16\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//NF) Foreign selectors tasked for PSP content collection did not\nrequire formal approvals or tasking packages. Analysts were responsible\nfor determining whether a foreign selector met the criteria for forei2:n\nintelli2:ence tent1s of the Authorization.\n(TS//SI//NF) Collection. After a domestic selector was approved for PSP\ncontent collection, it was identified as \"tasked\" in the STELLARWIND\nAddresses Database by CT/AAD tasking managers who then emailed a\ncollection tasking request to the SSO Collection Manager for telephony\nand Internet content collection. Foreign selector content collection\nrequests were sent directly to the SSO Collection Manager. They did not\nrequire special approval.\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) SSO collection managers were responsible for\nensuring that telephony and Internet content selectors were put on or taken\noff collection. For telephony telephony content selectors, collection\nmanagers sent content collection tasking instructions to private sector\ncompanies. Private sector companies were responsible for implementing\ntasking at front-end devices to obtain the required content collection. For\nInternet content selectors, collection managers sent content tasking\ninstructions directly to equipment installed at\ncompany-controlled locations. Collected data was sent back to NSA/SSO\nand made available to analysts through the HYBRID voice processing\nsystem for telephony content selectors or the PINWALE database for\nInternet content selectors. SSO collection managers worked with private\nsector companies and the CT Product Line to ensure that collected data was\nas intended and legally authorized.\n(TS//SV/NF) Storage. Content (voice or dBata} collected under PSP was\nstored in protected partitions in existing NSA databases. Access to the\npartitions was restricted to PSP-cleared personnel.\n(TS//SI//NF) Reporting. After analyzing content data collected under\nPresidential authority and identifying foreign intelligence information,\ncounterterrorism analysts wrote reports. After an initial review within the\nCT Product Line, some reports were sent to SID Oversight and Compliance\n(O&C) for a second review for U.S. person identities. O&C reviewers\ndetermined whether the U.S. identities in the report were necessary to\nassess or understand the foreign intelligence information being reported..QL\nwas required with in the conduct of recipient's official duties . If an identity\nwas found to be unnecessary, it was not reported. Before any U.S. person\ninformation was disseminated in reporting, internal NSA approvals were\nobtained as required by United States Signals Intelligence Directive\nSPOO 18- Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures.\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n17\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) Initially, NSA responded to FBI and CIA information\nrequests in encrypted email. These initial reports, sometimes called\n\"Tippers\" or \"Snippets,\" were \"hidden in plain sight,\" meaning the\ninformation in the report did not reveal the source of the information.\nLater, FBI and CIA wanted to understand how NSA knew certain\ninformation that could not be provided in normal reporting channels.\nEventually, \"tear line\" reporting was established. Tear lines are used\nregularly by NSA as a way to report SIGINT-derived information and\nsanitized information in the same report to appropriately cleared\nindividuals. The sanitized \"tear line\" information conveys the same basic\nfacts as the COMINT-controlled information while hiding COMINT as the\nsource.\n\n(TS//51//NF) Dissemination of SIGINT Product\n(TS//SI//NF) Regardless of which organization submitted requests or leads\nto NSA, all resulting reports were sent to CIA and FBI. Reports answered\nspecific RFI questions or provided new investigative leads developed from\nchaining analysis. Reports contained selectors of interest (potential leads)\nwith potential terrorist connections, not full chaining results: NSA had\nminimal insight into how CIA and FBI used PSP products.\n\n(U) Discovery Requests\n(U) On occasion, the Department of Justice (DoJ) attorneys determine that\nthe facts of a particular matter justify a search ofNSA files and submit a\nsearch request. In response to those requests or in response to discovery\norders, NSA conducts a search of its databases to locate records that may\nfall within the scope ofDoJ's discovery obligations and Rule 16 ofthe\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Typically the search process begins\nwith a written request from DoJ including the names and aliases of\nindividuals. NSA attorneys work with personnel trained in the retrieval of\nNSA reports to craft search strategies reasonably designed to identify\nreporting that may be responsive to the request. These search strategies are\nthen used to perform electronic searches ofNSA repositories of\ndisseminated foreign intelligence reports. All responsive reports, to the\nextent any exist, are made available for review by DoJ.\n(TS//SI) NSA searches only databases of reported intelligence and does not\nsearch databases containing acquired but not processed information (e.g.,\nraw traffic) or acquired and processed but not reported or disseminated\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n18\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLWI/COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\ninformation/communications (e.g., gists). NSA would include in its search\napplicable disseminated foreign intelligence derived from the PSP.\n(TS//SI) After the search is completed, NSA provides all information,\nincluding PSP-derived material, to a small number of appropriately cleared\nDoJ individuals in the National Security Division who review the\ninformation on behalf of the DoJ and file motions on behalf of the\ngovernment and the United States Attorney.\n\n(U) Funding for NSA Activity Authorized by the PSP\n\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) NSA spent approximately $146,058,000 in CT\nsupplemental funds for Program activities from FY02 through FY06. The\nfunds were given annually to SID for Project MAINWAY hardware and\ncontract support, analytic tools and contract analytic support, and\ncollaborative partnerships with private sector companies.

The original Authorization and renewals were kept\nin the NSA Director's safe, and access to the documents was tightly\ncontrolled. By January 2007, nearly 3,000 people had been briefed\non the PSP, including members of Congress and the FISC.\n\n(U) Access to Legal Reviews\n(TS//SI//NF) The NSA did not have access to the early DoJ Office of\nLegal Counsel (OLC) opinions supporting the Attorney General's\nstatement that the PSP was legal. General Hayden, NSA lawyers, and the\nNSA Inspector General agreed that it was not necessary for them to see the\nearly opinions in order to execute the terms of the Authorization, but felt it\nwould be helpful to do so. NSA was, however, given access and provided\ncomments to the OLC opinion issued in 2004.\n\n(U) Access to OLC's Original Legal Review\n(TS//SV/NF) Two NSA requests for access to the original OLC legal\nopinion were denied.\n(TSIISVINF) First Request. NSA General Counsel Robert Deitz stated that\nhe asked the Vice President's Counsel if he could see the opinion. Even\nthough Mr. Deitz's request was denied, the Vice President's Counsel read a\nfew paragraphs of the opinion to him over the classified telephone line.\n\n(TS//SV/NF) Second Request. At a 8 December 2003 meeting with the\nDoJ Associate Deputy Attorney General to discuss collection of metadata\nand an upcoming NSA OIG compliance audit, NSA's IG and Deputy GC\nrequested to see the OLC legal opinion. The Counsel to the Vice President,\nwho unexpectedly attended the meeting, denied the request and said that\nany request to see the opinion had to come directly from General Hayden.\n(TS//SII/NF) General Hayden stated he never asked for or read the OLC\nlegal opinion supporting the PSP. The Deputy GC stated that it was his\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n21\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nunderstanding that the opinion was not shared with NSA because it was\nconsidered confidential legal advice to the President.\n\n(TSIISVINF) The IG, GC, and Deputy GC agreed that their inability to read\nthe OLC opinion did not prevent or impair them from executing and\noverseeing the Program. They were able to determine legality of the\nProgram independently from DoJ (see Appendix D). However, the IG said\nthat he found the secrecy surrounding the legal rationale to be \"odd.\"\nSpecifically, he said that it was \"strange that NSA was told to execute a\nsecret program that everyone knew presented legal questions, without\nbeing told the underpinning legal theory.\" The IG, GC, and Deputy GC all\nstated that they had yet to see the full text of the original OLC opinion.\n\n(UIIFOUO) Access to the May 2004 Opinion\n(U//FOUO) In 2003 and 2004, the DoJ Associate Deputy Attorney General\nand the OLC Assistant Attorney General visited NSA to receive briefings\non the PSP. On 04 May 2004, NSA, at the request of the OLC Assistant\nAttorney General, provided comments on the OLC's draft opinion on the\nLegality of the PSP. The OLC Assistant Attorney General submitted his\nopinion on 06 May 2004.\n\n(U//FOUO) Access to the Presidential Authorization\n(TS//SVINF) As directed by the White House, access to the original\nPresidential authorization and subsequent renewals was tightly controlled.\n(C) The Vice President's Counsel drafted the Authorizations and personally\ndelivered them to NSA. On a few occasions, NSA picked up the\nAuthorization at the White House.\n(C) The first Authorization and subsequent renewals were kept in a safe in\nthe Director's office. Initially, access was limited to General Hayden and a\nfew others, including three OGC attorneys, Program Managers, and certain\noperational personnel. Those with access were not allowed to disseminate\nthe Authorizations.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Importantly, most NSA operations personnel, including the\nChief of the CT Product Line, who approved tasking for content collection,\nwere not allowed to see the actual authorization. Rather, OGC answered\ntargeting, information sharing, and implementation legal questions on an\n\"on call\" basis for operators. When the Authorization changed, OGC\n\nTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n22\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLWI/COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nsummarized those changes in emails distributed to key program executives\nor communicated changes in due diligence meetings.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Such limited access to the Authorization was documented\nin an IG investigation as a primary cause of two early violations of the\nAuthorization. At the IG's recommendation, in March 2003, General\nHayden began issuing Delegation of Authority letters that explained the\nAuthorization as it applied to executing the Program. A new Delegation of\nAuthority was promulgated with each renewal of the Authorization. The\nDelegation of Authority letters were sent to the Program Manager and the\ntwo managers of the SID CT Product Line and not further disseminated.\n(See Section Six.)\n\n(U) Access to Program Information\n(TS//SV/STLW//NF) Between 4 October 2001 and 17 January 2007, NSA\ncleared over 3,000 people for the PSP.

By 31 January 2002, FISC Judge Royce Lamberth was\ncleared. By June 2002, over 500 people had been cleared, including two\nadditional members of Congress, Senator Daniel Inouye and former\nSenator Theodore Stevens, as well as FISC Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.\nSee Appendix G for a list, by date, of the number of people briefed into the\nProgram.\n\n(U) Non-Operational Personnel\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) Knowledge of the PSP was strictly limited at the express\ndirection of the White House. General Hayden, over time, delegated his\nPSP clearance approval authority for NSA, FBI, and CIA operational\npersonnel working the mission to the NSA PSP Program Manager. For\nmembers of Congress, FISC, outside counsel for providers, and the NSA\nIG, General Hayden had to obtain approval from the White House.\n(U//FOUO) From the start, General Hayden and NSA leadership pushed to\nkeep members of the legislative and judicial branches of government\ninformed. General Hayden said he told the Vice President that he had no\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n24\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nconcerns about the lawfulness of the Authorization but worried about the\npolitics. After some hesitancy, the White House gave General Hayden\npermission to brief certain members of Congress. In addition, the Chief\nJudge of the FISC was first cleared in January 2002 (see Section_).\n(TS//SI//NF) Interactions with Members of Congress. Between 25\nOctober 2001 and 17 January 2007, General Hayden, sometimes supported\nby operational target experts from the CT Product Line and SSO office,\nconducted over 49 briefings to members of Congress or their staff. (See\nAppedix _for a complete list of briefings.)\n(TS//SV/NF) General Hayden first briefed the following members of\nCongress on 25 October 2001 :\n\n(RJ Chair - House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\n(RJ Ranking Minority Member of the House Permanent Select\nCommittee on Intelligence\n(RJ Chair- Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(RJ Vice Chair- Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(TS//SI//NF) In addition, NSA received and responded to a variety of\nProgram-related inquiries from members of Congress, including Senators\nInouye, Stevens, Pelosi, and Rockefeller.\n(U//FOUO) General Hayden always believed that the PSP was legal. He\nsaid that during the many PSP-related briefings he gave to members of\nCongress, no one ever said that NSA should stop what it was doing. He\nemphasized that he did not just \"flip through slides\" during the briefings.\nThey lasted as long as attendees desired.\n(TS//SI//NF) Interactions with the FISC. On 31 January 2002, Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth was briefed on the PSP and on 17 May 2002, his\nsuccessor, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, was briefed. A law clerk was also\nbriefed in April2004. (See Section Five.)\n\n(UIIFOUO) The Clearance Process\n(TS//SI-ECV/NF) NSA managed the NSA clearance process. Clearance\nrequests were submitted to the PSP Program Office for Program Manager\napproval or disapproval. Access was granted only to those who needed it\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n25\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nto perform assigned job duties. The Program Manager questioned access\nrequests with unclear justifications. Approved requests were forwarded to\nthe Program security officer, who performed a security check. If the\nsecurity check yielded nothing to impede access, individuals were\ninstructed to go to the security office to read the \"Security Pre-Brief\nAgreement\" and sign a \"Sensitive Compartmented Information\nNondisclosure Agreement\" form. NSA's General Counsel also had the\nauthority to read in Attorneys from other agencies.\n(TS//SI//NF) On 20 May 2005, the Program Manager changed the PSP\nclearance request and re-certification process. The Project Security Officer\nassigned to Special Source Operations in the SIGINT Directorate assumed\nresponsibility for the PSP clearance process. (Special Source Operations\nmanaged all PSP-related collection for NSA.) Additionally, the Program\nManager initiated monthly PSP clearance briefings.\n(TS//SII/NF) From 4 October 2001 until23 May 2005, a two-level PSP\nclearance structure was used. One level was limited to the \"fact of'\nProgram existence. A second level included access to PSP targeting data\nthrough a \"must know\" principle. Access lists were maintained in the SSO\nSecurity Director's office on an internal SSO compartmented LAN.\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) Regular zero-based reviews were conducted by the SSO\nSecurity Director's office quarterly to validate that cleared individuals had\na continuing need for access to PSP information. The clearance did not\nautomatically transfer with individuals who moved to new assignments.\nThe clearance had to be re-justified for the new position, or the individual\nwould be debriefed from the Program.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n26\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) FOUR: NSA PRIVATE SECTOR RELATIONSHIPS\n(TS//SII/NF) To conduct foreign intelligence-gathering activities\nunder the PSP, NSA required the assistance of private companies,\nwhich provided access to international communications chokepoints\nin United States. Immediately after 11 September 2001, some private\ncompanies contacted NSA to offer support. Subsequent to PSP\nauthorization, NSA sent request letters to companies stating that\ntheir assistance was authorized by the President with legal\nconcurrence of the Attorney General.\n\n(U) Need for Private Sector Cooperation\n(TS//SII/NF) The United States carries out foreign intelligence activities\nthrough a variety of means. One ofthe most effective means is to partner\nwith commercial entities to obtain access to information that would not\notherwise be available.\n\n(U//FOUO) Telephony\n(TS//SII/NF) Most international telephone calls are routed through a small\nnumber of switches or \"chokepoints\" in the international telephone\nswitching system en route to their final destination. The United States is a\nmajor crossroads for international switched telephone traffic. For example,\nin 2003, circuit switches worldwide carried approximately 180 billion\nminutes of telephone communications. Twenty percent of this amount,\nover 37 billion minutes, either originated or terminated in the United\nStates, and another thirteen percent, over 23 billion minutes, transited the\nUnited States (neither originating nor terminating here). [NSA is\nauthorized under Executive Order 12333 to acquire transiting telephone\ncalls.]\n(TS//SII/NF) NSA determined that under the Authorization it could gain\naccess to approximately 81% of the international calls into and out of the\nUnited States through three corporate partners: COMPANY A had access to\n39%, COMPANY B 28%, and COMPANY C 14%. NSA did not seek\nassistance from local exchange carriers, because that would have given\nNSA access primarily to domestic calls.\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n27\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(UIIFOUO) Internet Communications\n(TS//SI//NF) AI Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations have made\nextensive use of the Internet. It is their preferred method of\ncommunication. Terrorists use Internet communications, particularly webbased services, because they are ubiquitous, anonymous, and usually free\nof charge. They can access Web-based email accounts and similar services\nfrom any origination point around the world.\n(TS//SI//NF) The United States is a major Internet communications hub.\nThe industry standard for characterization of the volume of Internet\ncommunications is bandwidth, which measures the amount of digital data\ntransmitted in one second- bits per second or bps. For example, data\navailable from 2002 shows that at that time, worldwide international\nbandwidth was slightly more than 290 Gbps 7 \u2022 Of that total, less than 2.5\nGbps was between two regions that did not include the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) The United States is also home to computer servers providing\nInternet communications services often used by terrorists. The majority of\nknown terrorist email addresses that NSA has tracked are hosted on U.S.-\n\n(U//FOUO) Evolution of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n\n(U) History of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n(TS//SI//NF) As far back as World War II, NSA has had classified\nrelationships with carefully vetted U.S. companies that assist with essential\nforeign intelligence-gathering activities. NSA maintains relationships with\nover 100 U.S. companies. Without their cooperation, NSA would not be\nable respond to intelligence requirements on a variety oftopics important\nto the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) Two of the most productive SIGINT collection partnerships\nthat NSA has with the private sector are with COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY B. These two relationships enable NSA to access large\nvolumes of foreign-to-foreign communications transiting the United States\n7\n(U) Gpbs is an abbreviation for Gigabits per second, which can also be described as one billion bits per second\nor 1,000,000,000 bps.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n28\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nthrough fiber-optic cables, gateway switches, and data networks. They also\nprovide foreign intelligence authorized under the FISA.\n(TS//SI//NF) According to General Alexander, General Hayden's\nreplacement as Director ofNSA/CSS, if the relationships with these\ncompanies were ever terminated, the U.S. SIGINT system would be\nirrevocably damaged, because NSA would have sacrificed America's home\nfield advantage as the primary hub for worldwide telecommunications.\n\n(U) Partnerships after 11 September 2001\n(TS//SI//NF) According to the former Deputy Chief of SSO, between 11\nSeptember 2001 and the 4 October 2001 Authorization, COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY B contacted NSA and asked \"what can we do to help?\"\nCOMPANY B personnel approached NSA SSO personnel through an\nexisting program. They said they noticed odd patterns in domestic calling\nrecords surrounding the events of 11 September and offered call records\nand analysis. With no appropriate authority under which to accept the call\nrecords, NSA suggested the company contact the FBI.\n\n(U//FOUO) Partnerships Supporting the PSP\n(TS//SI//NF) Once the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, NSA\nbegan a process of identifYing and visiting commercial entities requesting\ntheir support. While requesting help from corporate entities to support the\nPSP, NSA personnel made it clear that the PSP was a cooperative program\nand participation was voluntary. NSA knew that the PSP was an\nextraordinary program and understood if companies viewed it as too much\nof a liability.\n\n(TS//S/1/NF) NSA Approaches to Private Sector Companies\n(TS//SI//NF) 2001: On Columbus Day, 8 October 2001, NSA Special\nSource Operations (SSO) personnel responsible for the access relationships\nwith corporate partners COMPANY A, COMPANY B, and COMPANY C\nwere called in to work and informed that the President had authorized the\nPSP on 4 October 2001. The SSO personnel were tasked with initiating a\ndialog with the respective TS/SCI-cleared officials from COMPANIES A,\nB, and C to seek their cooperation under the new Authorization. Over the\nnext few business days, SSO personnel met separately with officials from\nthe three companies. Each company agreed to cooperate.\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINT/ ORCONINOFORN\n\n29\n\n\fTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//NF) Upon confirmation that formal NSA letters requesting their\nassistance were forthcoming, the providers, acting independently and\nofficially unaware of the cooperating agreements with other companies,\ninitiated collection to support the PSP.\n(TS//SI//NF) 2002: In early 2002, NSA SSO personnel met with the Senior\nVice President of Government Systems and other employees from\nCOMPANY E. Under the authority of the PSP, NSA asked COMPANY E\nto provide call detail records (CDR) in support of security for the 2002\nOlympics in Salt Lake City. On 11 February 2002, the company's CEO\nagreed to cooperate with NSA. On 19 February 2002, COMPANY E\nsubmitted a written proposal that discussed methods it could use to\nregularly replicate call record information stored in a COMPANY E facility\nand potentially forward the same information to NSA. Discussions with\nCOMPANY E continued in 2003. However, the COMPANY E General\nCounsel ultimately decided not to support NSA.\n(TS//SI//NF) On 5 September 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with internet provider COMPANY D's General Counsel to discuss the\nPSP and ask for the company's support. COMPANY D provided support,\nbut it was minimal. (For a description of COMPANY D's support, see\npage_, \"What Providers Furnished.\").\n(TS//SI//NF) On 29 October 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with internet provider COMPANY F's Legal and Corporate Affairs\npersonnel, and a former NSA OGC employee hired by COMPANY F as\nindependent counsel. NSA requested COMPANY F's support under the\nPSP for email content. At the meeting, COMPANY F requested a letter\nfrom the Attorney General certifying the legality of the PSP. In December\n2002, NSA's Commercial Technologies Group was informed that the\ncompany's CEO agreed to support the PSP. According to NSA's General\nCounsel, COMPANY F did not participate in the PSP because of corporate\nliability concerns.\n(TS//SII/NF) 2003: In April2003, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with the President and Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel, and\nother personnel from private sector COMPANY G. After the meeting, the\ncompany's General Counsel wanted to seek the opinion of outside counsel.\nNSA determined the risk associated with additional disclosure outweighed\nwhat COMPANY G would have provided.

On 8\nAugust 2003, the Attorney General sent COMPANY C a letter stating that\nthe request for support was a lawful exercise of authorities assigned to the\nPresident under Article II of the Constitution. Additionally, the Attorney\nGeneral directed COMPANY C to comply with NSA's request.\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) 2004: On 26 March 2004, the President amended his I1\nMarch 2004 authorization after deciding to discontinue bulk collection of\nInternet metadata. Before 11 March 2004, all authorizations covering\nInternet metadata collection (as well as content collection and telephony\nmetadata collection) were approved for form and legality by the Attorney\nGeneral. Accordingly, NSA's I2 March 2004 letters to the companies\nstated that the most recent authorization had been approved for form and\nlegality by the Counsel to the President, not the Attorney General as with\nprevious authorizations.\n(TS//SI/IECI//NF) 2005: Beginning 19 September 2005 through I4\nDecember 2006, new NSA/CSS Director General Alexander, or his\ndesignee, signed the request letters to the companies.\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) 2006 Attorney General Letters.

Selectors (email addresses and telephone\nnumbers) were provided by NSA's Office of Counterterrorism.\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) Content: Telephony. Under the PSP, companies\nprovided the content of one-end-foreign international telephone calls\n(telephony content) and the content of electronic communications (email\ncontent) of al Qaeda and its affiliates. COMPANIES A, B, and C provided\ntelephony content from communications links they owned and operated.\nThey had been providing telephony content to NSA before 2001 under\nFISA and E.O. 12333 authorities. NSA began to receive telephony content\nfrom COMPANIES A and Bon 6 October 2001 and COMPANY Con 7\nOctober 2001. This support ended on 17 January 2007.\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) Content: Internet Email. COMPANIES A, B, and C\nprovided access to the content of AI Qaeda and AI Qaeda-affiliate email\nfrom communication links they owned and operated. NSA received email\ncontent from COMPANY A as early as October 2001 until 17 January\n2007, from Company B beginning February-March 2002 through 17\nJanuary 2007, and from COMPANY C from April2005 until 17 January\n2007. From April2003 through November 2003, COMPANY D provided\na limited amount of email content under the PSP. It did not provide PSPrelated support after November 2003, but it did provide support under\nFISA.\n(TS//SI-ECII/NF) Metadata from Call Detail Records. COMPANIES A\nand B provided Call Detail Records to NSA. The records were used by\nNSA Counter-Terrorism metadata analysts to perform call chaining and\nnetwork reconstruction between known al Qaeda and al Qaeda-affiliate\ntelephone numbers and previously unknown telephone numbers with which\nthey had been in contact. Providers generated Call Detail Records as a\nnormal course of doing business (e.g., billing purposes and traffic\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n33\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nengineering). Records included all call events from the companies' long\ndistance and international communication networks. The Call Detail\nRecords were aggregated as large files by TS/SCI-cleared groups at\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY B and forwarded, on an hourly or daily\nbasis, across classified communications circuits to a PSP-restricted NSA\ndata repository.\nCOMPANY A provided PSP-authorized CDRs as early as November 2001,\nand COMPANY B began to provide CDRs in February 2002. Both\ncontinued to provide this support through the end of the PSP, and support\ncontinues today under the FISC Business Records Order. COMPANY C\nprovided select PSP-authorized CDRs from December 2002 through March\n2003.\n(TS//SI-ECV/NF) Internet Metadata. The last category of private sector\nassistance was access to Internet Protocol (IP) metadata associated with\ncommunications of al Qaeda (and affiliates) from data links owned or\noperated by COMPANIES A, B, and C. In order to be a candidate for PSP\nIP metadata collection, data links were first vetted to ensure that the\npreponderance of communications was from foreign sources, and that there\nwas a high probability of collecting al Qaeda (and affiliate)\ncommunications. NSA took great care to ensure that metadata was\nproduced against foreign, not domestic, communications.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) COMPANY A began providing PSP IP metadata\ncollection as early as November 2001. Although COMPANY B began\nproviding CO-ROMs ofPSP IP metadata in October 2001, an automated\ntransfer of data was not available until February-March 2002. The\nPresidential authority to collect IP metadata was terminated in March 2004.\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY B IP metadata collection resumed after the\nFISC Pen Register/Trap & Trace (PRITT) Order authorizing this activity\nwas signed on 15 July 2004.

Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who replaced Judge\nLamberth as Chief Judge in May 2002, and one law clerk were the only\nmembers of the FISC that NSA had briefed on the PSP In the spring of\n2004, NSA's interaction with Judge Kollar-Kotelly increased as NSA and\nDoJ began transitioning PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders in 2004.\nIt was not until after parts of the PSP were publicly revealed in\nDecember 2005 that all members of the FISC were briefed on the\nProgram.\n\n(U) NSA's Interaction with the FISC\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden stated that from the start of the PSP, he and\nother NSA leaders recognized the importance of keeping all three branches\nof the Government informed of the Program and pressed the White House\nto do so.\n(TS//SI//NF) In all of its interactions, neither NSA nor DoJ presented\nbefore the FISC the factual and legal issues arising from the PSP in any\ncase or controversy. Therefore, the FISC did not express any view or\ncomment on the legality or illegality of the PSP.\n\n(UIIFOUO) NSA Briefings on the PSP to Members of the FISC\n(TS//SII/NF) The White House first permitted NSA to brief the Chief Judge\nof the FISC in January 2002. General Hayden stated that on 31 January\n2002, he provided Judge Lamberth a very detailed PSP briefing, and the\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General in the DoJ OLC explained the\nProgram's legality. General Hayden stated that this briefing was prompted\nby a concern expressed by DOJ that PSP-derived information would be\nused in FISA applications\n(TS//SII/NF) On 17 May 2002, General Hayden briefed incoming Chief\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly, with Judge Lamberth in attendance, on the PSP. In a\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW/ICOMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n36\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nletter to the Counsel for Intelligence Policy dated 12 January 2005, Judge\nKollar-Kotelly stated that, on that date, she was also shown a short legal\nmemorandum, prepared by the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the\nDoJ, OLC, that set out a broad overview of the legal authority for\nconducting the PSP. Judge Kollar-Kotelly added that she was allowed to\nread the memorandum but not to retain it for study.\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA records show that Judge Kollar-Kotelly was briefed\nagain on 12 August 2002 at the White House. Although we found no\ndocumentation of the purpose of the meeting or topics discussed, Judge\nKollar-Kotelly stated in the January 2005 letter to the Counsel for\nIntelligence Policy that, at her request, she was permitted to review the\nAuthorization of the PSP on that date.\n(TS//SI//NF) In response to a New York Times \"warrantless wiretapping\"\nstory published in December 2005, General Alexander briefed all FISC\nmembers on the PSP on 9 January 2006.9\n\n(U) Transition of PSP Authorities to FISC Orders\n(TS//SV/NF) The transition ofPSP-authorized activities to FISC orders\nwas precipitated by preliminary results ofDoJ OLC legal review of the\ncomponents of the Program. In March 2004, OLC found three of the four\ntypes of collection authorized under the PSP to be legally supportable.\nHowever, it determined that, given the method of collection, bulk Internet\nmetadata was prohibited by the terms of FISA and Title IIJ.l 0\nConsequently, the White House Counsel rather than the Attorney General\nsigned the 11 March 2004 Authorization.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA Implements Controversial\n\n9\n\n(TS//STLW//SII/OR/NF)Judge Scullin did not attend this briefmg, but was later briefed on 31 January 2006.\nJudge Bates, a new judge, was briefed on 21 March 2006.\n10\n(TS//STLW//SII/OR/NF) OLC ultimately issued three opinions: 15 March 2004, 6 May 2004, and 16 July\n2004.\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n37\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(TSI/SIIINF) Until March 2004, NSA considered its\ncollection of bulk Internet metadata under the PSP to be\nlegal and appropriate. Specifically, NSA leadership,\nincluding OGC lawyers and the IG, interpreted the terms of\nthe Authorization to allow NSA to obtain bulk Internet\nmetadata for analysis because NSA did not actually\n\"acquire\" communications until specific communications\nwere selected. In other words, because the Authorization\npermitted NSA to conduct metadata analysis on selectors\nthat met certain criteria, it implicitly authorized NSA to\nobtain the bulk data that was needed to conduct the\nmetadata analysis.\n(TS//SI/INF) On 11 March 2004, General Hayden had to\ndecide whether NSA would execute the Authorization\nwithout the Attorney General's signature (IV-A/32-11 ).\nGeneral Hayden described a conversation in which David\nAddington asked, \"Will you do it (IV-A/32-11)?\" At that time,\nGeneral Hayden also said that he asked Daniel Levin,\nCounsel to the Attorney General, in March 2004 if he\nneeded to stop anything he was doing. Mr. Levin said that\nhe did not need to stop anything (IV-A/32-7 and IV-A/32a7&8). After conferring with NSA operational and legal\npersonnel, General Hayden stated that he decided to\ncontinue the PSP because 1) the members of Congress he\nbriefed the previous day, 10 March, were supportive of\ncontinuing the Program, 2) he knew the value of the\nProgram, and 3) NSA lawyers had determined the Program\nwas legal.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Eight days later on 19 March 2004, the President rescinded the\nauthority to collect bulk Internet metadata and gave NSA one week to stop\ncollection and block access to previously collected bulk Internet metadata. NSA\ndid so on 26 March 2004. To close the resulting collection gap, DoJ and NSA\nimmediately began efforts to recreate this authority in what became the PRITT\norder. By January 2007, the remaining three authorities had also been replicated in\nFISC orders: the Business Records (BR) Order, the Foreign Content Order, and the\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n38\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nDomestic Content Order. On 1 February 2007, the final Authorization was allowed\nto expire and was not renewed.\n\n(TS//SI/INF) Transition of Internet Metadata Collection to Pen Register/Trap\nand Trace Order Authority\n(TS//SV/NF) According to NSA personnel, the decision to transition\nInternet metadata collection to a FISC order was driven by DoJ. At a\nmeeting on 26 March 2007, DoJ directed NSA representatives from OGC\nand SID to find a legal basis, using a FISC order, to recreate NSA's PSP\nauthority to collect bulk Internet metadata.\n(TS//SV/NF) After extensive coordination, DoJ and NSA devised the\nPRITT theory to which the Chief Judge of the FISC seemed amenable.\nDoJ and NSA worked closely over the following months, exchanging\ndrafts of the application, preparing declarations, and responding to\nquestions from court advisers. NSA representatives explained the\ncapabilities that were needed to recreate the Authority, and DoJ personnel\ndevised a workable legal basis to meet those needs. In April 2004, NSA\nbriefed Judge Kollar-Kotelly and a law clerk because Judge Kollar-Kotelly\nwas researching the impact of using PSP-derived information in FISA\napplications. In May 2004, NSA personnel provided a technical briefmg\non NSA collection of bulk Internet metadata to Judge Kollar-Kotelly. In\naddition, General Hayden said he met with Judge Kollar-Kotelly on two\nsuccessive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the on-going\nefforts.\n(TS//SV/NF) The FISC signed the first PRITT order on 14 July 2004.\nAlthough NSA lost access to the bulk metadata from 26 March 2004 until\nthe order was signed, the order essentially gave NSA the same authority to\ncollect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP, except that it\nspecified the datal inks from which NSA could collect, and it limited the\nnumber of people that could access the data. The FISC continues to renew\nthe PRITT approximately every 90 days.\n\n(TSI/SII/NF) Transition of Telephony Metadata Collection to the Business\nRecords Order\n(TS//SV/NF) According to NSA General Counsel Vito Potenza, the\ndecision to transition telephony metadata to the Business Records Order\nwas driven by a private sector company. After the New York Times article\nwas published in December 2005, Mr. Potenza stated that one of the PSP\nproviders expressed concern about providing telephony metadata to NSA\nunder Presidential Authority without being compelled. Although OLC's\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n39\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nMay 2004 opinion states that NSA collection of telephony metadata as\nbusiness records under the Authorization was legally supportable, the\nprovider preferred to be compelled to do so by a court order. 11\n(TS//SII/NF) As with the PRITT Order, DoJ and NSA collaboratively\ndesigned the application, prepared declarations, and responded to questions\nfrom court advisers. Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT Order\nmade this process more efficient.\n(TS//SI//NF) The FISC signed the first Business Records Order on 24 May\n2006. The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk\ntelephony metadata from business records that it had under the PSP. And,\nunlike the PRTT, there was no break in collection at transition. The order\ndid, however, limit the number of people that could access the data and\nrequired more stringent oversight by and reporting to DOJ. The FISC\ncontinues to renew the Business Records Order every 90 days or so. (See\nAppendix H.)\n\n(TS//SI/INF) Transition of Internet and Telephony Content Collection to the\nForeign and Domestic Content Orders\n(TS//SI//NF) According to NSA OGC, the transition ofPSP content\ncollection to FISC orders was driven by DoJ. DoJ had contemplated a\ntransition in July 2004 when the FISC's signing of the PRITT order\nindicated its willingness to authorize PSP activities under court order.\nGiven this precedent, DoJ concluded the FISC might also accept content\ncollection. However, little progress was made until June 2005 when the\nDoJ OIPR with NSA OGC and SID representatives began researching the\nfeasibility of collecting PSP content under court order. In essence, DOJ\nand NSA needed to find a legal theory that would allow NSA to add and\ndrop thousands of foreign targets for content collection. Because the law\nwas more restrictive for content than metadata, NSA had serious\nreservations about whether it would be possible to find a workable solution\nusing a FISC order at that time, especially given the large number of\nselectors to be tasked and the complexity from legal and operational\nperspectives. For example:\n\n11\n\n(TS//STLW//SV/OR/NF) In addition to the telephony metdata that NSA was receiving from private sector\ncompanies as business records, it was also obtaining \"live\" telephony metadata from its own SIGINT\ncollection sources. It continued until mid-2005. (***We will include a reference to the corresponding\nnotification here.***)\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n40\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n[RJ (TS//SI//NF) NSA risked losing flexibility in the means of\ncollection, given that facilities and collection accesses were\ncomplex and in constant flux.\n\n[RJ (TS//SI//NF) In executing the PRITT and Business Records Orders,\nthe FISC's and DoJ's consistently increasing demands for\ninformation took NSA analysts away from target-related duties.\n\n[RJ (TS//SI//NF) The process imposed by the FISA statute was not able\nto handle the large volume ofNSA requests for FISC authorization\nneeded after\n11 September 2001.\n\n[RJ (TS//SII/NF) Because OLC's May 2004 opinion found that the\nexisting Authorization for content collection was lawful, there was\nno pressing need to find an alternative legal vehicle.\n(TS//SI//NF) In a letter dated 21 February 2006, the NSA GC expressed the\naforementioned concerns, among others, to the Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral suggesting that:\n\" .... now might be the right time to seek substantial revisions to\nthe FISA. The purpose of the legislation was to protect the\nprivacy of U.S. persons who could be subjected to surveillance,\neither intentionally or incidentally. Twenty-seven years later, the\nUnited States Government fmds itself obtaining FISA orders so\nthat it can carry out surveillance on foreign intelligence targets\nwho are outside the United States and, more often than not,\ncommunicating only with others outside the United States. This\nserves no U.S. person's privacy interests, was never anticipated by\nthe statute's drafters, and diverts valuable resources from the fight\nagainst terrorism. The FISA needs to be simplified and\nstreamlined.\"\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Ultimately, DoJ decided to pursue a FISC order for content\ncollection wherein the traditional FISA defmition of a \"facility\" as a\nspecific telephone number or email address was changed to encompass the\ngateway or cable head that foreign targets use for communications.\nMinimization and probable cause standards would then be applied. As\nwith the PRTT and Business Records orders, NSA collaborated with DoJ to\nprepare the application and declarations and provided the operational\nrequirements needed to continue effective surveillance.\n(TS/lSI!INF) After 18 months of concerted effort and coordination, the\nFISC ultimately accepted the theory for foreign selectors but rejected it for\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n41\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STLW/ICOMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\ndomestic selectors. Consequently, on 10 January 2007, the FISC signed\ntwo separate orders: the Foreign Content Order and the Domestic Content\nOrder.\n(TS//SV/NF) The Foreign Content Order negatively affected SIGINT\nexploitation. Most notably, the number of foreign selectors on collection\ndropped by 73 percent, from 11,000 selectors under PSP to 3,000 under the\norder. In addition, the administrative workload for NSA analysts to put\ncritical foreign selectors on collection was so burdensome that the order\nbecame operationally unsustainable. The order was eventually superseded\nby Congress' FISA modernization. It was temporarily replaced by the\nProtect America Act in August 2007 and then permanently replaced by the\nFISAAmendments Act in July 2008.\n(TS//SI//NF) The Domestic Content Order did not create a similar loss in\ncollection because so few domestic numbers were tasked at that time. It\ndid, however, slow operations because of the documentation required, and\nit took considerably longer to task under the order than under the PSP.\nOver time, the scope of the Domestic Content Order gradually decreased to\na single selector tasked for collection in January 2009. In January 2009,\nthe FBI, at NSA's request, assumed responsibility for the Domestic Content\nOrder and became the declarant before the FISC.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n42\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLWI/COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) SIX: NSA OVERSIGHT OF PSP SIGINT ACTIVITIES\n(U/IFOUO) NSA Office of General Counsel and SID, Oversight and\nCompliance provided oversight of NSA PSP activities from October 2001\nuntil January 2007. NSA OIG initiated PSP oversight in 2002.\n\n(U) Office of General Counsel\n(U//FOUO) The OGC was the first NSA organization with oversight\nresponsibilities to learn of the PSP, and it continued to provide significant\noversight over the life of the Program. The GC was briefed on 4 October\n2001, the day the Authorization was signed. On 6 October, he gave the\nDirector and Deputy Director talking points for briefing NSA personnel on\nthe new authority. The talking points included the fact that General\nHayden had instructed the GC and the lead attorney for operations to\nconduct routine review and oversight ofPSP activities.\n(U//FOUO) The NSAAssistant General Counsel for Operations provided\nmost of the Program oversight before the OIG learned of the PSP in 2002.\nHe and his successors reviewed proposed target packages and rejected\nthose not compliant with the Authorization, answered questions, gave\nbriefings, reviewed program implementation, and coordinated programrelated issues with DoJ.\n\n(U) SIGINT Directorate\n(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Directorate Office of Oversight and Compliance\n(O&C) represents the Director NSA/CSS and the Signals Intelligence\nDirector in overseeing compliance with authorities that govern the\ncollection, production, and dissemination of intelligence by the National\nSecurity Agency. The Chief of O&C was briefed on the PSP on 10\nOctober 2001. Initially, O&C's ability to provide effective oversight was\nlimited by insufficient staffing and a lack of methodologies to provide\nmeaningful oversight ofPSP collection. It, therefore, focused on\nidentifying problem areas while documenting program activity. It also\nhelped establish database partitions and assisted with data flow compliance\nissues to prevent uncleared personnel from seeing Presidentially-authorized\ncollection. Later, it reviewed justification statements for tasked selectors.\nAlso, it directed PSP-cleared SIGINT operations personnel to follow\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLWI/COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n43\n\n\fTOP SECRET/ISTLWI/COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nestablished procedures for the dissemination of U.S. person information\nand obtained approvals to permit dissemination of U.S. person information\n\n(U) Office of Inspector General\n(U//FOUO) NSA OIG conducted oversight ofPSP activities from August\n2002 until the Program ended in January 2007. It issued 12 formal reports\nand 14 Presidential Notifications on PSP activities at NSA.\n\nIRJ Investigations were conducted in response to specific incidents or\nviolations to determine the cause, effect, and remedy.\n\nIRJ Reviews were conducted to determine the adequacy of management\ncontrols to ensure compliance with the Authorization and related\nauthorities; to assess the efficiency and effectiveness in mitigating\nhigh-risk activities associated with the Program; and to identify\nimpediments to satisfying the requirements of the Authorization and\nrelated authorities.\n\n1RJ Presidential Notifications were drafted for the Director's signature\nto notify the President's Counsel about violations of the\nAuthorization. (See below for additional details.)\n\n1RJ Monthly Due Diligence Meetings were held by program officials\nto exercise \"due diligence\" in addressing program issues and\ndevelopments. The OIG attended these meetings to stay aware of\nprogram activities.\n(U//FOUO) OIG also provided oversight of FISC-authorized activity\npreviously conducted under Authorization.\n(U//FOUO) See Appendix H for a list ofOIG reports on PSP activity at\nNSA.\n\nTOP SECRETI/STLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\n44\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U) NSA IG Not Cleared until 2002\n\n(TSIISIIINF) We could not determine exact reasons for\nwhy the NSA IG was not cleared for the PSP until\nAugust 2002. According to the NSA General Counsel,\nthe President would not allow the /G to be briefed\nsooner. General Hayden did not specifically recall why\nthe /G was not brought in earlier, but thought that it\nhad not been appropriate to do so when it was\nuncertain how long the Program would last and before\noperations had stabilized. The NSA /G pointed out\nthat he did not take the IG position until April 2002, so\nNSA leadership or the White House may have been\nresistant to clearing either a new or an acting /G.\n(TS//SII/NF) Regardless, by August 2002, General\nHayden and the NSA General Counsel wanted to\ninstitutionalize oversight of the Program by bringing in\nthe /G. General Hayden recalled having to \"make a\ncase\" to the White House to clear the /G at that time.\n\n(U/IFOUO) 0/G concerns lead to change\n(C) In addition to formal recommendations made in review and\ninvestigative reports, OIG concerns about access to the terms of the\nPresidential authorization and about the means of reporting PSP violations\nresulted in three major changes.\n(C) First, in December 2002, the IG recommended that General Hayden\nformally delegate authority to NSA operational personnel, some of whom\nhad unknowingly violated terms of the Authorization. The Counsel to the\nVice President, demanding secrecy, refused to let them see terms of the\nauthority, which had been delegated by the President to the Secretary of\nDefense, who delegated it to the Director ofNSA. General Hayden issued\nthe first \"Delegation of Authority\" letter to key operational personnel in the\nSID on 4 March 2003. Subsequent delegation letters were issued each time\nthe President renewed the authority.\n\nTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINTIORCONINOFORN\n\n45\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINT!ORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(C) Second, in March 2003, the IG advised General Hayden that he should\nreport violations of the Authorization to the President. In February of\n2003, the OIG learned ofPSP incidents or violations that had not been\nreported to overseers as required, because none had the clearance to see the\nreport.\n\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Before March 2003, NSA quarterly reports on\nintelligence activities sent to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board\n(through the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence\nOversight) stated that the Director was not aware of any unlawful\nsurveillance activities by NSA other than that described in the report.\nBeginning in March 2003, at the IG's direction, NSA quarterly reports\nstated that except as disclosed to the President, the Director was not aware\nof any unlawful surveillance activities by NSA. Also beginning in March\n2003, PSP violations, including those not previously reported to the\nIntelligence Oversight Board, were reported in \"Presidential Notifications.\"\n(U//FOUO) Third, shortly after learning about the Program, the IG\nparticipated in a September 2002 meeting of key cleared personnel at\nwhich important PSP matters were discussed. He recommended that these\ntypes of meetings be held every month. As a result, monthly \"due\ndiligence\" meetings were held until the Program ended.\n\nTOP SECRETIISTLWI/COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n46\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nThis page intentionally left blank.\n\nTOP SECRET//STLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n47\n\n\f\fTOP SECRET/ISTLW//COMINT/ORCONINOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nTOP SECRETIISTLW//COMINTIORCON/NOFORN\n\n\f",
