Provisioning information is\noften sent between these organisations by email or FTP with simple methods that\ncan be broken out by OPC-CAP, or occasionally with no at alli. With targeting in\nplace, a large volume of IMSI and associated Ki values can be harvested from UDAQ \ncorporate CZC data repository.\n\nWith known individuals and operators targeted, items of interest can often be returned from\nbulk CZC data using a simple search for the terms ?Ki? and in close proximity. Results\nwill often contain a large number of unrelated items, however an analyst with good\nknowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of\nlarge batches of Kis.\n\nWork has already been canted out to automate this sifting of bulk data; reference 1 describes\ntechniques successfully trialled so far. This work builds upon these techniques introducing a\nsystem to bulk query UDAQ itself, perform the sifting operation on data to identify items of\ninterest, packaging these up in a form that can usefully be interpreted by researchers in OPC-\nCAP. Summary information is also produced for the use of in TD SD.\n\nThe main desired outcomes from this work are to:\n\n- Improve effectiveness at finding Kis in CZC content repositories. By\nautomating the approach it should be possible to perform a more thorough search than\nTDSD has had the manpower to do at present. This is likely to bring higher volumes\nof Kis and IMSIs to light in addition to spotting interesting items that would not have\ncome to the attention of previously.\n\n- Improve target knowledge. A more complete picture of data in CZC\nrepositories will allow TDSD to view the effectiveness of current targeting, spot\ntrends as target behaviour changes and also spot any obvious gaps in coverage for\nexample providers for whom this type of harvesting is ineffective.\n\n- Develop and enhance TDSD's harvesting methodology. This methodology is based\naround knowledge of how network operators, SIM suppliers and hardware providers\nco-operate to share data. By looking at the types of organisations\nassociated with traffic seen in the wild we can test assumptions about communication\npatterns we expect to take place, improving our knowledge of relationships between\nthese companies.\n\n \n\n1 It should also be noted that TDSD have observed the use of strong products being used\n(eg. PGP products). These have become increasineg common and used as standard for large SIM\nsupplierslpersonalisation centres to exchange SIM output and input data with mobile neuvork\noperators.\n\n4of 24\n\nthis information is exen1pt from disciosure under the freedom of information r'tet 2000 and ntay be subject to other LK\n\ninfonnation legislation. ttefer disciosure reansLs to GCHQ on?

The next stage is to trawl these results for items of\nvalue. If a list of IMSI and Ki values is found this can be copied from the tool and sent on to\nUPC-CAP for further processing.

This was used to automate the querying of C2C content in UDAQ.\nGiven a standard SQL query wrapped in an XML form this will return a package containing\nall matching C2C intercept.\n\nA base query, a proximity search for the strings and was used for this experiment.\nThis can be seen in Appendix 1. Date fields are marked with placeholders so these can be\nautomatically filled out using regular expressions at run time.\n\nResults are returned as a compressed ?le containing a CCDF2 mesh. A routine was then\nwritten to unpack this mesh, allowing results to be treated from then on as a set of plain text\nfiles.\n\nScripts were developed to perform all steps of the operation automatically, retrieving\npackaged data to be interpreted by the user (reference 6). This operates as follows:\n\nThe script JrunRemoteQuerysh is used to launch the process. This:\n\n- Requests a date range to query\n- Rewrites the query XML file with required dates\n\n \n\n2 Common Data Format. Details are described in reference 4.\n\n20f 24\n\nthis information is exempt from diseiosure under the freedom of information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under otner LK\ninfonnation legislation. ttefer diseiosure requests to GCHQ on? (non-set) or email\n\nTOPSECRETSTRAPI\n\n\n\n- Transfers all required files onto the LLANDARCYPARK server, including\npulludaq.sh\n\npulludaqsh is then executed on LLANDARCYPARK. This:\n\n- Executes the bulk IIB query (can take 5-10 mins)\n0 Retrieves query results as compressed CCDF files\n- Unpacks the CCDF contents into a directory as plain text for processing.\n\nThe next stage is to identify content of interest in the processed ?les.\n\n2.1.2 Identifying Content\n\nOnce plain text is retrieved from IIB this is parsed to identify items containing IMSI and Ki\nvalues. A previously proven rule based approach is used to identify content of interest.\n\nThe routine scrapes the plain text identifying lines containing IMSI and Ki values, which may\nappear in intercept in any conceivable format. The technique also attempts to identify header\ninformation describing the contents, as well as associating results with a UDAQ identifier that\ncan be later researched. Further technical discussion on this technique is available in reference\n1, TDSD Technical Note 11: What Makes a Good PCS Key Harvester?.\n\nA final stage generates statistics and additional information linked to the results, developed in\nconsultation with TD SD This includes:\n\n- A list of unique UDAQ item identi?ers resulting in valid Ki IMSI data. This allows\nto conduct further research into these traffic sources. These are ranked\naccording to the number of sections of IMSI data seen in each UDAQ item.\n\n- A list of network and country codes identi?ed. These are derived from the first 6\ncharacters of an IMSI and used to provide an overview of countries and networks\nidenti?ed.\n\n- A list of associated email addresses. This is generated by scraping all email addresses\nfrom results found to contain valid Ki data. These are then ranked by the number of\noccurrences of each address.\n\nCare should be taken when interpreting ranking positions. In the case of email addresses a\nhigher score does not necessarily indicate association with more Kis, however they can\nprovide an indication of how active an address is.\n\nAn example set of statistics produced is shown in Appendix 2.\n\n2.1.3 Processing 1 storing\n\nOutput files generated by the previous step typically take the form shown in Appendix 3 \nsection markers separate the UDAQ item reference, potential header information and \ncontent. This format was developed alongside It should be noted that although the\ncontent will contain IMSI and K1 data it could take any conceivable form it is presented as\nfound in raw intercept. It is the task of OPC-CAP to interpret any additional data in any\nrecognised header section, decoding as necessary. Ki values may still be at this\nstage.\n\n80f 24\n\nthis information is exempt from diScioscre under the freedom of information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other LK\n\ninfonnation legislation. ttefer diScioscre requests to GCHQ on?

These are described\nbelow:\n\n- Improved access rights for bulk data retrieval\nAccess to bulk access capability runs on research prototype hardware and is\nsupported only on a best endeavours basis. Making use of a processing user to obtain\ndata, the maximum classification that can be returned is TOP SECRET STRAP2 UK\nEyes Only. This means that some data currently retrieved using the manual method,\nsuch as password-recovered items, is not available to the automated system. An\nimproved system would allow bulk access to more intercept data.\n\n- Processing performance\nPerformance of queries on LLANDARCYPARK is comparable to that of UDAQ,\nhowever when large numbers of items are retrieved the generation of statistics can\ntake some time (sometimes hours for large sets). Some simple code optimisations\ncould significantly improve this performance.\n\n- Improvements to summary information scores and ranking\nThe value of using ranks to assess the usefulness of an email or UDAQ item\nidentified is limited, since the score used relates to the number of sections of Ki data\nin a given file. This means where a very large number of IMSIs are identified, but\nthey appear in a single block, a low score is awarded. A value relating to the number\nof IMSI items would be more useful to identify the most important results.\n\nQof 24\n\nthis information is exempt from discioscre under the freedom of information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other LK\n\ninfonnation legislation. ttefer discioscre requests to GCHQ on?

New Ki and IMSI pairs\nare regularly seen for AWCC, TDCA and MTN.\n\nA large batch of Somali Kis was recovered in mid-March using this automated process.\nSomali providers are not on list of interest, hence it is likely this item would have\nbeen missed by manual collection, however this was usefully shared with NSA. A number of\nother unexpected providers were brought to light including Babilon?Mobile in Tajikistan and\nIcelandic provider Nova 3C.\n\nThis has demonstrated that an automated Ki recovery method can effectively identify IMSI\nand Ki pairs from bulk C2C sources for key targets, with the added benefit of identifying\ncontent that would not normally come to analyst attention. The chart presented provides an\noverview of networks accessible in C2C repositories.\n\n3.2 Target Discovery\n\n11 of 24\n\nthis information is exempt from disciosure under the lireedoin of information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other LK\ninformation legislation. ltefer disciosure requests to CCHQ on (non-set) email \n\nTOPSECRETSTRAPI\n\nTOPSECRETSTRAPI\nAn experiment was canted out to make use of results from this technique for target discovery.\n\nStatistics produced alongside results include email addresses appearing in\ncommunications alongside this content. These email addresses are scored by the number of\ntimes they are seen. It was proposed that analysis of these addresses should bring to light\ncommon communication patterns between operators, as well as help identify actors most\ninvolved in the sharing of K1 data.\n\nUDAQ C2C collection is targeted; hence any traffic found will originate from an identifier in\ncorporate systems. However it was surmised that additional useful contact addresses\ncould be found associated with traf?c.\n\nAll email addresses associated with traffic in each of the 6 periods were compiled together.\nThis resulted in a list of 154 unique email addresses, each associated with a score. From this it\nwas possible to identify a number of candidate targets for further research that scored highly:\n\n- target?s email handle suggests an Ericsson employee\n\nusing a webmail account\n\n- -@huawei.com this was the highest scoring overall address, a previously\nunknown target on the Huawei network.\n\n- mm highest scoring webmail address, indicating lots of activity\nassociated with IMSIs and Kis, was a previously unknown target.\n\n- ics.mc a number of users associated with this previously unknown domain.\nEDI research shows international gateway for South African provider MTN\n\n- an MSN address found to be associated with IMSIs and Kis\n\nThis has demonstrated a number of opportunities to apply this harvesting technique to target\ndiscovery efforts.\n\n3.3 Measuring Targeting Effectiveness\n\nAn experiment was carried out to discover the effectiveness of current targeting\nmethods.\n\nEmail addresses identified in the previous section were converted into a list of domains, again\nscored by the number of associations with data. The complete list can be seen in\nAppendix 5.\n\nIt was then possible to group domains into 5 categories:\n\n- Hardware Companies Organisations such as Huawei, Ericsson, who manufacture\nPCS hardware.\n\n- Network Operators Operators of mobile networks such as MTN Iranceli,\nBelgacom.\n\n- SIM Suppliers SIM Suppliers or SIM Personalisation centres, for example Bluefish.\n\n- Mail Providers Users of general email providers (Cmail, Yahoo etc).

Contrary to\nexpectation the vast majority of addresses seen belonged either to network operators or\nhardware companies.\n\nThis could indicate increased use of strong products amongst SIM suppliers,\nleaving only the other groups open to this method of exploitation. TDSD may wish to ensure\nthat targeting for SIM suppliers is up to date, as well as investigating the possibility of\ntargeting hardware companies and network operators to improve results.\n\n3.4 Comparison with present efforts\n\n3.4.1 Manually collected Kis\n\nA manual trawl of UDAQ data was performed against AWCC for the period between 28Th\nMarch and 10L11 April 2010.

IMSI values for AWCC. The automated search\nresulted in 320 values, 26 of which were from the AWCC network. The automated methods\nalso identified 10 unique IMSIs from Roshan and 83 from MTN Yemen (results 3 and 23).\n\nIt can be seen that the automated search ntissed the majority of manually recovered items.\nReasons for this are noted in the comments column: in all cases the string IMSI did not appear\nin the results file, hence these items were not returned in the initial bulk query. The majority\nof these items also had IMSI and Ki data split across multiple lines, meaning they would not\nhave been identified by the detection techniques employed in this work in any case. Both\ntechniques found comparable quantities of IMSIs for AWCC with the result sets being mostly\ncomplimentary.\n\nThis has demonstrated that although the automated method is able to return a representative\nset of items from bulk data, and often-larger volumes of Kis, it tended to miss items found\nmanually. More work is required both at the initial bulk query stage as well as with\nprocessing and detection techniques.\n\n14 of 24\n\nThis information is exenzpl from disclosure under the l-reedom oi i::t'or:11ation Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption under other UK\n\ninformation legislation.

Many of the larger batches of\nKis received in this period were provided by partners on request, and it is difficult to estimate\nthe real time period they were collected over. Additionally, the value of a small number of Kis\nshould not be underestimated as these can often be used as seeds to generate much larger\nbatches.\n\nIt is clear that the automated technique is able to identify Kis for a greater range of networks,\nsuccessfully identifying a large batch of Kis for a particular Somali provider.\n\nThis comparison did bring to light a number of networks where the C2C harvesting method is\nnot bringing results, notably the Pakistani networks Mobilink and Telenor for whom we do\nhave a store of Kis.

In\naddition to Ki harvesting a number of further applications have been demonstrated: the\nmonitoring of mobile network activity, where views have been provided over a 3?month\nperiod; discovery of new target identifiers associated with detected traffic; and methods of\nmeasuring the effectiveness of current techniques.\n\nA picture of types of organisations associated with Ki traffic has been constructed providing a\nnew view of mobile network operations to TD SD.\n\nIt has also been shown that although the automated method is able to return a rcpresentative\nset of items from bulk data, it often fails to detect all items that would be found manually.\nMore work is required at the initial bulk query stage and also with detection techniques to\nensure accurate and full coverage of Ki data.\n\nWhilst problems have been identified such as limits on coverage due to access restrictions,\nthis work makes a strong case that such harvesting efforts will continue to deliver results in\nTDSD and areas such as the CP SD team.\n\nIt is the author?s view that increased levels of corporate support for such bulk data processing\nactivities would allow TDSD, as well as many other business areas, to benefit from more\napplications of these techniques.\n\n4.1 Future Work\n\nA number of items of follow-up work have been identified:\n\n0 Improving initial query effectiveness\nIt has been shown that the initial base ?proximity? query is not effective enough to\nreturn all results currently found using manual harvesting. Work should be carried\nout to identify more effective queries to process data on. An alternative option is to\nrun the technique repeatedly against a number of result sets.\n\nI Improved detection techniques\nDetection techniques are unable to identify Ki and IMSI data where the fields of\ninterest appear on separate lines [see section 3.4.2). An improved technique would\nensure these results are also detected and included.\n\nI Improved summary information\nSummary information currently consists of a list of email addresses, UDAQ item\nidentifiers and network codes associated with simple scores. would like to\nbe able to find the UDAQ item associated with a particular IMSI or email address\nmore easily. An improved scoring system would also help more accurately\n\n17 of 24\n\nthis is exempt front disclosure tinder the reedom of information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption ..ncic-r other LJK\n\ninformation legislation.

Additionally, the accuracy of results could be improved by\ndetecting only IMSIs with valid country and network codes.\n\nI Bulk access limitations\nThe maximum classification that can be returned from LLANDARCYPARK is TOP\nSECRET STRAP2 UK Eyes Only. This limits access to some data likely to contain\nIMSI and Ki values, such as password-recovered items. An improved system would\nallow bulk access to the full range of data.\n\nI Adapting technique to be used for other key types\nThis technique currently identifies only IMSI and Ki values. In time it should be\nextended to also support efforts against OTA keys, UMTS and more.\n\nI Data mining opportunities\nOpportunities exist to mine bulk data produced during this process, potentially\ndetecting further items of interest and developing knowledge of targets involved.\nProposed ideas include detecting requests for batches of data by identifying\nmessages containing maximum and minimum SIM values.\n\nI Corporate support for bulk C2C processing\nAccess to bulk access capability is restricted to a small number of users,\nhowever a number of business units have expressed an interest. This work should\ncontinue to be used to develop requirements for a corporate solution allowing more\nbusiness units to benefit from these types of techniques.\n\n18 of 24\n\nthis is exempt front disclosure tinder the reedom of information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption ..ncic-r other LJK\n\ninformation legislation.

    "doc_text": " TO USA, NATO\n\nNlM/Cyber 14 September 2011\n\nTalking Points\n\n \n\nSubject: NATO) NATO Civilian Intelligence Council?Cyber Panel\nNational Input\n\nA. Threat Overview (U)\n\nThank you for the opportunity to discuss our assessment on the cyber threat\nto NATO. I would like to start by making a clear distinction between the terms \"cyber\nespionage\" and \"cyber attack\":\n\n0 Cyber espionage is the theft of information that is being stored or transmitted as\ndigital data.\n\n0 Cyber attack refers to malicious activity intended to disrupt data networks or deny\naccess to them, to manipulate or corrupt the data on them, or to cause physical\ndamage to infrastructure and equipment connected to them.\n\nNATO) We believe it is important to maintain a clear distinction between cyber\nespionage and cyber attacks because the probability of, consequences from and\nresponse to the two types of cyber incidents are different. The vast majority of\ncyber incidents against NATO networks are cyber espionage, not cyber attacks.\n\nNATO) We assess that cyber espionage is?and will remain?the principle\nthreat to NATO systems over the next three years. We judge that cyber attacks against\nNATO networks by most nation states, including Russia and China, are unlikely outside\nof the context of a diplomatic or military conflict. However, we are concerned that the\naccess that adversaries gain from cyber espionage activities could accelerate the\ndeployment of cyber attacks in the event of such a conflict.\n\nB. Specifics (U)\n\nB1: Threat Actors (U)\nNATO) Russia poses the greatest cyber threat to NATO computer networks due\n\nto its strategic interests, its record of effective cyber collection, and its capability to\ntarget and disrupt NATO and member state computer infrastructures.\n\nTO USA, NATO\n\nTO USA, NATO\n\nNATO) Russia is a robust, multi-disciplinary cyber actor with proven\naccess and tradecraft which can conduct the full scope of operations, including\ncomputer network exploitation, insider-enabled operations, supply-chain\noperations, and computer network attack.\n\n0 NATO) In addition, Russian nationalist hackers?who previously\nconducted cyber attacks against Estonian and Georgian networks?could target\nNATO systems in the event of a military or diplomatic conflict that pitted NATO\nagainst Russian interests.\n\nNATO) China lags behind Russia in terms of sophistication, but the scale and\nscope of their overall cyber activities and their increasing interest in information\nassociated with NATO and its member states makes them the second most strategic\nthreat to NATO networks.\n\n0 NATO) Beijing has dramatically expanded its cyber espionage\noperations in the last five years and has conducted network intrusions?probably\nsponsored by the People?s Liberation Army?against US military and diplomatic\norganizations.\n\n0 NATO) We judge that China?s concerns over NATO activities on its\nperiphery, including ISAF operations in Afghanistan, almost certainly would make\nNATO information and networks a target for Chinese cyber espionage.\n\nNATO) Although ?hacktivist? groups such as Anonymous have made headlines\nrecently with their theft of NATO information, the threat posed by such activity is minimal\nrelative to that of nation-states.\n\nNATO) One area of concern, however, is the possibility of nation-states\nusing hackers as proxies for their own operations. Difficulties with real-time\nattribution make it difficult to quickly identify threats, meaning that cyber\nespionage or cyber attacks can be disguised as cyber-crime or patriotic hacking\nactivity. The example of Russian nationalist hackers targeting Estonia and\nGeorgia serves to underscore this concern.\n\n82: Methods (U)\nNATO)\n\nNATO) We assess that any unclassified NATO network that is directly\nconnected to the Internet should be considered potentially compromised, creating\nuncertainty regarding the confidentiality, integrity and continued availability of all data on\nthat network. Spear phishing, although relatively unsophisticated at a technical level,\nhas proved to be an effective intrusion method for many malicious actors. Full\nimplementation of security best practices would help to significantly reduce the threat of\ncyber espionage against unclassified networks.\n\nTO USA, NATO 2\n\nTO USA, NATO\n\nNATO) As former deputy secretary of Defense William pointed out in a\nmedia article, in 2008 classified US military systems were infected with a cyber\nexploitation tool deployed by a foreign nation state, exemplifying the potential threat to\nprotected military networks. We assess that the most immediate threat to classified\nNATO networks are insiders working on behalf of third-party nation states and unwitting\nNATO officers who create vulnerabilities by mishandling classified information systems\nand data, such as emailing classified NATO information through Internet-connected\nsystems or using an infected thumb drive with classified computers. In addition, the\npresence of Russian intelligence officers operating in NATO spaces raises the risk of\nclose access penetrations. Without the implementation of more robust security policies,\nmonitoring tools, and training to counter these factors, we assess that any data on\nclassified NATO networks is at potential risk.\n\nBB: Other Factors (U)\n\nNATO) The discussion so far today on the threat actors and the methods they\ncould employ represents the standard methodology for discussing and evaluating\npotential solutions to cyber security. Athreat-based analytical model is useful for\nunderstanding the problem, but it only captures part of the picture.\n\nNATO) An alternative way to think about the defense of NATO's networks is to\nstart by identifying which NATO data or networks would have the most consequences if\nthey were stolen or disrupted, and work from there. Prioritizing the data and networks\nwe need to protect the most would make it easier to map NATO gaps and vulnerabilities\nto actionable solutions, develop mitigation and response plans, and enable us to better\nallocate scarce resources.\n\nNATO) Separately, efforts to work with non-Alliance members on cyber\nsecurity issues are commendable. The Alliance?s ongoing work with the European Union\nand recent discussions on partnering with India only underscore the point that this is a\nglobal issue that affects everyone. We appreciate the Alliance?s efforts to improve its\nown cyber defenses and look forward to continued work in this area.\n\nPrepared by: Jessica Vielhuber\nNational Intelligence Council\n(secure)\n\nTO USA, NATO 3\n\n"

Saturday, 10 Nov 2012\n\n\nI SIDtoday Article\n0 Let?r the Editor\nSocial Media Page\nWho Else Is Targeting Your Target? Collecting Data Stolen by Hackers\nFROM: Menwith Hill Station (F77)\n\nRun Date: 05/06/2010\n\nHackers are stealing the emails of some of our by collecting the hackers? \"take,\" we 1) get access to the emails themselves and 2) get insights into who's being hacked.\n\nPeople who open attachments from unknown senders (gasp) or respond to \"Nigerian\" money laundering emails aren't the only individuals on the intemet being hacked. Some ofour targets are also being targeted by outside forces, both by state-sponsored and freelance hackers. Could your targets communications be the\ntarget ofother countries or groups?\n\nRecently, Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) and Menwith Hill Station discovered and began exploiting a target-rich data set being stolen by hackers. The hackers' sophisticated email-stealing intrusion set is known as INTOLERANT. Ofthe traffic observed, nearly half contains category hits\nbecause the attackers are targeting email accounts of interest to the Intelligence Community. Although a relatively new data source, TOPIs have already written multiple reports based on INTOLERANT collect.\n(U) Technique\n\nTo the analyst using SIGINT databases, collected INTOLERANT data looks like Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail. In this case, though, the traf?c fairy has been hard at To hide the traffic, the hackers' programs split a victim's email into pieces. Each piece is then obfuscated, given a different, spoofed,\nsource IP address and sent to a different destination IP address. Having different destination IP addresses serves to route the pieces across separate channelsl ofa satellite signal. The channels being used carry large amounts oftraf?c, allowing INTOLERANT data to hide as background noise. Much collaboration between CSE, MHS,\nGCHQ and NSAW has brought about the transformation data we collect into \"readable\" SMTP mail.\n\nVictim Set\n\nINTOLERANT traffic is very organized. Each event is labeled to identify and categorize victims. Cyber attacks commonly apply descriptors to each victim - it helps herd victims and track which attacks succeed and which fail. Victim categories make INTOLERANT interesting:\nA Indian Diplomatic Indian Navy\n\nCentral Asian diplomatic\n\nChinese Human Rights Defenders\n\nTibetan Pro-Democracy Personalities\n\nUighur Activists\n\nEuropean Special Rep to Afghanistan and Indian photo-joumalism\n\nTibetan Government in Exile\n\nNew victims appear to ?ood out their entire inbox, going back months or, even, years. Then only new mail is transmitted. Hundreds ofemails are seen on an average day.\n(U) Attribution\n\nWithin the world ofcyber exploitation, attribution is always difficult and INTOLERANT is no exception. Initial analysis points toward a likely state sponsor based on the level ofsophistication and the victim set. Determining which state is sponsoring the activity has yet to be done. Since the traffic is traveling over satellite,\nthe culprit must be within the satellite beam's footprint to receive the stolen emails. There was hope the footprint would point to which state was responsible, but that hope was not realized as shown in the image.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAttribution data is di?icult, since the satellite beam footprint is so large. Eventually, the virtual team working this e?ort would like to know who is hacking whom.\n(U) Way Forward\n\nAnalysis continues with the goal ofleaming more about the attacks as well as improving attribution. Efforts are also being made to inform relevant parties, including NTOC, due to the obvious operations security (OPSEC) concerns where US and UK authorities have contact with Indian diplomats or the European Special\nRepresentative, for instance.\n\nSo the next time you scan your target?s email, [my special attention to the case notation. Ifit contains 4PXFIL2 (E9BDJ4PXFILtargetNumber in the case then the email is likely available because somebody else has hacked your target. For additional details, send an email to mhsindex@nsa.ic.gov.\n\nPOCs: INDEX team \n\n(U) Notes:\n1. Packet Identifiers, PIDs are used in satellite hub signals to designate sub-channels.\n2. 4PXFIL stands for \"fourth party exfil\" or \"out-sourcing These terms are used within the SIGINT community to refer to the practice of collecting data as it transits the Internet going from the victim's computer to the attacker's.\nSIDtoday editor's note: This article is reprinted from Horizon newsletter, March edition.\nComments/ estions a out this article?\nE1 SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside without the consent of \n\nInformation Owner: Page Publisher: \nLast Modified: 11/10/2012 Last Reviewed: 11/10/2012\n\nDYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS\nTOP SECRET SI TK REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL\nDERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108\n\n"

So far, we have worked towards making structured datasets available on the high side for to use - this data is available within HAPPY TRIGGER. We are now looking\ntowards making use ofmore unstructured information (blogs, forums, Twitter). LOVELY HORSE seeks to experiment with provision ofan indexed repository ofunstructured information that can be used to push content of interest to individual via a variety ofmechanisms.\n\nThe initial LOVELY HORSE can be accessed from M.

Accessing these resources involves using specific IEDI terminals, or reading up at home. We need to make this information available to on the\nhigh side at their normal terminals.\n\nHowever, there is a balance to be found - don't have the time to spend hours and hours reading through loads ofblogs. In addition, we don't want this repository to be yet another tool that have to access - this information needs to be incorporated into existing work?ows.\n\nWe need to find away to index this information so that only get a relevant subset ofthis information pushed to them.\n\n[edit] Initial prototype\nWe are working with TRIG to make use ofthe existing architecture for capturing tweets ?om Twitter. We are also working with CISA around techniques they are developing to capture blog content. Both of these obviously take time, and are slower burn objectives.\n\nIn the meantime, we are running an initial protomje, where Twitter and (and subject to legal/security approval) blog content is manually scraped and uploaded to GCDesk. This content is accessible by way ofpersonalised RSS feeds. Individual users can choose their preferences, in terms ofwhich Twitter accounts and blogs they want to\nfollow, and a personalised RSS feed is generated automatically for them to which they can subscribe.\n\nThis can be used by anyone, and can be accessed from M. Your personal RSS is linked ?om the LOVELY HORSE website.\n\nAs stated previously, this is a manual update at the moment, and will initially be maintained on a best endeavours basis (hopefully roughly daily). Once the architecture comes on line, this will be updated in real time.\nFor any requests for new Twitter feeds you wish to be able to subscribe to, please get in touch.\n\n[in] Current sou rees\n\nCurrently, we're bringing in the following list ofTwitter accounts.

We currently have a list ofaround 60 blog and Twitter sources that have been identified by CD0 and cyber defence experts from Detica, and most of these have been approved for collection by MP-LEG.\nInformation will arrive in unstructured 'information articles'. In the context ofa blog, an article would be apost; on Twitter, an article would be a tweet.\n\nBlog sources:\n\nThese sources have currently been approved by MP-LEG (see spre?sheet in OVER)\n\n0 \n\n0 \n\nI \n. .xml\n\n0 intrepidusgroup/insight/feed\n\nI \nrdierooLorg/feed/\n\n0 \n\nI imthezuk.blogspot.com\n\ndogber1.blogspot_com/\n\n0 \n\n0 blog.mandiant.com\n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n\nblogs.adobe.com/psirt/feed\n\n \n\nThese sources are currently not approved by MP-LEG\n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 securityvulns.com\n\n0 \n\ntargetedemailattacks.tublr.com\n\nTwitter sources:\n\nThe advice from MP-LEG on this issue is that \"provided the accounts you are selecting for acquisition meet the criteria as agreed in the approvals spreadsheet, i.e. those of?academics specialising in the identification and investigation ofvulnerabilities and malware\", there is no need to seek authorisation for each individual Twitter account.\"\nOur selection of Twitter sources is currently as listed above, but will undoubtedly increase over time.\n\nFurther potential sources ofinterest are found at \n\n[eLit] Processing\n\nInitially, these articles get processed into three components:\n\n[ml Content\n\nThe content will be the full textual content ofthe article. This will be stored as some sort in a dambase.\nMetadata\n\nWe would strip memdam from the article such as\n\nAuthor/Source\nDatetime of submission\n\nand used this to update a Source Directory - information about the individual sources. For example:\nAuthor\nI Number ofarticles in LOVELY HORSE\nAverage usefulness rating - see feedback mechanism\nTags ofsubject matter linked with this source? - see indexing\nIndex\nThis is the important bit. The aim is to index the unstructured information so that it can be linked back to\n\nI An analyst?s particular interest\nAs enrichment to an existing investigation\n\nThe proposed idea is to make use of mgging (defining 'indexing' as 'identifying keywords'). Each article would be mgged with information that had been extracted from it. These could be IP addresses, domains, or any text string from within the content ofthe article. Effectively these are the output ofentity extraction, and this list of\ntags would then be associated with that article.\n\nSimilarly, lists of are associated with individual to define their specific interest set.\n[em Horn to generate a pmoimgs?\nWe would need a pot of that becomes our entity set which we're extracting from new articles coming in. How to generate this pot oftags?\nSimple idea would be to regex for IP addresses and domains to start offwith.\nCould index every capimlised word in a blog title.\nCould get to provide a list of keywords they are specifically interested in.\nCould we extract keywords from existing analyst toolsets - for instance, do mg investigations within Palantir?\nshould be encouraged to mg articles they read\nThere is potential to link this entity extraction initiative in with corporate entity extraction tools that may provide more sophisticated matching.\nCould try and analytically identify tags. Whole articles could be tokenized and aword count generated. Ifaparticular term appeared, say, 4 or 5 times in the current week, but not last week, then maybe that's a new trend? In which case we should add this term to the pot ofmgs.\n[eLit] Feedback mechanism\nImportant to allow easy ability to appraise usefulness ofinformation. should be able to like content from whichever interface they're accessing the content. Ifan analyst likes a particular article, tags from that article are automatically added to their personal mg list.\n\nArticles can have a usefulness rating assigned to them - generate some metric on the lines of (number of'likes'/number ofviews). Articles that have a usefulness rating over a specific threshold could be pushed to all An average ofthe usefulness ratings across all articles from one source can be used to appraise different sources -\nalmost becomes a crude 'confidence factor' in the information - should I trust/act upon this information?\n\nedit] Visualisation and Access\nNeed to be different ways access and view this content.\nPalantir - as enrichment to existing investigations. Similarly to the current enrichment helper, any articles that had which are entities within the investigation are ?agged up. The content should then be viewable in a human readable format within Palantir.\nAlerts - should be alerted when a new article is tagged with a tag from their interest set. How should this alerting happen? Email? RSS feed?\nI General search, there should be LOVELY HORSE front end that can be used for to search across the whole repository. Would want to investigate tools that can provide Google-like searching (need to investigate MERA PEAK, NSA's LEXHOUND).\n\nMay need to be a timeframe element in the enrichment, content that is 2 years old may not be relevant.\n\nPOC: (mail \n[elm] Your Thoughts\n\nIfyou've got any thoughts on this initiative, please get in touch either directly to or feel free to edit this section and add them below:\na\n\n0\n\nRetrieved from \n\nViews\n\n \n\nAdditional mtistics\nPersonal tools\n\nNavigation\n\nMain Page\n\nHelp Pages\n\nI WikipediaMirror\nAsk out..\nRandom page\n\nI Recentchanges\n\nRepb?aPrleem\nContacts\n\n0 \n\nSearch\n\nToolbox\n\nWhat links here\nRelated changes\npload ?le\nSW\nPrinmble version\n\nPermanent link\n\nThis page was last modified on 6 February 2012, at 09:40.\n\nThis page has been accessed 538 times.\n\nAll material is UK 7 Crown Coovrightl 2008 or is held under licence from third parties.

Current\nusage statistics quoted are 200K users and 1K servers. When asked about trends, he had no concrete\ndata - Being a non-profit open-source effort, the collector of statistics has not been active recently.\n\n(U) The obligatory ?Anonymity is not equal to and ?Anonymity is not equal to\nSteganography? admonishments were given early on.\n\n(U) Who are TOR Customers?\n\n(U) Mr. Dingledine mentioned that the way TOR is spun is dependent on who the ?spinee? is. Using\nthe typical (in the world), Alice and Bob as communicants, he described several\nAlices:\n\n(U) 1. Blogger Alice, who wants to be able to write to a blog in an anonymous way.\n\n(U) 2. 8 yr. old Alice, who wants to be able to post to sites for children in a way insuring her true\nname and location are not discovered.\n\n(U) 3. Sick Alice, who want to research information on her illness on the Internet while not enabling\nanyone to determine her true name and location.\n\n(U) 4. Consumer Alice, who wants to research possible purchases without having a database of her\nmarketing habits being built without (or with her weak) consent.\n\n(U) 5. Oppressed Alice, who lives in a repressive country (no or limited free speech) and wants to\ntalk about things contrary to her governments positions. The countries he used as examples were\nFrance, Germany (prohibitions on fascist writings?) and the US (not sure what he meant here?).\n\n(U) 6. Turning to ?Business Alice?, we had examples of companies not wanting to give up their\nbusiness secrets to competitors via their Internet usage patterns. An anecdote was given of some\nbusiness getting a different HTML page displayed when the same URL was accessed with and\nwithout TOR.\n\n(U) 7. ?Law Enforcement Alice? was concerned with the ability of anonymous agents/informants to\nreally main anonymous when contacting their law enforcement ties.\n\n(U) Anonymity System Concepts\n\n(U) Running ones own anonymity service vs. Using a 3rd party service: If one uses one?s own\nservice, its pretty obvious who the user is \n\n(U) Low Latency Anonymity Service vs. High Latency Anonymity Service: The difference is in\nhow paranoid someone really is. In a Low Latency Anonymity Service (all common proxies, TOR,\nothers), there is a rerouting through some number of proxies, but there is no attempt to reorder\npackets or artificially introduce latencies. The result is something which can be used for most web\nand instant messaging chat applications with only minimal notice of delays by the user. In a high\nlatency service, proxies attempt to randomly reorder an delay packet so that it is harder to track\n\ntraffic. Such systems are really only useful for such protocols as email.\n\n(U) The most recent and advanced High Latency anonymity service was the /*MixMinion*/ family\nof open source projects. Mr. Dingledine was one of the key developers of these. His opinion is that\nthe very limited utility of such projects has caused them to wither on the vine. He does *not* see\nany major development in such services for other than research in the forseeable future. Another\nkey point is that the degree of anonymity in any system is proportional to the number of users. If\nnoone is using any of the high latency systems, why bother. This proportionality is one of the ideas\nMr. Dingledine refers to as a /tension/ in the world of anonymity systems.\n\n(U) TOR Issues\n\n(U) The short description of TOR for the reader is as follows: The user, via his/her TOR client,\nqueries one of 5 directory servers for the current list of TOR nodes. Using metrics such as\navailability and bandwidth in conjunction with random choice, a set of 3 proxies is chosen for a\n?circuit?. It is this circuit which is used, with a unique layer of on each link, for\nanonymous Internet interactions.\n\n(U) The lifetime of a circuit, a tuneable parameter, is another /tension/, this one specific to TOR.\nThe longer the circuit life, the more various traffic that may transit it, forming a knowable\nrelationship between the traffic streams. Too short of a lifetime means too much time/CPU is spent\nbuilding circuits. The original default lifetime was 30 seconds but is now 10 minutes. Everything is\ntweakable in TOR, so a user if free to choose his/her own circuit lifetime. But this is dangerous, as a\nunique circuit lifetime could easily become a user identification feature \n\n(U) Mr. Dingeldine was asked about the concrete choice of a 3-long circuit. This is unlikely to\nchange soon, as it appears to be a very suitable tradeoff.\n\n(U) The mention of SOCKS proxies, such as /*Privoxy*/ as a bump in the\n\nchain before TOR was mentioned. These proxies can intercept and cleanup things such as cookies to\nfurther help anonymity.\n\n(U) The current ?owner? of TOR is torproject.org, a US registerd non-profit organization, of\nwhich Mr. Dingledine is a principal. In addition to specific technology issues such as scaling, other\ncategories of work are:\n\n(U) 1. Usability (Targetting the ability of other than tech-savvy users to embrace the technology)\n2. Incentives (Trying to get more people to run TOR servers)\n3. Design for Scalability/Decentralization\n\n3a. Regarding scalability of the TOR network, Mr. Dingledine proffered the guess that 2000-3000 is\na rough upper limit on the number of nodes in the pool before a new topology may be advised.\n\n3b. Decentralization means less reliance on a very small set of trusted Directory Servers (curently 5)\n4. Continued research on attacks and the mitigation thereof.\n\n5. Continued provision of documentation and user technical support.\n\n"

    "doc_text": "Malware from the Five Eyes\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Five Eyes commonly share tools and techniques, and in some occasions also collectively develop new\nones, such as the WARRIORPRIDE malware framework.\n\nWARRIORPRIDE, as all the malware programs we discovered in Five Eyes' arsenal, is very flexible and\nversatile. Among the many interception modules WARRIORPRIDE is provided with, the technical research\nteam has obtained a copy of QWERTY - WARRIORPRIDE's component designed to invisibly record all key\nstrokes from an infected Windows computer - from the Snowden Archive.\n\nDer Spiegel is now releasing QWERTY to the public in order to foster further research and investigations. Der\nSpiegel believes that the release of the malware, which appears to be several years old and likely replaced by\nmore recent variations, will not affect any ongoing operation.\n\nTechnical Preview\n\nQWERTY is a keylogger, a plugin for the WARRIORPRIDE malware framework, that is designed to intercept all\nkeyboard keys pressed by the victim and record them for later inspection.\n\nIts structure is really simple. It's made of a core component called a driver that interfaces directly\nwith Windows' keyboard manager, and a library which interacts with the driver to retrieve the keys\npressed by the user and keep track of them in a file.\n\nQWERTY is composed of the following binary files:\n\n- 20120.dll\n- 20121 .dll\n- 20123.sys\n\nEach one of these components is provided with a structured XML document that defines all available\ncommands as well as dependencies.\n\nWe learned from Snowden documents that WARRIORPRIDE is the implementation of a CNE library called\nWzowski. In some of the XML documents from QWERTY we find it referenced as a dependency WzowskiLib\nv2.1 along with a more generic v2.10.\n\nAdditionally, we can find hardcoded in one of the binaries the following string:\n\n\n\nThis strongly confirms the connection to WARRIORPRIDE and possibly suggests a relation to the Defense\nSignals Directorate (DSD), now just known as Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), one of the Five Eyes.\n\nFile\n\nThe malware samples are contained in a password-protected zip archive (password is ?infected\") attached here\nencoded in base64.\n\nTo avoid problems with copy and pasting that occur with some PDF readers, the following command line can\nbe used on a Linux system to easily extract the zip file from this PDF:\n\npdftotext filename.pdf -lgrep -v greplgrep -A 1000ltr -d '\\014'lsed -e -d malware.zip\n\nThe resulting zip file should have the sha1sum \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9C Opol \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 eHhUAz i 0VHV4 6AMAAH2 LY I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 qu5 \n4VAM4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL5D2 7GDQ2HV8 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5xqt88+IBoMi9E li  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt9KZij \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 9 \n\n\n\n\n\nIZ 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here's a success story demonstrating that we are indeed\nseeing concrete bene?ts right now from \"mission blending\":\n\n \n\nYears ago it would have been hard to imagine that NSA's defensive\nside of the house (Information Assurance) and its offensive (SIGINT) mission could\nwork together and allow NSA to collect other people's SIGINT, but that is exactly\nwhat is happening as we speak.\n\nOur story begins in July 2009 at the Threat Operations Center\n(NTOC) -- an organization with a blended foreign intelligence (SIGINT) and\ninformation assurance mission. While analyzing malicious ?les targeting \nusers, NTOC personnel at Fort Meade discovered an IP address of a command-\nand-control node being used by Asia-based hackers associated with an organized\nseries of intrusions known as BYZANTINE RAPTOR. (Note this success story\nstarted with a tip from the computer-network defense side of the house.)\n\n \n\nWith this IP address in hand, (speci?cally SID's Tailored\nAccess Operations were able to get sustained collection on this C2\nnode. Consequently, NTOC-Hawaii has enjoyed visibility into data that BYZANTINE\nRAPTOR is routing through the node. This data includes tasking and collection\nfrom a Chinese computer-network exploitation (CNE) operation against the United\nNations.\n\nThis collection occasionally includes documents China has stolen\nfrom the United Nations network. Since NSA has sustained collection on this C2\nnode, we can intercept these same documents. In effect, NSA is able to tap into\nChinese SIGINT collection -- a phenomenon called \"Fourth Party \n\nThe collection is sent to the PINWALE raw-traf?c database for\ncorporate storage and retrieval. Whenever new documents are sent to PINWALE,\nNTOC-Hawaii tips off target in S2. As a result, S2's UN target of?ce has\nissued three SIGINT reports based on this \"Fourth Party collection,\" all dealing\nwith high-interest, high-pro?le current events.\n\nThis is a tremendous example of the entire NSA -- the offensive and\ndefensive missions, headquarters and ?eld -- truly operating as a single enterprise,\nwith and collectors connecting data in non-traditional ways to get\nintelligence to our customers.\n\n \n\n(U) Notes:\n\nRef: DIRgram-290 (\"Transformation 2.0 - The Next Step\"), the ?rst\n\"strategic thrust.\" Also, for background on what drove mission blending, see this\nSIDtodav interview with former IAD Chief- question 4.\n\nSee a related article for background on 4th Party collection.\n\n20f3\n\nSIDToday - NSA's Offensive and Defensive Missions: The Twain Have Met\n\nSIDtoday\narticles may not be\nrepublished or\nreposted outside\nwithout the\nconsent of 50121\n\n    \n\nDYNAMIC PAGE --\nHIGHEST POSSIBLE\nCLASSIFICATION IS\n\nTOP SECRET SI TK\nREL TO USA AUS\nCAN GBR NZL\nDERIVED FROM:\n1-52,\nDATED 08 JAN 2007\nDECLASSIFY ON:\n20320108\n\n30f3\n\n"

The exploitation activity may be state-\nsponsored or opportunistic, but when one target nation is gathering data on\nanother target nation, the Intelligence Community (IC) may be able to use that\ninformation.\n\nL) Initial development in this arena has focused on developing capability\nagainst keyboard loggers (keyloggers), speci?cally attempts by the Kurdistan\nDemocratic Party against several targets. A keylogger is software or hardware that\nhas been installed, either co-operatively or maliciously, on a computer to capture\nkey strokes, screen captures, chats, passwords, logins, etc. Keylogger activity is\nquite prevalent and is being used to identify activity on computers related to IC\ntargets.\n\nMHS is interested not only in the data that is being ex-?ltrated, but\nalso in who is installing the keylogging software to initiate that ex-?ltration. Some\ninitial work has already identi?ed a network believed to be associated with the\nKurdistan Security Service. Research has shown that CNE activities targeting\ncivilian and government individuals and computer networks are taking place in\n\nseveral locations: the northern Iraq city of Erbil,1 various locations in Iran, and\nsome Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs computers.\n\nThe method of exploitation involves the use of a commercial keylogger\ncalled \"Perfect Keylogger.\" This keylogger records data from the computer it is\n\ninstalled on and emails the data to a con?gurable email address.2 The data from\nthese activities are being emailed to accounts that trace back to terminals believed\nto be associated with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).\n\nImage represents a sampling of the data taken from keylogger reports\nbetween the last week ofNovember and the ?rst week ofDecember 2007.\n\nL) The computer networks being targeted appear to be internet caf?s in\nboth Iran and Iraq. Email addresses from at least ?ve different private domains are\nreceiving the keylogger reports. These domains are all registered in Erbil, Iraq. In\nall cases, the targeted individuals appear to be in?uential and were probably\nchosen because they have links with the Kurdistan Regional Government. At least\none Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs computer has also been compromised by this\nCNE activity. The keylogger reports that are targeting individuals are being sent to\ngmail accounts, which may indicate that the person receiving the ex-?ltrated data\nwants to be able to access it from different locations. The email addresses of the\nperson(s) receiving the keylogger reports have been associated to MAC addresses\nwhich are believed to belong to the KDP.\n\nKeyloggers can give information such as login/passwords,\nadditional email addresses, phone numbers, and documents that reside on the\nvictim's computer that might never have been seen via traditional SIGINT.\n\nInformation on the CNE activity by the KDP has been passed to the in\n\n20f3\n\nSlDToday - '4th Party Collection': Taking Advantage of Non-Partner Computer Network Exploitation Activity\n\nproduction at MH S, the Kurd TOPI (Target Of?ce of Primary Interest) at NSA\nGeorgia, and the Threat Operations Center.\n\nFor additional information on \"4th party collection,\" contact the MHS\nCNO team at\n\n(U) Notes:\n\n \n\n1 (U) Also called Irbil and Arbil\n\nCon?gurable - Registered domain on the internet that allows the owner to\nmake their own email addresses.\n\nSIDtoday\narticles may not be\nrepublished or\nreposted outside\nwithout the\n\nconsent of 50121\n\n \n\nDYNAMIC PAGE --\nHIGHEST POSSIBLE\nCLASSIFICATION IS\n\nTOP SECRET SI TK\nREL TO USA AUS\nCAN GBR NZL\nDERIVED FROM:\n1-52,\nDATED 08 JAN 2007\nDECLASSIFY ON:\n20320108\n\n30f3\n\n"

Round Table\n\nYes. There was a project that I was working last year with\nregard to the South Korean CNE program. While we aren't super interested\nin SK (things changed a bit when they started targeting us a bit more), we\nwere interested in North Korea and SK puts a lot of resources against them.\nAt that point, our access to NK was next to nothing but we were able to make\nsome inroads to the SK CNE program. We found a few instances where there\nwere NK of?cials with SK implants on their boxes, so we got on the ex?l\npoints, and sucked back the data. Thats fourth party. However,\nsome of the individuals that SK was targeting were also part of the NK CNE\nprogram. So I guess that would be the ?fth party collect you were talking\nabout. But once that started happening, we ramped up efforts to target NK\nourselves (as you dont want to rely on an untrusted actor to do your work for\nyou). But some of the work that was done there was able to help us gain\naccess. I know of another instance (I will be more vague\nbecause I believe there are more compartments involved and parts are\nprobably NF) where there was an actor we were going against. We realized\nthere was another actor that was also going against them and having great\nsuccess because of a 0 day they wrotepassive and\nwere able to re?purpose it. Big win.

This interface will be deployed to support Tailored Access\nOperations (TAO) On-Net operations, specifically implants that are required to exfiltrate\ncollected network packets, but due to implant processing and bandwidth constraints are\nrequired to utilize a low overhead egress protocol.\n\nThis document defines the interface requirement that the Common Data Receptor\nand implant must support to enable successful reception of raw data packets sent by the\nimplant. It includes conceptual data flow diagrams and network diagrams to define the\nsystem. It also contains detailed data format examples, data field definitions, and a\ndescription of the protocol.\n\n(U FOUO) Reference Documents\n\nFLAXENPRECEPT External (source-to-CDR) Interface Control Document (Front End\nEICD), Doc 16 June 2003.\n\nFLAXENPRECEPT External Data Flow Corporate) Interface Control\nDocument (Back End EICD), Doc \n\nSHELLGREY binary metadata tag standard:?\n\n(U) Background\n\nThe Common Data Receptor (CDR) is a DNT-designed system to perform the data\nreception portion of what is commonly termed a ?Listening Post.? The CDR supports a\ncommon interface that DNT developers use for data formatting and reception. In addition,\nthe Common Data Receptor concept emphasizes the use of a Data Receptor, Operations\nManager, and Network Manager vice a Listening Post.\n\n(SliSl/le) The introduction of the FASHIONCLEFT protocol is necessary because without\nthe FASHIONCLEFT protocol, the implant-to-CDR communication previously did not\nhandle raw IP data packets. In addition, an implant previously had no way to deal with the\nchallenge of processing streaming data while minimizing the computing overhead\nassociated with encapsulating and the data. This new protocol provides the\ndeveloper a mechanism to specify the level of implemented in the implant as a\nprecursor to data transmission.\n\n(SliSl/le) The FASHIONCLEFT protocol supports the passing of metadata securely and\nwith authentication.\n\n(SliSl/le) The metadata is used to support the reconstruction of IP packets and when\napplicable to convey information about the session.\n\nLast Saved 4/17/2013 09:08:00 PM\n\nPage 1 0f 25 Last Pnhfed 9/15/2009 02:15:00 PM\n\nVINYLSEAT\n(Email)\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOLYMPUS\n(Files)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nUMTEDRAKE\n(Emaili'Filesi'. . .)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n[Streaming Packets)\n\n1.4\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COMINT X1\n\n\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\n(S/lSI/le) The CDR Architecture includes the Outer SURPASSPIN, Inner SURPASSPIN\nand SEAGULLFARO In addition, a one-way transfer device ROOTKNOT\n(composed of Pitcher, Catcher, and their one-way link) supplants the air gap previously\nemployed (that required manual transfer by diskette). In order to support this configuration,\nDNT has been working closely with the Remote Operations Center (ROC) to design and\nbuild FIGBUILD (an external mission network) and OPTICPINCH (an internal mission\nnetwork).\n\nFigure 1.3-1 below shows the Common Data Receptor Architecture as described in\nthe referenced FLAXENPRECEPT EICDs.\n\nThe interfaces supported by the CDR must also support the separation of\nclassi?ed and unclassified processing. Classified information, such as egress data and\nmetadata must be protected while on the unclassified network side before passing through\nthe one-way link. This interface also supports the CDR protection of classified information.\n\nFigure 1.3?1 Common Data Receptor Architecture\n\nCommon Data Receptor\n\nOPTICPINCH\n\n3 . .\n2 Link . 5 -\n\nROOHCNOT SLRPASSPIN\nPitcher Catcher I Inner\nin .\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nng\n(via diskette}\n\n \n\nCollection Logs\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nO?i ce (1 Target Pursuit\n(Forensics Lab)\n\nftargets\n\n \n\nMarual\nProcessing and\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInterface Description\n\nThis interface provides TAO developers a low overheard solution to exfiltrate\nstreaming data, typically associated with implants that collect raw packets from the target\nenvironment, while providing the appropriate metadata and authentication. The basic\ndesign principle behind this low overhead approach is to redirect a copy or clone of the\noriginal packet to another host, or listening post (in this case the CDR). In-order to redirect\na packet, features of the copy of the packet must be altered particularly the source and\ndestination addresses, and possibly the port numbers.\n\nDRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\nLast Saved 4/1 7/2013 09:08:00 PM\n\nPage 2 0f 25 Last Printed 5/15/2009 02:15-00 PM\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\nThis interface is designed to support the reception of \"cloned\" packets and their\nassociated metadata originating from implants, while supporting authentication of the\negress data and correlation of received packets to the appropriate metadata. To provide\ngreater flexibility for the implant, several configurable levels of are supported.\n\nThe following assumptions are made:\n\n- This interface supports egress of data and does not support a command and\ncontrol channel.\n\n- This interface is used by implants which for valid reasons are unable to implement\negress methods that require greater resources from the target, such as\nencapsulation.\n\n- Egress data must be associated with authenticated metadata.\n\n- This interface may not be suitable for all boundary defenses that could be\nencountered within a target environment. Extensibility has been designed to allow\nadditional packet selection algorithms to be added, such that future changes to skirt\nother defenses can be readily included.\n\nThis interface implements four functions:\n\n- Transmission of session announcements,\n\n- Transmission of metadata,\n\n- Transmission of data packets,\n\n- Reconstruction of data packets using the metadata, and\n\n- Reconstruction of sessions using metadata to track and collate data packets\nbelonging to a particular session.\n\nDuring session establishment, an implant authenticates itself to the CDR and\nrequests the CDR to begin reception of data packets that belong to this session. As part of\nestablishing the session, metadata about the session is passed, along with metadata that\nthe CDR requires to assign data packets to the session and collate data packets within the\nsession. The session establishment function uses the FOGYNULL protocol family to\nauthenticate and securely pass metadata, packet collation information and data packet\nstatus.\n\nThere are several methods that an implant could use to collate data packets to the\nappropriate session, but only one method can be used in any session. The implant picks\nthe appropriate Exfil Type either \"Packet\" or ?Session,? and either ex?ltrates one\nmodified copy of a source packet per source packet, or assembles the source data\npayloads from several source packets into one packet to be exfiltrated. The\nFASHIONCLEFT interface design allows these methods to be extensible, so additional\nmethods can later be developed and included to meet operational constraints imposed by\nboundary defenses.\n\nThe data packets are generally a copy of a packet that was collected, and had its\ndestination address changed to send it to the CDR. Additional fields might have been\naltered to support one of the methods of assigning data packets to a session and collating\ndata within a session. If selected during the session establishment, the payload section of\nthe packet may be using the mode specified by the FASHIONCLEFT protocol\nmode selection in the FOGYNULL implant header.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COM NT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\n Page 3 or 26 \n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\nFigure 1.4-1 below shows how the FASHIONCLEFT protocol modifies the conceptual\ndiagram of the Common Data Receptor Architecture as described in the referenced\nFLAXENPRECEPT EICDs.

FASHIONCLEFT Protocol Details I\n\nMetadata is used to announce the initiation of a session, to describe the\nsession, and to provide original packet reconstruction information.\n\n \n\nFrom the point of view of an implant, a streaming data transmission session is\naccomplished in two steps, first sending the session announcement metadata,\nfollowed by the continuous sending of the streaming data packets.\n\n2.1. FASHIONCLEFT Session Announcement\n\nFASHIONCLEFT session announcement metadata announces the initiation of\na session, describes the session, and conveys data packet reconstruction (and\nassociation) information to enable data packets and sessions to be reconstructed after\ncollection.\n\n2.1.1. Session Announcement Description\n\nFASHIONCLEFT adds two new fields in the FOGYNULL protocol\ninfrastructure header to proclaim that data packets containing streaming data are to be\nsent using the FASHIONCLEFT protocol (Packet-IF-Selector, Packet-IF-Data); and\nadds a new OpCode tag (0X09) plus new mode tags in the FOGYNULL\nprotocol implant header to indicate that raw packets will be exfiltrated and the extent to\nwhich they are being \n\nFASHIONCLEFT also adds new tags in the SHELLGREY protocol that fully\ncharacterize the original source and original destination of streaming data packets that\nfollow. In addition, FASHIONCLEFT uses the SHELLGREY metadata tag to\nindicate whether the target data will be exfiltrated as:\n\na ?Packet data? (one exfil data packet per cloned target packet) or\n\na ?Session data? (each exfil data packet contains target data payload that may\nhave been captured prior to being encapsulated by the target source into\nmultiple packets for transmission)\n\nExample: Session Announcement\n\n\nDeployment-Id 0x00\nTarg ei-ld 0xa1a293a4\nImplant-Id 0xb1b2\nPacket-lF?Selector 0x01\nPacket-lF?Data \n\n \n\nIMEHDB\nOpcode 0x09\nInst-Id 0x00\nImplant-Var Oxdl\n0x02\n\nFOGYNU LL\n\n\nMetaData-Len ML\nData-Len 0\n\n \n\nFUNN ELAPS\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na METADATA-BLK \nor Exfil-Id 0x00000092\n9 Exfil-Type Packet ML\nTime-of-lmercept Ewes\nClle\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COMINT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\nLast Saved 4/1 7/2013 09:08:00 PM\nPage 6 of 26 Last aned 6/15/2009 02500 PM\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\nThe structure of session announcement is comprised of the FOGYNULL\n\nHeaders, both the Infrastructure and Implants headers; followed by SHELLGREY\n\nMeta-data, format within a FUNNELAPS protocol with no data.

These packets have a valid IP header, to allow the packet to be routed to the LP\naddress. Other bytes within this packet may be altered to allow the packet to pass the\ntarget?s egress filters, and/or satisfy a specific packet selection criterion. The SHELLGREY\ntags contained within the Metadata Block specify reconstruction and commands\nthat are processed in the order in which they occur, to transform the received Data Packet\ninto the desired data format for further processing. The reconstruction result is therefore\nhighly dependent on the specific reconstruction tags used and the order in which they\noccur. For example, as shown below, the received Data Packet always contains an IP\nheader, but the SHELLGREY tag can be used to remove the\nIP4 header. Subsequent SHELLGREY commands could then operate on either the\nremaining ?Packet buffer? layer, or on the Transport layer (if it exists).\n\nTable 2.3.1-1 (U) Packet Layers\n\n \n\nPacket data\n\n \n\nIP header (mandatory) IP data (optional)\nTransport header (optional Transport data (optional)\n\n\n2.3.2 Data Packet \n\nPackets will be munged, or The mode and the\nportion of the packet that is are indicated in the Metadata Block using\nSHELLGREY tags.

This method provides no reliable transport.

This method offers not only reliable network transport,\nby allows acknowledgement feedback from the LP, making this method reliable.\n\nUsing a steganographic tunnel the SA would hide within a higher-level network protocol.\nThis method offers both improved OPSEC from detection, but also offers reliable transport by\nallowing acknowledgement feedback from the LP.\n\nTransmission of data packets would be similar to raw IP packet by its nature, but only the\ndestination IP address is predetermined, all ports and ICMP packets are allowed.\n\nSelection of method and parameters would be subject to the security posture imposed by a\ntarget environment.\n\n2.5. Constraints and Timing Issues\n\nThe FASHIONCLEFT protocol is designed to operate over an unreliable\nnetwork protocol where only communication from the sender is possible. Unless the\nSession Announcement could occur using a reliable network protocol, and even a\nbidirectional protocol, the data packets are clearly unreliable. To \nFASHIONCLEFT communications between the sender and receiver entities under all\nconditions, certain constraints and timing issues must be observed. Basically, the\nFASHIONCLEFT sender (implant) has an active role for maintaining proper\nwhile the receiver (LP) has a passive role. What follows is a list of\nconditions; follow by a discussion of each.\n\n- Sending of the Session Announcements\nNew or Continuation of a terminated Session\nTermination of Session\nSending Data Packets to Session Announcement ports\nDuplicate Data Packets\nSimultaneous Exfil of Multiple Sessions\nEarly Termination\n\nSENDING OF THE SESSION ANNOUCEMNETS\n\nGenerally the Session Announcement (SA) would be send prior to data\npackets be sent. If the SA data is sent using an unreliable network transport, it may be lost\nin transit. To overcome this, the SA data should be sent more than once. Since data\npackets may arrive prior to SA data, the receiver will buffer all received IP packets for\nfifteen (15) minutes. Once a valid SA arrives, the buffer will be scanned for possible data\npackets. To insure at least one SA arrives, more than three should be sent within the 15-\nminute time window, unless the SA is sent using a reliable protocol. In addition, for cases\nwhere the duration of exfiltration of data packets is short and the SA path is unreliable, the\nsender should also make at least three (3) attempts to send the SA.\n\nTERMINATION OF SESSION\n\nOnce the session is established, the LP will terminate the session and stop\nlooking for and forward data packets to the backend when the following two conditions are\n\nmet:\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COM NT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\nPage 1 7 of 26 \n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\n1. No data packet has arrived for ten (10) minutes.\n2. No SA has arrived for ten (10) minutes.\n\nNEW OR CONTINUATION OF A TERMINATED SESSION\n\nWhen an authenticated SA arrives, the packet selection criteria, as well as the\nFOGYNULL Identification fields will be used to determine if the packet is new or existing\ncollection. If new the FASHIONCLEFT receptor will begin data packet collection. If it is\nredundant, the SA is ignored.\n\nIf the SA that arrives is in actuality for a session that has been terminated, the\nFASHIONCLEF receptor will be tasked to start data packet collection as if it was a new\nsession. The inner portion of the CDR will rejoin these disjoint captures of the same\nsession, by using the Meta-data tag and FOGYNULL identifiers, provided that\nno more than fifteen (15) minutes between termination of the last session and the start of\nthe next session with the same EXFIL-ID from the implant.\n\nTo insure separate session are not inadvertently joined by the CDR, Implants\nshould allow at least sixty (60) minutes, between the reuse of EXIL-ID values.\n\n \n\nSENDING DATA PACKETS TO SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT PORTS\n\nTo minimize testing every packet, for session announcements, being sent to\nthe FASHIONCLEFT receptor, only certain destination ports will be monitored for session\nAnnouncements. These ports can be arbitrarily configured to address the needs of specific\ndeployed implants. If an implant chooses, or is required to by conditions imposed by the\ntarget environment, it may send data packets to these ports as well. Packets that match a\ndata packet selection criterion are not checked for session announcements. Therefore,\nimplants that desire to send announcements to the same port as data packets, must\nchoose packet selection criteria carefully.\n\nDUPLICATE DATA PACKETS\n\nImplants that desire to send duplicate data packets are permitted, and may be\ndesirable in some cases to insure that critical portions of the session are received by the\nFASHIOINCLEFT receptor. Duplicate data packets will occur as an artifact of packet\nsniffing by default. Data packets that are either duplicated by design or by coincidence\ngenerally will be removed by post processing during session reconstruction.\n\nSIMULTANEOUS EXFIL OF MULTIPLE SESSIONS\n\nImplants that desire to exfiltrate multiple disjoint sessions simultaneously, or\neven sessions back-to-back must utilize the EXFIL-ID in conjunction with the packet\nselection criteria. The EXFIL-ID is used to identify disjoint sessions, while a packet\nselection criterion is used to associate data packets to a particular session. Implants must\nchoose both such that both are unique per session, and the above conditions are met.\n\nEARLY TERMINATION\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COMINT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\n\n1 st 5 4/1 7/2013 09:03:00 PM\nPage 18 of 26 La; may; 021500 PM\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\nIf an implant sends a session announcement that has a new EXFIL-ID but has\na packet selection criterion that is identical to an existing criterion, the previous session will\nbe terminated, and all new data packets that satisfy the criterion will be associated to the\n\nnew EXFIL-ID.\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COMINT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\nPage 19 of 26 \n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\n3. Packet Selection Algorithms I\n\n3.1. Description\n\nThis section describes the methods used to associate meta-data with non-\nencapsulated egress packets that are transmitted independently from the data that is\ndesired to be ex?ltrated. Specifically, it addresses allowable contents for the \"Packet-I/F-\nSelector\" and \"Packet-I/F-Data\" fields of the FOGYNULL Infrastructure Header (INF-HDR).\nThe following table identifies the specific values for the \"Packet-I/F-Selector\" field to\nselect which algorithm to be used to do an association. This indicates whether the\n\"Packet-I/F-Data? field is used to convey parameters for the selected algorithm. The\n\"Packet-I/F-Data\" field can be up to 32 bytes in length.\n\n \n\noTable 3.1-1.

So, for the non-null types specified above, the\ncorresponding \"Packet-I/F-Data\" fields are as follows:\n\noTable 3.1-2.

The content of \"Packet-I/F-\nData\" is unused.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COMINT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\n\n1 st 5 4/1 7/2013 09:03:00 PM\nPage 20 of 26 La; may; 021500 PM\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\n3.2.2 (U) Generic Pattern Matching, [0x01]\n\nThis method implements a generic static pattern matching against specified bytes within\nthe received packets. The content of ?Packet-I/F-Data\" contains a?nite number of matching rules.\nThese matching rules allow a pattern match against specified bytes following the start of an IP\nheader; thus, they can include checks against bytes in the headers. (The rules could\ninclude checks against other bytes, but the header checks would probably be the norm.) Thus, this\nselector would allow checks against the IP Identifier field as well as elements such as IP addresses,\nTCP window size, TCP urgent data size, ports, etc. This method is fairly general and should be able\nto cover any case in which portions of these headers contain fixed bytes.\n\nThe purpose of the data field is to specify the particular byte offsets and patterns to be used for\nmatching against received packets. A non-zero number of \"pattern blocks\" must thus follow the\nlength field (which specifies the number of bytes in the ?pattern blocks\"). Each \"pattern block\"\nconsists of three bytes as described below. For this method, a received packet must match the\ncriteria specified within of the pattern blocks. Using a 1-byte length and 3 bytes/block implies\nthere can be at most 10 \"pattern blocks\" within the 32-byte ?Packet-I/F-Data\" field. In addition, using\na 7-bit offset implies that the largest offset (from the start of the IP header) is 127 bytes. The format\nof this field is:\n\n- <1-byte length> <pattern block block n>\n- A pattern block has the following format:\n\n<1-byte offset> - offset from start of IP header or Transport Protocol header.\n\n0 Bit 0: (LSbit) indicates start position, if 0 use start of header, if 1 use\nthe start of Transport Protocol header.\n\n0 Bit 1-7: offset value (multiply desired offset by 2 to shift into bits 1-7)\n<1-byte mask> - mask to be used with pattern\n<1-byte pattern> - pattern to be matched\nThus, to perform a pattern block check, verify the following equality:\nPacket [IP_Header_Offset <offset>] <mask> <pattern> <mask>\n\n(The above assumes that enough packet bytes are available. For error checking purposes, the\nlength field should always be a multiple of the pattern block size, i.e. 3, and a pattern byte bit-wised\nand - ed with the mask byte should always yield the pattern byte.)\n\nAs an example, suppose one wants to match any packet having an IP ID field of 0x1234. (The IP ID\nfield is 2 bytes long, occurring at offsets 4 and 5 bytes from the start of the IP Header.) Then, the\nfollowing data ?eld would be used:\n\n- <1-byte length>: 6\n\nPattern block: 1\n\n- <1-byte offset>: 8 \n- <1-byte mask>: \n\n- <1-byte pattern>: 0x12\n- Pattern block 2\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COM NT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\nLast Saved 4/1 7/2013 09:03:00 PM\n\nPage 21 of 26 Last PnMed 65/15/2009 02:15:00 PM\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\n- <1-byte offset>: 10 \n- <1-byte mask>: \n- <1-byte pattern>: 0x34\n\n3.2.3 (U) FIxed IP4 Field MatChingi \n\nThis method implements a static pattern matching against a specified subset of\nheader fields. This method is geared toward the use of the typical 5-tuple of\nfields used by IP and TCP (or UDP). In addition, it has the capability to handle both sides\nof the traffic, i.e. it allows the source/destination address and port ?elds to be toggled.\n\nNote: The two-sided source/destination toggling described below should normally\nnot be used. Normally only a single sided pattern should be specified. If togging is used,\nthere will be no way for the SHELLGRE reconstruction tags to correctiy reconstruct the IP\nor Transport Header, since the same reconstruction tags would be applied for both\ndirections (to. A and A would be received as A and X, but would\nreconstructed using the same value for X). The toggling mode can only be used if the IP\nand Transport headers will be dropped.\n\nThe contents of the data field are used to specify the subset of fields and\nassociated patterns for matching against received packets. The rationale for having this\nmethod is the belief that it may often be the case that collection can be done based on the\nstandard 5-tuple used for uniqueness. For this selector, the data field will\nalways contain the following 24 bytes:\n\n- <1-byte length> - number of bytes following this field (23)\n- <1-byte mask> - indicates fields/toggles to be used\n\na Bit 0: (<mask> 0x01) if set, match on protocol field\n\na Bit 1: (<mask> 0x02) if set, match on destination IP address [Note: there is\nonly one destination IP address, and this match is not useful when the\ndestination IP address must be overwritten with a particular forwarding IP\naddress]\n\na Bit 2: (<mask> 0x04) if set, match on source IP address field, use first source\nIP field if bit 5 of mask is unset; use both source IP fields if bit 5 of mask is set\n\na Bit 3: (<mask> 0x08) if set, match on destination port field(s) -- only use first\ndestination port field if bit 6 of mask is unset; use both destination port ?elds if\nbit 6 of mask is set; [Note: if set, then there's an implied match of either UDP or\nTCP on IP protocol ?eld]\n\na Bit 4: (<mask> 0x10) if set, match on source port field(s) --only use ?rst\nsource port field if bit 7 of mask is unset; use both source port fields if bit 7 of\nmask is set [Note: if set, then there's an implied match of either UDP or TCP\non IP protocol ?eld]\n\na Bit 5: (<mask> 0x20) if set, then allow source IP address to toggle between\nthe two alternatives\n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COM NT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\n Page 22 or 26 testis:arrested\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\n- Bit 6: (<mask> 0x40) if set, then allow destination ports to toggle between\nthe two alternatives\n\n- Bit 7: (<mask> 0x80) if set, then allow source ports to toggle between the two\nalternatives\n\n- <2-byte Protocol> - IP protocol field used if mask bit 0 is set\n\n- <4-byte - destination IP address used if mask bit 1 is set\n\n- <4-byte - source IP address #1 used if mask bit 2 is set\n\n- <4-byte - source IP address #2 used if mask bits 2 5 are set\n\n- <2-byte DstPort1> - destination port #1 used if mask bit 3 is set\n\n- <2-byte DstPort2> - destination port #2 used if mask bits 3 6 are\nset\n\n- <2-byte SrcPort1> - source port #1 used if mask bit 4 is set\n- <2-byte SrcPort2> - source port #2 used if mask bits 4 7 are set\n\nWhile this method allows filtering on a particular 5-tuple (or subset), it's also\nintended to handle both sides of a connection. Given that the destination IP\naddress will typically be fixed (to be the forwarding IP address), the only fields that can\ntoggle are the source IP address, destination and source ports. This method allows any or\nall of those fields to toggle. When toggling checks are being done, only the corresponding\ntoggling ?elds should be used, e.g. DstPortl, and SrcPortl would be three values\nof the 5-tuple (if all are being used and all are allowed to toggle) and DstPort2, and\nSrcPort2 would be the three toggled values of the 5-tuple (if all are being used and all are\nallowed to toggle).\n\n3.2.3.1.

It\nwould match either of the following 5-tuples:\n\nTCP: 1.2.3.4/9 \n(Protocol: DstIP/DstPortl)\n\nTCP: 5.6.7.8/10 \n(Protocol: DstIP/DstPort2)\n\nTo indicate a match on just the IP addresses, the following data field could be used:\n\n<1-byte length>: 23\n<1-byte mask>: 0x26\n<2-byte Protocol>: <unused>\n<4-byte A.B.C.D\n<4-byte 1.2.3.4\n<4-byte 5.6.7.8\n<2-byte DstPort1>: <unused>\n<2-byte DstPort2>: <unused>\n<2-byte SrcPort1>: <unused>\n<2-byte SrcPort2>: <unused>\nThe above data field would match any IP packet having either of the following two\nIP pairs:\n1.2.3.4 A.B.C.D\n5.6.7.8 A.B.C.D\n\nFinally, suppose that forwarded packets were to use a spoofed source IP address\nof E.F.G.H and a destination port of 7777, but the source port would be allowed to toggle.\nIn that case, the following could be used:\n\n<1-byte length>: 23\n<1-byte mask>: 0x5F\n<2-byte Protocol>: TCP\n<4-byte A.B.C.D\n<4-byte E.F.G.H\n<4-byte <unused>\n<2-byte DstPort1>: 7777\n<2-byte DstPort2>: <unused>\n<2-byte SrcPort1>: 9\n<2-byte SrcPort2>: 10\n\nCLASSIFICATION:\n\nTOP SECRET COMINT X1\n\nDRV FM: 123-2\n\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\n\nLast Saved 4/17/2013 09:08:00 PM\n\nLast Printed 5/15/2009 02:15:00 PM\n\nPage 24 of 26\n\nClassification: Top Secret COMINT X1\n\nThis would match either:\nTCP: \n\nTCP: \n\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COM NT X1 DRV FM: 123-2\nDated: 24 Feb 98\nDECL ON: X1\nLast Saved 4/1 7/2013 09:08:00 PM\n\nPage 25 of 26 Last PnMed 02:15:00 PM\n\nClassification: TOP COMINT X1\n\nAppendix A Glossary I\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(U) Glossary of Terms Used\nGlossary Term Meaning Source Remarks\nExfiltrate To extract [data] through a target's defenses.\n\n \n\nA software or hardware subcomponent that is\nsurreptitiously emplaced in a target\n\nImplant environment (CPU, router, etc) to pass\nselected information back to NSA, where it is\nprocessed for analysis.\n\n \n\nIP Internet protocol\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: All abbreviations Acronyms are\nexpanded where they are first used.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast Saved 4/17/2013 09:08:00 PM\n\nPage A-l of 1 Last Pmred 02:15:00 PM\n\n"

The FELONYCROWBAR GUI and build scripts\nhandle some aspects of con?guration, such as which SBZ modules to include,\nbut it also needs the DND to con?gure most aspects of the communications\nlinks. For an upgrade, an old DND can be modi?ed by hand, but for a new\nbuild, a new DND will need to be generated in the NCC (with some changes by\nhand). Once the core and \"bin\" customization SBZ ?les are generated (usually\na zip ?le output from FELONYCROWBAR), an interactive operator can deploy\nthese to the shooter box.\n\n(U) Infrastructure Components\nFREEFLOW\n\n \n \n\nThere are four operational FREEFLOW threads (plus one for\nPAS SAGEHILL testing):\n\nI Thread A, the original FREEFLOW thread (early 2008), associated with\nthe old covert infrastructure \n\nI Thread B, the QUANTUM thread\n\nI Thread C, FINGERGNOME high?to?low transfer\n\nI Thread D, the new FREEFLOW 2.0 thread, associated with new covert\ninfrastructure (FROZENEARTH).\n\nThe FREEFLOW Con?uence page \nhas a good overview picture, especially showing the\ndifferences between the old FREEFLOW (1.0, the purplish?gray area) and the\nnew FREEFLOW (2.0, the yellow area). The QUANTUM thread is 1.0 for now,\nbut will eventually be upgraded and this whole process will change.\n\nFREEFLOW components important for understanding QUANTUM shooters are\ndescribed below as they apply to the shooter build process, and a good\noverview of the QUANTUM infrastructure can be found here\n\nCHIMNEYPOOL\n\n \n\n20f6\n\nQUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - WikiInfo\n\nCHIMNEYPOOL uses its own version of RPC (CHM RPC) for\n\ncommunications, which ride on the ERIEZERAMP Network Stack\n. \n\ncompliant nodes are referred to by their four?byte EREIZERAMP (ERZ)\naddresses, which are usually represented in hex.\n\nLinks are half?duplex comms paths that need to be con?gured\nfor two CHM nodes to be able to talk. These can be or \nand are usually spit out correctly by the NCC DND, along with the Security\nAssociations that allow them to communicate with the NCC (keys are\ngenerated by the NCC). To communicate with TURBINE, the SBZ also needs to\nhave two additional Security Associations con?gured one to communicate\nwith SURPLUSHANGAR and one for HANGARSURPLUS.\n\nMIT) usually con?gures the side, which generates the keys. You'll need\nto con?gure SAs to match -keys, which can be done either by modifying\nthe DND, or post?deployment via commands directly to the SBZ via NCC (see\n\nDave).\n\nMore details on the comms\ncan be found here \n\n(U) Diodes \n\n\nSURPLUSHANGAR\nto?Low), and HANGARSURPLUS\n\nwhich each have three parts:\n- Hi Prox connects to ISLANDTRANSPORT \nand converts to CHIMNEYPOOL messages.\n\nI Packager (high?to?low only)\nI Low Proxy: talks \n\n(U) NCC\n\nThe GENIE Network Con?guration Center (NCC) manages\nCHIMNEYPOOL comms links for all STRAITBIZARRE implants, via\nMIDDLEMAN. Information on the NCC is often out of date (the \"new\" NCC will\nbe on the high side and will hopefully be easier to updategenerate a DND if you can't modify an old con?g, either from?\nor from /targets/zombiearmy to ?nd the one the operator put on ox. ou\nalso need the NCC to manage the links.\n\nGateway \n\n \n\nWeb Sniper Gateways (WSGs) sit between MIDDLEMAN and the\n\n30f6\n\nQUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - WikiInfo\n\nQUANTUM shooters. Information about these is NOEORN and is found in a\nspreadsheet updated by? You'll need to con?gure the shooter to\nsend comms via the nearest gateway choose the gateway that has the lowest\nlatency to the shooter, based on the results of latency tests (which are not\nexpected to change frequently).\n\nTURBINE\nThe Con?uence TURBINE \n\n\npage describes what happens when an SBZ calls back.\n\n(U) How To\n\nConnecting to the QUANTUM NCC\n\nI Your WAITAUTO box needs to be able to talk to the QUANTUM NCC\n. You may need an ticket to get the ?rewall to allow\nthis connection.\nI Use Putty to SSH to the NCC box (username: ncc_user; email \n- for password) with the following options:\nI Connection SSH check box to \"Enable X11 forwarding\"\nI Connection SSH display location: set this to <Your\nWAITAUTO IP address>=0\nI cd /opt/ncc/ and run User name (either user1 or user2)\ndepends on who else is using the box check with the POCs above.\n\nGetting a DND from the NCC\n\nI Follow instructions in the document in References, or con?rm that the\nsettings are correct.\n\nI Once your changes have been saved, in the terminal window, run the\nfollowing:\n\nkd /opt/ncc/uti1\n\nWebSnipe <your node cover term> Iocalhost (where \"WebSnipe\" is the target cover td\n\nI The resulting DND will be in /tmp (WebSnipe_<node cover\nCopy this to a thumb drive and upload to\nRS S.\n\nGetting a DND from [targets for an upgrade\nI Check either EELONYCROWBAR or /targets/ZOMBIEARMY/<node>\n\ndate>/techdata if they have it there from a previous op.

How do I get a linkEndId?\n\n\nI\n\n:Choose the appropriate send and receive nodes for your link, \"Interface Provider?:Cidr, \"Proceduresget/change the link state?\n\n\n:getLinkState to check state. indicate the link is off; indicate the link is on.

More information\ncan be found on the DSD wiki, but it's a bit ugly at this point.\n\n0 REL) Determined that it was a combination of the volume\nshadow copy and deleted entries in the shadow copy that were causing\nmy recovery woes. As a result of the shadow copy having large chunks of\nMFT data in it, and much of these records still being mostly correct,\nrecovery programs were able to reconstruct most of the system drive. I\nadded functionality to PITIEDFOOL to overwrite the contents of the\nshadow copy on each partition encountered.\n\n0 REL) Now that I was overwriting large chunks of data for\nevery partition, I could no longer ignore the performance issues with\nwriting to a disk one sector at a time. I refactored my code to overwrite in\nblocks configurable by a pre?processor definition and sped up execution\nabout 15?fold, with the possiblity of it going even faster with increased\nmemory usage.\n\n0 (TS SI REL) After all this I tested PITIEDFOOL within FUZZYEBOLA\nand it worked ?awlessly. I took a build of FUZZYEBOLA from last\nmonth, and without recompiling inserted the PITIEDFOOL binary with\nconfiguration details to execute it at a certain time. At that time I saw the\nprocess usage increase (from 0% to around and a few minutes\nlater the system rebooted and didn't come back up. Running a file\nrecovery tool over the entire drive yielded some files (from scraping\nheaders) but nearly the entire contents of the drive were irrecoverable,\nand if it had been configured to securely wipe every sector on the drive\nafter killing the MFT and VSS it wouldn't have been able to recover\nanything at all. Success!\n\n0 Documented my work.\n\nPANT SPARTY\n\n0 (TS SI REL) PANT SPARTY is a backdoor in the SSH daemon for\nbased on portable. It allows a public key to be embedded\nin the binary and will then always grant a root login shell if\npresented with the proper key pair for that key. In other words, it behaves\nas if the given key is in .ssh/authorized_keys.\n\n0 (TS SI REL) Currently DSD uses authorized_keys as a quick?and?easy\nmethod of persistence against certain targets. In most cases this\n\n2of5\n\nSNIPS of SIGINT (U) Notes for June 2012\n\nworks, but it obviously isn't very stealthy and can run into problems if\nthat file is deleted or the SSH configuration changes to not use it. The goal\nfor this project was to provide the same level of persistence but embedded\nin the binary itself (obviously, assuming root access, as before).\n\n0 (TS SI REL) By adding my own check in several key places within the\nSSH code I was able to grant authorization to a key embedded in the\nbinary without too much trouble. The hard part came in granting that\nuser root privileges even if the configuration specifically banned root\nlogin. That was achieved by setting a flag in the authorization context\nwithin the server that essentially said \"this is our backdoor, let it happen,\noh and stop logging also.\"\n\n0 REL) Then I wanted to have it so if you provide a normal\nusername as a login, it still grants you a root shell. SSH has a lot of checks\nto make sure you can't switch usernames in the middle of a login (go\n?gure) so this was a bit tricky to bypass. Ultimately I was able to use the\nsame flag as the previous step, and just had to put checks for it in other\nplaces.\n\n0 REL) More fun was to be had when I wanted to allow an\narbitrary username to be provided one that doesn't exist on the\nsystem) while still allowing for root login. This led to all sorts of problems\nwhere I didn't even get a valid authorization context at all, and I couldn't\nmanually call the function to get one for root because the connection is\na de?privileged child process, so I had to force?feed it a fake one for root.\nOf course, the force?fed hash for root doesn't match the entry in passwd,\nso I had to throw in another check there to return true if it's the backdoor.\nAnd there's all sorts of fun happening with pre?auth where I had to revert\nthe authorization context back to its original value to postpone its\nprocessing (a standard authorization step in some cases) and then\nproperly update it to root during the actual authorization step later on.\nOnce I got this working, however, a user is able to run \"ssh\nabcdefg@target\" and the target's logs only show \"Invalid username\nabcdefg\" without the follow?on message of \"Accepted publickey for root\nfrom 10.0.0.1 port 55000 ssh2\". Presenting a valid username leads to the\nonly logged output being that the public key check failed.\n\n0 SI REL) I set my new implant development PR on this project! My\nprevious record was 3 days for DIRTYDEEDS, but I finished this in 2.\nTechnically I had it working in a day, but it wasn't what I considered\nreleasable, so I'll have to wait for some other opportunity to present itself\nso I can achieve the feat of an implant?in?a?day.\n\nAwards/Recognition\n\n(U Letter of Appreciation from_ Director DSD\n\n30f5\n\nSNIPS of SIGINT (U) NoteS for June 2012\n\n(U Letter of Appreciation fr0_ Chief SUSLOC\n\n(U FOUO) SUSLOC coin\nBriefings and demonstrations given\n\n(S REL) Briefed the US.

BACKGROUND\n\n1. Every Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod touch has a unique hardware\nidentifier called the Apple UDID. The UDID is a 40 character hex string\n(160 bits) that seems to be a hash of the IMEI, serial number and\nthe Bluetooth and WiFi MAC addresses. The UDID is available to\ndevelopers of applications for these devices, and it is used to identify a\ngiven device. As highlighted in the UDID is seen in multiple apps and\ncan be used to allow target tracking or be used to correlate with other\npersonal identifiers.\n\n2. The Mobile Theme has invested a large amount of research into iPhone\napps and metadata anal sis over the last year accumulating with a\ndetailed report done by in October 2009 and 29 SEM rules\ncreated by ICTR-MCT These rules have used to extract iPhone\nmetadata for a number of apps and in particular the Unique Device\nIdentifier (UDID) from any carrier being processed using DEBIT CARDs.\nFurther TDI rules are being developed by GTE that will in the future\nextract UDID events from carriers processed through the MVR system.\nThe resulting events have then been used to populate both research and\ncorporate QFDs (Query Focused Datasets) such as MUTANT BROTH\nand AUTOASSOC and will eventually form the basis of mobile\ncorrelations in HARD ASSOC.\n\n3. Initially, an exploit was developed by the Joint Mobile\nExploitation Team for iPhone that was to be delivered to the target\nphone when syncing with an exploited end point machine. This was\nsuccessful for a BROKER target and resulted in the extraction of SMS,\ncall logs and contact details. After this initial trial, CNE and SD undertook\nwork to discover other single end points seen syncing with iPhones.\n\n4. At HANDEX 2010 (handset exploitation workshop) in August, various\naspects of the iPhone OS were investigated for potential vulnerabilities.\n\nPage 2 of 11\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n\nC.\n\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n12th November 2010\n\nUsing an open source PDF vulnerability when using the Safari browser,\nJoint Mobile Exploitation Team were able to develop an\nexploit to deliver a WARRIORPRIDE implant to a target test phone.\nFurther, investigation, liaison and testing with the CNE QUANTUM team\nresulted in approval for the implant to be deployed against QUANTUM\niPhone targets.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF ANALYSIS\n\nCNE Endpoint\n\nAs part of the SD Mobile Exploitation theme to identify further end point\nmachines that had been seen syncing with iPhones, a survey was\nundertaken by CNE and TAO to scan all target end point machines for\nthe appropriate iPhone registry keys. Scanning of all CNE stored single\nend point (SEPs) registry keys on particular process IDs resulted in 9\nCNE endpoints seen this year sync'd with iPhones. The resulting Unique\nDevice Identifiers (UDID) were extracted from the registry keys and ran\nin MUTANT BROTH and AUTOASSOC, resulting in 6 correlations with\neither iPhone Safari user agents or the iPhone Mail app seen in passive\ncoHecdon.\n\nA CNE end point operation \n\nEPILSON had resulted in access to a windows end point machine\n. A scan of this machine's re istr keys resulted in UDID\n. As can be seen, the\n\nUDID has been seen with the Admob SEM rule type and with the Apple-\nIMEI-URI TDI type. Admob is the largest mobile advertising network\nallowing games publishers to embed adverts and therefore receive\nrevenue from a number of different brands.

Bulk extraction of targets over a three-week period from\nBLACKHOLE by ICTR resulted in a large number of iPhone targets and\nfurther queries in Xkeyscore resulted in others. Others were passed from\ndiscussions with various IPTs and two were also passed from TAO\ncontacts.\n\nIn total 44 selectors were checked to verify that the correct user agent\nwas present. Of these 44 selectors, 41 were yahoo selectors and 3 gmail\nselectors. Of these 26 were seen with a valid iPhone Safari user agent\nas shown in Figure 8. A summary of OS versions seen with target\nphones is shown in Table 1 with OS highlighted in red currently\nexploited. These are 3_1_2, 3_1_3 and 4_0_1.

A total of 7 targets were seen\nusing the Yahoo Mobile Messenger app.\n\nThe target with target selector\n\nFor all target selectors seen with valid Safari user-agents, further\nMUTANT BROTH, AUTOASSOC and MARINA queries were performed\nto discover any other possible OS versions seen with the selector.\nMARINA profile queries were performed resulting in the OS version\nbeing returned within the MachinelD field. The resulting user-agents,\ntime/date, bearer, IP and any other associated selectors are shown in\nthe iPhone target list Associated selectors are either from MUTANT\nBROTH, AUTOASSOC or seen directly as stated in BROADOAK. All\nYahoo B-cookies as shown in Figure 8 were run in MUTANT BROTH to\nconfirm their uniqueness with the iPhone and target yahoo selectors.\n\nOPERATIONAL OUTCOME\n\nThe QUANTUM redirect and PDF Safari browser exploit was developed\nto work against 3_1_2, 3_1_3 and 4_0_1 Safari OS versions. Of the 26\ntargets seen with valid exploitable OS version, 5 were added to the\nQUANTUM system for targetting.\n\nOnce notified, GCHQ IPTs either added the target to existing CNE\nsection 7 warrants as defined in or developed targetting aids as\ndefined in and wrote the appropriate warrant. The resulting section 7\nwarrants were approved by IPT team leaders and signed off by the CNE\nLegal Team. Three NSA targets were discovered and were added by\nCNE Legal Team to the Partner Agreement Forms to allow exploitation.\n\nInitially,?yahoo sele and B-\n\nctor\ncookie was put on cover on \n\nactive recently on a iPhone Safari browser to access his yahoo account,\npreferring instead to use the inbuilt iPhone Mail client or his iPad. Three\nQUANTUM attempts resulted in no redirect to SHORTSHEET server for\n\nPage 7 of 11\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n\n30.\n\n31.\n\n32.\n\n33.\n\n34.\n\n35.\n\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n12th November 2010\n\n- and after further analysis it was discovered that this selector was\nnot-but an associate. It was removed from tasking.\n\nTarget analysis and warrant was completed for a further five targets and\na successful QUANTUM redirect and the PDF exploit was delivered for\nPFVT658) on the 30th of October. The resulting\nWARRIORPRIDE install was also performed and beaconed on the 2nd of\nNovember. The target phone was shown to be jailbroken and on the 3rd\nof November content was successfully extracted from the phone and\nwas available in Looking Glass. This is highlighted in Appendix with\nthe resulting iPhone directory structure presented how it appears in\nLooking Glass. The WARRIORPRIDE exploit has resulted in extraction\nof the target?s address book, sms, call logs, notes, WLAN logs,\nbookmarks, map query history, Safari browsing history and some\nimages. Detailed analysis of extracted files will be covered in a further\nreport.\n\nA successful redirect to in October was\nperformed but due to what is believed to be Javascript being disabled on\nthe phone the firmware type of the phone could not be confirmed to\nenable the first stage implant. This initial survey of the firmware type has\nnow been removed after discussions within CNE but the target has not\nbeen seen recently on his iPhone for exploitation. The two other targets\ntasked for QUANTUM have failed to be seen recently in collect.\n\nCurrently, there are four CNE Single End Point machines that have been\nidentified with recently sync?d iPhone targets. The most recent being an\nOVERLIT target seen on 29/09/10. These targets are being monitored\nby CNE and will have the SLIDE exploit installed to allow implant of\nWARRIORPRIDE when the iPhone is sync?d with the existing SEP\nmachine.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWith the analysis of the UDIDs on target machines and correlation in\npassive collection with known target yahoo selectors, the UDID can be\nused to correlate iPhone handset to end point machine and tasked\nyahoo selectors. The UDID can be used for realtime tracking of target\niPhones and could in theory be used as a selector for QUANTUM events\nwhere other traditional selectors (yahoo-Y/B cookie etc) are not present.\nOf course an exploit for the application would have to be written which is\nnot trivial.\n\nIt is not possible at this time to take the UDID and reverse engineer the\nSHA-1 HASH to discover the IMEI, MAC addresses and serial number.\n\nFurther work is ongoing to identify targets of interest that are suitable for\nthe QUANTUM exploitation. Development and monitoring of current\n\nidentified tar ets is still being done. Discovery of an associated IMEI for\ni will help in firmware identification and exploitation of this\ntarget.\n\nPage 8 of 11\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n\n36.\n\n37.\n\n38.\n\n39.\n\n40.\n\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n12th November 2010\n\nCNE are now conducting surveys of all target machines registry\nkeys for iPhone UDIDs. A similar tipping mechanism for all BROADOAK\nhits needs to be completed using a XKS workflow. Hopefully, other\ntargets will be added for QUANTUM exploitation or discovered on new\nCNE SEPs in the future and a successful exploit of a target phone\nperformed.\n\nFURTHER WORK\n\nAnalysis of three PRESTON accesses has resulted in the identification\nof a number of iPhone targets. Development work against at least three\ntarget sets is needed with extraction of appropriate UDIDs and iTunes\nXDSID values. Suitable section 5 warrants need to be in place to pursue\nthese end point machines, once CNE have gained access and the\nresulting target iPhones have been discovered.\n\nWith further work being undertaken by B88 and TECA on the\nWHIPSAW redirect and exploitation server, it should be possible in the\ncoming months to implant directly the target iPhone. However, the\nWHIPSAW exploit is only available via the tasked ADSL line.\n\nAn automatic implantation of SLIDE on to an iPhone is needed.\nCurrently this is manual process requiring a CNE operator to be\nconnected to the endpoint machine whilst the target is syncing the end\npoint machine and iPhone.\n\nA larger number of iPhone TDIs need to be written to allow further\nevents to be populated into the QFDs allowing correlations with other\ntarget selectors. This will also enable further real-time tracking of target\nidentifiers.\n\nPage 9 of 11\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n12th November 2010\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nTargeting aid\n\n \n\nIMEI for target selector \nactive and an iPhone?\n\n \n\nC2C target selector \nyahoo, gmail, hotmail, UDID\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nTelephony selector seen\ncorrelated in MARINA,\nSOCIAL ANTHROPOID\nor \n\n  \n      \n\nUnlikely due to the lack of\ncorrelated mobile bearer collect\nbut worth checking\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nC2C target selector active on\nany iPhone user agent?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMozilIa/5.0 (iPhone; \nCPU iPhone 08\nTarget high enough priority\n\nfor CNE End Point op?\nDiscuss with Team Leadej\n\n \n\n \n\nand Tech Ex\n\n \n\n \n\nPut together CNE 11HSEP Targeting \n\n\n\nTech Ex QC and draft section\n7 warrant or add to existing\n\n\n\nEmail pack to CNESEPP iPhone OS 3_1_2, 3_1_3, 4_0_1\nthen add to QUANTUM\n\nEnd Point OP check for UDID\nin any registry keys\n\n \n\n \n\nMust have appropriate bearers on cover\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSLIDE run and WARRIOR PRIDE\ninstalled on handset\n\n \n\n \n\nPage 10 of 11\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n\nTOP SECRET STRAP1\n12??

We are tasked to remotely degrade or\ndestroy opponent computers, routers, servers and network enabled devices\nby attacking the hardware using low?level programming. It would be\nexpected that our interns would learn to:\n\nWrite drivers for LINUX, Windows, Solaris, or Apple OS.\n\n0 Use SVN in a group environment.\n\n0 Reverse engineer embedded systems\n\n0 Deliver code that conforms to Op?sec and deniability\nrequirements.\n\n0 Recover equipment that has been attacked.\n\nWork with multiple to build something unique.\n\n0 Developing an attacker's mind set.\n\nFVEY) POLITERAIN always has a backlog of smaller attacks\nthan those listed below that need to be productized. We are also always open\nfor ideas but our focus is on ?rmware, BIOS, BUS or driver level attacks. The\nprojects below an intern could be expected to produce results in 4?6 months.\nMost of the projects are unique enough to allow for results to be briefed or\npublished in a classi?ed venue.\n\n[edit] (U) PASSIONATEPOLKA\n\nhave discovered a way that may be able to remotely\nbrick network cards. We need someone to perform research and develop a\ndeployable tool. Intern would have access to driver level developers, mentors\n\n20f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\n8: SMEs but would own the project and be responsible for it.\n\n[edit] (U) ARGYLEALIEN\n\nis a security feature built into many modern\nhard?drives that allows for zeroization. We want to use this feature to cause\nthe loss of data. Intern would be working closely with a POLITERAIN\nengineer to develop a solution that would work on multiple vendors\nleveraging Persistence divisions SMEs, investigating via experimentation.\nIntern would learn about hard?drive recovery, reverse engineering,\nhard?drive architecture and much more.\n\n[edit] (U) BARNFIRE\n\nattack effort will erase the BIOS on a brand of\nservers that act as a backbone to many rival governments. An intern working\non this project would need to be a *nix expert with experience with low?level\ndevelopment experience of multiple types and reverse engineering\nexperience. Intern would be working and learning from SMEs during this\ndevelopment. First tour interns would not be considered for this project.\n\n[edit] (U) Hard Drive Recovery\n\nFVEY) When someone really needs the information off of a\ndamaged hard drive, they call Persistence. This would be a unique tour\nlearning from a world?class expert how to ?x hardware and ?rmware\nproblems. You would be working on targets, extracting data, troubleshooting\nhardware, rebuilding SCSI arrays, and using analytical engineering skill to\nproduce real collection. Position requires good hearing for some of the\ntroubleshooting. Intern should know how to solder.\n\n[edit] (U) IRATEMONK\nSSD Support\n\nIntegrate SSD research into IRATEMONK products. This will\ninvolve 4 different parts:\n\nI Leveraging research to create ARM?based SSD implant.\nThis works involves reverse engineering SSD ?rmware and creating \nand ARM assembly code to place inside of a ?rmware image to\nimplement the IRATEMONK algorithm.\n\n0 Create version of the IMBIOS code that supports the SSD\nimplant. This code runs on the x86 host and involves writing both and\n\n30f13\n\n83285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nx86 assembly. This work will involve interacting with the ?rmware\nimplant as well as the code that IMBIOS bootstraps (SIERRAMIST).\n\nAdd support for the SSD to WICKEDVICAR.\nWICKEDVICAR is the remote tool used to perform remote survey and\ninstallation. This code is and will involve interacting with the\n?rmware implant from a Windows OS.\n\n0 Add the SSD vendor support to the IRATEMONK ?rmware\nand implant database tool. This code is mostly python code that\ninteracts with a drive via a Linux driver.\n\nThe SSD support for IRATEMONK project currently offers the\ngreatest variety of new work that an intern might be able to do.\n\n[edit] Covert Storage Product\n\nCreate a covert storage product that is enabled from a hard\ndrive ?rmware modi?cation. The idea would be to modify the ?rmware of a\nparticular hard drive so that it normally only recognizes say half of its\navailable space. It would report this size back to the operating system and\nnot provide any way to access the additional space. The ?rmware would have\na special hook inside of it that on receipt of some custom ATA command, it\nwould \"unlock\" the rest of the drive on the next boot of the drive. When\ncovert storage is locked, only 1 partition would be present on the drive.\nWhen unlocked, the ?rmware would ?x up the partition table to account for\nthe second hidden partition whose space is now available on the drive. When\n?nished with covert storage, a special command can be sent back to the\ndrive that will lock the drive again. On the next boot, the ?rmware will hide\nthe extra space and ?x up the partition table so only 1 partition exists.\n\n[edit] SADDLEBACK\n\nUtilizing a hard drive's serial port, create a ?rmware implant\nthat has the ability to pass to and from an implant running in the operating\nsystem. In practice, the serial port will be connected to a short hop radio that\ncan communicate with another radio in a system. Doing a ?rmware\nmodi?cation eliminates the need to tap the SATA bus as was done on other\nversions of SADDLEBACK. Performing ?rmware modi?cation will allow for a\nsmaller SADDLEBACK in the form of a laptop drive as opposed to the current\nversion which only comes in a a 3.5 inch version.\n\n[edit] ALTEREDCARBON Support\n\nDevelop IRATEMONK implants for the newest Seagate drives\nincluding their hybrid drive products. This work will primarily be a reverse\nengineering effort, but if successful will require updates to both IMBIOS (x86\ncode, and assembly), WICKEDVICAR (x86, and SPITEFULANGEL\n\n40f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\n(python).\n\n[edit] FAKEDOUBT Support\n\nCreate an IRATEMONK implementation for ARM?based Hitachi\ndrives. This includes a ?rmware implant, IMBIOS code, and WICKEDVICAR\nand SPITEFULANGEL support.\n\n[edit] PLUCKHAGEN Support\n\nCreate an IRATEMONK implementation for ARM?based Fujitsu\ndrives. This includes a ?rmware implant, IMBIOS code, and WICKEDVICAR\nand SPITEFULANGEL support.\n\n[edit] EASYKRAKEN Support\n\nAdd more drive support for ARM?based Samsung drives.\n\n[edit] USB Hard Drive\nPersistence\n\nDevelop a capability to install a hard drive implant on a USB\nhard drive. Since external hard drives are not normally boot from, the new\nimplant will need to be an improved version of MADBISHOP so the hard\ndrive implant will have the ability to manipulate the ?le system of the drive\ninside of the ?rmware itself. Development would consist of 3 main\ndevelopment areas:\n\nI Reliable, robust, and portable NTFS code. Other ?le\nsystems could also be looked into such as FAT, EXT2, etc.\n\nHard drive implant\n\nI Remote installation over USB\n\n[ec?t] IRATEMONK on\nServer/RAID Systems\n\nInvestigate the feasibility of developing a hard drive\npersistence implant for Server/RAID systems. This will primarily involve\ninvestigating what ATA commands are allowed through various RAID\ncontrollers. Also, coming up with a scheme to handle different RAID\ncon?gurations will be needed since the data on the drives will differ\ndepending on the the RAID setup. It will be important to examine how RAID\ncontrollers interact the drives and where data (especially the MBR) is stored.\nIf feasible, this investigation could lead to the extension of \n\n50f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nhard drive implants into server spaces which provide increased covert\nstorage and the capability to keep persistence logs which currently aren't\navailable on BIOS only techniques.\n\n[edit] Enhancment of testing\ncapabilities\n\nIRATEMONK makes use of ROGUESAMURAI and actual\nhardware to perform its testing. The downside of testing with actual\nhardware is that testing takes many hours/days to complete. Someone with\nthe right level of test development experience can help to improve the\ncurrent IRATEMONK testing strategy.\n\n[edit] \n(SED) Persistence\n\nSED drives provide additional security measures which often\nthwart IRATEMONK developer efforts to modify the ?rmware on these\ndrives. I highly skilled intern with reverse engineering skills and\nunderstanding of security in computing systems would be invaluable in\ntackling one of the persistence divisions more dif?cult problems.\n\n[edit] OS Execution\n\nWhile a lot of work in the Persistence Division involves\nmodifying ?rmware, there is still a large need for OS kernel and user?mode\nexpertise. The ?rmware modi?cation done at the lowest levels of hardware\nneeds a way to obtain execution inside of a running OS so that a DNT\npayload can be either given execution or installed.\n\n[edit] CASTLECRASHER\n\nCASTLECRASHER is the primary technique used in executing\nDNT Windows payloads from all payload persistence techniques \nIRATEMONK and SIERRAMISTFREE). It is all Windows native mode code\nbuilt using Visual Studio. CASTLECRASHER has many advanced techniques\nin it including thread injection and anti?stack backtracing. In many cases,\nCASTLECRASHER is closer to the DNT style kernel work than it is to\ntraditional Persistence work. While the current version is quite robust, there\nare several features that need to be added:\n\n0 Currently, CASTLECRASHER doesn't work against\nsystems with 360 Safe installed. We need to ?nd a way around this even\nif it involves using the older Windows service method of execution. This\n\n60f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nwill more than likely require a refactoring of how the con?guration data\nof CASTLECRASHER is stored.\n\nDevelop an automated test suite using the Persistence\nDivision's ROGUE SAMURAI test framework to provide more robust\ntesting for this important project.\n\n[edit] Alternate Windows\nExecution Technique\n\nCurrently, CASTLECRASHER is the only production quality\nWindows execution technique that Payload Persistence techniques have.\nAnother mechanism to execute DNT payloads is needed. Most pre?boot\nPersistence techniques only have the ability to in?uence an OS through\nmodi?cations to the target ?le system. Work needs to be done to investigate\nother ways to get execution inside of Windows. This work will start looking at\nother techniques that have been provided to the Persistence Division from\nother partners. The feasibility of these techniques should be assessed. If\nfeasible, the technique should be productized into a deployable solution.\n\n[edit] Mac OSX Execution\nTechnique\n\nResearch needs to be done to investigate different ways that a\npre?boot Persistence technique that can modify the target ?le system can get\nexecution inside of OSX. Maybe start?up scripts can be modi?ed or special\n?les can be added that will get executed. In order for Payload Persistence to\nwork against OSX, a execution technique is needed.\n\n[edit] (U)\n\n\n[edit] (U) Extensibility Application\n\nCreate a new extensibility application that checks for a ?le on\nthe ?le system that it will run to update the SIERRAMIST partition. This\napplication would replace the current one and would have list of con?gurable\n?le paths to check. This could be written for both SIERRAMIST and\nJUMPDOLLAR. Create a ROGUE SAMURAI test suite to test all aspects of this\n\n\n\n[edit] (U) MOPNGO Application\n\n70f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nUpdate the MOPNGO application to remove the buffer over?ow\nissue it has when more than 512 characters are con?gured. Also, port this\napplication to JUMPDOLLAR. Create a ROGUESAMURAI test suite to test the\napplication. Look into creating unit tests as well.\n\n[edit] DOS Driver\n\nThe MX team has requested an upgrade of their DOS\ndriver for their DOS?based thumb drives used in interdiction deployments.\nThe newest FSM should be compiled into a DOS driver for their use. This\nproblem will be solved with the creation of a MKUSB utility for\nJUMPDOLLAR.\n\n[edit] (U) Full Featured Shell\n\nA full featured shell should be written (particularly for\nJUMPDOLLAR). The ability to run scripts and have some sort of ?ow control\nlogic would be desirable. This could eventually be used by the MX team as a\nmeans to deploy implants. They have expressed a desire to have one\nenvironment that can work on a Mac, Linux, or a Windows machine. Provided\nwe have the ?le system support, this could eventually provide them what\nthey want.\n\n[edit] Windows Registry\nRead/\\Nrite Capability\n\nCreate the ability from to be able\nto read and write the Windows registry. This will provide new capability to\napps to do a whole host of new things. It may be possible to install\nVALIDATOR manually instead of relying on its installers. This work may also\nallow some IT Geo applications as well if we can tweak some keys.\n\n[edit] EFI Module\n\nBuild an EFI module out of apps\nthat can be loaded via normal EFI mechanisms including an EFI shell. This is\nsimilar to what Sandia can do with their MOUSETRAP implant. This work\ncould provide a new mechanism to achieve persistence and might prove to be\neasier than current patching techniques.\n\n[94m] Linux App\n\nRewrite the Linux App to be con?gurable and add logging into\nit for use with IRATEMONK. Integrate build into BORGERKING. Investigate\n\n80f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nwhether or not ROGUESAMURAI can be used to test.\n\n[edit] File System Support\n\nThe following ?le systems need support by\n\n\n[edit] \nThis ?le system is slated to become the default in Fedora Core\n17 or 18. Work can begin on supporting this now, however. This is applicable\n\nprimarily for JUMPDOLLAR, but maybe SIERRAMIST as well.\n\n[edit] LVM\n\n \n\nBack port changes of the LVM code in JUMPDOLLAR's EXT4\nFSM to SIERRAMIST's EXT3.\n\n[edit] EXT4\nBack port JUMPDOLLAR's EXT4 FSM to SIERRAMIST.\n\n[edit] \n\n \n\nCreate UPS and ZFS FSMs \n\n[edit] BERSERKR\n\nBERSERKR is a persistent backdoor that is implanted into the\nBIOS and runs from SMM. Although the core of the code is stable, there are\nalways new requirements against which to develop. This includes new\nnetwork interface card parasitic drivers as well as applications.\n\nSome notable applications that need development:\n\n0 KIRKBOMB Windows kernel examination to detect\nloaded drivers, running processes as well. There is a prototype which\nworks on Windows 7, this needs to work on XP and 2008 including\n64?bit systems.\n\n0 SODAPRESSED Linux application persistence. Given a\nrunning installation of Linux, install some application or inject\nsomething into memory which will. This currently works on certain\nversions of Linux without SELinux enabled.\n\nThere may also be requirements in the near future for:\n\n90f13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nBENTWHISTLE A collection tool that runs from\nBERSERKR.\n\nBERSERKR is often looking to expand its target support. A big\nway this is done is via adding network card support. Currently, BERSERKR\ndoes not support any wireless network cards.\n\n[edit] GOPHERRAGE\n\nGOPHERRAGE is a project that seeks to develop a hypervisor\nimplant that would leverage both AMD and Intel's virtualization technology\nin order to provide both DNT implant persistence capabilities and a\npersistent back door.\n\nDevelop a hypervisor implant that would leverage both Intel's\nand AMDs virtualization technology in order to provide both DNT implant\npersistence capabilities and a persistent back door access. The idea would be\nsimilar to what BERSERKR can do from SMM in that it should be able to use\n\"the machine's network interface card (NIC) to communicate independently\nof the host operating system Also, this hypervisor implant should have\nfull read/write access of host memory so it will be possible to change Host\nOS behavior in ways that could allow code execution, OS injection, system\nsurvye, VM break?in, etc.\n\nGOPHERRAGE is the Persistence Division's pilot program to\napply industry best practices and agile development processes to internal\nprojects. To this end, the project is managed via the Scrum process. Test\nDriven Development (TDD) practices are used as well in an effort to reduce\ncode defects. The project also is looking to incorporate ideas from DNT such\nas their SCube build environment.\n\n[edit] Windows Tools\n[edit] WISTFULTOLL\n\nWISTFULTOLL is the premiere target survey tool for Windows\nthat runs on almost all targets automatically. It brings back information\nabout the target system's machine and operating system that is invaluable\nfor both the Persistence Division and enterprise wide. New features\nneed to be added to WI STFULTOLL as well as it being refactored.\n\n[edit] CENTRICDUD\n\nCENTRICDUD is a tool to read and writes bytes in the CMOS.\n\n \n\n10 of 13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nIt needs to be rewritten and productized so that it can be incorporated into a\nproper UR plug?in. The driver associated with this tool also needs to be\nredone as it is being ?agged by PSPs for unknown reasons. This tool is used\nboth by the BIOS team as well as the IT Geo team.\n\n[edit] STYLISHCHAMP\n\nSTYLISHCHAMP is a tool that can create a HPA on a hard drive\nand then provide raw reads and writes to this area. This tool should\nincorporate latest TWISTEDKILT code so that it can support SATA drives.\nThis will allow SWAP to be used on newer systems. Currently, only IDE drives\nare used.\n\n[edit] Network\nInfrastructure\n\nTORNSTEAK is a persistence solution for two ?rewall devices\nfrom a particular vendor. We need to port TORNSTEAK from the existing two\n?rewalls to several more from the same vendor. This persistence effort would\nuse one's reverse engineering, computer architecture, programming and\nassembly language coding skills.\n\nRetrieved from\n\nTOP TO USA, FVEY\n\nDerived From: SI Classi?cation Guide, 02?01, Dated: 20060711\nand 1?52, Dated: 20070108\n\nDeclassify On: 20320108\n\n11 of 13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nRead\n0 Edit\n0 View history\n\nActions\n\n0 Move\n- atch\n0 Tag this page\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n \n\nNavigation\n\n0 Main Pa \n\nCommunitv portal\n0 Recent changes\n\n0 Random a \n\nHel\n\nToolbox\n\nWhat links here\n0 Related changes\n- Trackback\n\n0 load ?le\n\n0 ecial a es\n\n- Printable version\n0 Permanent link\n\nsocial software tools\n\n0 |ournalNSA\nTapioca\n\nConnexions\nLINKUP\n\nace\n\n0 Round Table\n0 WikiInfo?NF\n\npartner wikis\n\nIntelli edia\nCSEC wiki\n\nGo I Search\n\n12 of 13\n\nS3285/InternProjects - WikiInfo\n\nDerived From: SI Classi?cation Guide, 02?01, Dated: 20060711\nand 1?52, Dated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20320108\n\nTOP TO USA, FVEY\nThe accredited security level of this system is: TOP \n\nTO USA, FVEY\n\n13 of 13\n\n"

    "doc_text": "TOP T//l\\l 1 23\n\nCNE Presence in CT10 Status Report\n\nAuthors:\n\nSNIP Intern\n1LT\n\n(UIIFOUO) Executive Summary\n\nUSA, FVEY) This paper discusses the work completed as of 1 April\n2008 on the inclusion of CNE data into the CT10 Pilot Project. engaged two\nfronts in this effort. First, was the acquisition and alerting of active SIGINT into\nCT10. Second, was the design of an extension to the current CT10 data model to\nsupport further analytic development of CNE data. As a result of this work, CT10\nnow supports alerting of the establishment of new TAO points of presence on the\nInternet with respect to certain exploitation methodologies. Additionally, this\npaved the road with internal and external partners for the continued development\nof the CT10 CNE data model extension.\n\nUSA, FVEY) Specific conclusions and recommendations are\ncontained at the close of this paper. However, three key points underpin a\nmajority of the information in this paper:\n\n0 Priority support to CT10 data acquisition efforts.\n\n- Further building a analytic and development team.\n\n0 USA, FVEY) Development of a strategic vision for use of CNE\ndata in \n\n(UIIFOUO) TAO Data Flow Acquisition\n\nUSA, FVEY) The first step in processing CNE data is to identify and\nacquire CNE data flows in order to route this information into This work\npresents its own unique challenges,, as described in the next section.\n\n(U) Current State\n\nDerived From: 1?52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify 011: 20291123\nTOP TO USA,\n\n\nTOP 1 23\n\nUSA, FVEY) CT10 is ingesting a single flow of CNE data, specifically\nFOXACID log files. This was identified as a top priority by CT10 customers\ntherefore it was chosen to be the first CNE data flow to pursue.\nAfter mapping the flow of FOXACID data throughout NSA, CT10 established a\nflow of this data from Protocol Exploitation starting in the middle of February\n2008.\n\nUSA, FVEY) Because the CNE data model extension had not been\nimplemented at this time, the only way to process FOXACID logs was to fit the\ninformation into the current CT10 data model. This was possible primarily\nbecause of the natural flexibility in the current model. It was easy to define a new\n?event type? within the CT10 ingestion system, and populate events with all\nselectors pulled from the each FOXACID event. Another benefit of the current\nmodel design was that it became easy to define a new selector type for an\nimplant ID and easily integrate it into the system. This allows implant IDs to be\nadded to watch lists and as target selectors, so that CT10 users can track any\nevents that are associated with a defined set of implants. Therefore, if CT10\nacquired a data flow containing implant callback information, it would be easy to\nadd this into the current data model, giving additional capability to follow\nimplants deployed through FOXACID.\n\nUSA, FVEY) As a result of this work, the CT10 system is now alerting\non FOXACID exploitation activity through a suite of alerting technologies. This\nincludes gee-locational tipping in GeoT, and alerting through Agent Logic (IRC\nand e-mails) and the iSpace dashboard.\n\nUSA, FVEY) One conclusion reached from developing the FOXACID\ningestion code is that the current CT10 data model can support more CNE data\nthan previously believed. As new CNE flows are introduced into the system, it\nmay be possible to easily add them to the current data model if the extension is\nstill not implemented.\n\n(UIIFOUO) Near and Long Term Goals for TAO Data Flow\nAcquisition\n\nUSA, FVEY) The near term goal regarding CNE data flow into CT10 is\nto identify additional CNE data flows that build off of the FOXACID data. Based\non the requirements of the immediate next step would be to acquire\nimplant callback data flows. This would allow to track when their\nimplants are calling back to listening posts for tasking and exfiltration. The\nimplants in question are VALIDATOR, OLYUMPUS, UNITEDRAKE, and\nSTRAITBIZZAREUSA, FVEY) After establishing this data flow, the next step would be\nto ingest collected data from the implants. This includes any exfiltrated files, and\nimplant plug-in results. With each new data flow, CT10 will have a more\ncomplete picture of CNE activity related to their targets. However, these types of\ndata do not naturally fit into the current data model, which is why the proposed\nextension is so important.\n\nUSA, FVEY) Additionally, there are other CNE datasets not created\nby TAO that would be useful to CT GOLLUM, a partner implant, is one\nsuch data set that has indicated that would be useful to ingest into\nRADIUS logs (ISP dial up customer records) are also an excellent source\nof information, and create a natural link between DNR and DNI datasets.\n\n(U) Challenges I Way Ahead\n\nUSA, FVEY) There are a number of challenges for securing further\nCNE data from TAO. First, given the complexity of TAO data flow, locating the\nultimate data owner is challenging. Though everyone in TAO CT10 has interacted\nwith on data flow issues has been extremely helpful, no new CNE flows have\nbeen established. This is largely due to the fact that CT10 is not imbedded within\nthe requirements generation process in TAO. Additional transparency on TAO\ndata flow requirements will greatly ease this issue.\n\nUSA, FVEY) One other issue that would greatly help other systems in\nusing TAO data, is a universal marking and classification of CNE data. In the\ncase of FOXACID, there are no native classification markings on the files, and\ncompartmented targets as well as FISA data have to be stripped out by TAO\nbefore data is sent on to external customers such as As CT10 becomes PL3\naccredited, it becomes critical that CT10 ingests full FOXACID records.\nUnfortunately, the lack of a unique marking and classification for each file creates\nadditional challenges that complicate the oversight, classification and policy\nsurrounding CNE data. Furthermore, additional discussions with TAO have\nindicated that this may be an issue for other data flows as well. The addition of\nclassification markings to TAO data feeds would greatly assist all consumers of\nTAO data with maintaining the proper security procedures.\n\nTAO engineers have worked towards creating an RDF database\nsystem that would house all of their information, and make it available to external\ncustomers. As this capability is developed, CT10 could benefit greatly from\nbecoming a consumer of this data. This system would address a number of\nissues, including the marking and classification challenge addressed in the\nprevious paragraphUSA, FVEY) In summary, the way ahead is to address these existing\nchallenges in order to effectively push more TAO data flows out to in\nnear real time. should also remained with effort to develop\nand deploy the RDF database. Finally, needs to implement the data model\nextension and move any currently ingested TAO data into the new model.\n\nTOP 1 23\n\n"

(pictured), a counterterrorism subject-\nmatter expert in TAO's Requirements and Targeting organization,\nspoke with SIDtoday recently to explain how TAO carries out its work:\n\n \n\n \n\n1. What do TAO Requirements 6: Targeting like\nyou do? -- What's your role?\n\n(U) Our role in is to serve as a liaison with the TOPIs in 82. We work with the\nTOPIs to ?nd out what they really want in terms of CNE [computer-network\nexploitation] collection and then work within TAO to ?gure out how to get To\ngive you a quick overview, there are different elements in TAO:\n\n- First there are are the developers who create the software and\nthe hardware -- the tools that TAO uses to carry out our collection.\n\n- Next are the operators in the ROC [Remote Operations Center]\nwho actually use the tools. They do the actual collection of intelligence from\nthe targets' systems, while showing good OPSEC [operations security] and\nmaking sure our tools themselves are protected.\n\n0 And then there is my element, Requirements and Targeting. We are\nthe and planners for operations. We ?nd out what the TOPIs are\nlooking for, do the network analysis, and draw up a plan for getting that\ncollection.\n\n0 Supporting it all are the folks who provide the infrastructure. They\nprovide the computers, networks, etc. and keep everything running.\n\nEach group brings a different skill to the table. Regarding the tools we\nuse, the developers know the coding for them, the operators know how to use\nthem, and just knows that they exist. focus is on where we can\napply the tools to get the intelligence we want.\n\nIn TAO, we all have to work hand-in-glove. Often the are eager\nto grab whatever intelligence we can, while the operators are more conscious of\nthe risks involved, so we meet somewhere in between. Each side brings their own\nperspective and it creates checks and balances.\n\nThe ROC does after-action reviews of operations -- every action taken is\nautomatically recorded -- to make sure things were done appropriately. Operators\nhave to be certi?ed -- and they can have their certi?cations pulled -- so they have a\nstrong incentive to show good OPSEC.\n\n2. Do participate when operations are\ncarried out in the If so, how does it play out?\n\nYes, the actually sit side-by-side with the ROC operators\nwhen an operation takes place. We're there to provide knowledge of the\nnetworks, and the operators, as I mentioned, know how to use the tools to\nextract the data.\n\nNowadays there are dedicated and operators working on\n\n2of4\n\nSIDToday - Interview with a SID \"Hacker\" -- Part 1: How Does TAO Do Its Work?\n\nspeci?c targets. So, for example, I work the CT [counterterrorism] target, and we\nhave counterpart operators who focus on CT, too. (In the past, we would\nhave shown up for an operation and been assigned an operator randomly out of a\npool.) The bene?t of this new approach is that the and operators can\ndevelop working relationships and collaborate ahead of time on an upcoming\noperation.\n\nIn terms of how an operation is scheduled, our decide to work\na project and start to do research on targets to go after. Next we get approvals\nthrough the ROC mission directors to pursue operations against those targets. The\nmission directors are a small group of people with lots of experience. They assess\nthe risks involved in the operation and approve or deny it. Once we have the\napproval, the plan an operation in coordination with an operator and,\nwhen they are ready, arrange a speci?c time to carry it out. We have the ?exibility\nto conduct the operation at the optimal time.\n\nIn the early days TAO used to be just a bunch of hackers! We did things\nin a more ad hoc one guy did it all. Now we're more systematic in how we\ndo things.\n\nIn the CT world, we usually go after the infrastructure (like an ISP\n[internet service provider]) or after the speci?c target in end-point collection --\nextracting data from a speci?c \"box\" [computer or device]. Normally collection is\nautomated for end-point, but sometimes it's an interactive, real-time event when\nthe target is up on the net. The latter happens quite a bit in CT. The operations\nmight take place at 2AM or 6AM, since that is when the target is active. Some CT\ntargets use really slow dial-up connections from remote places in the Pakistani\ntribal areas, and we have to move quickly when the opportunity presents itself.\n\n \n\n(U) you need linguists to participate in your operations, to\ntranslate the names of the ?les, etc?\n\nNot as much as you might think. We don't evaluate the content of the\ndata, we just collect it. Usually we have an idea of what types of ?les and\ninformation the TOPIs are interested in -- like text ?les -- and we try to grab all of it\nfor analysis later. We don't take the time during the operation to sort out the good\nfrom the bad.\n\n(U) Stand by for the conclusion of this interview, appearing tomorrow.

The GENIE Project plans, equips, and\nconducts Endpoint operations that actively compromise otherwise intractable targets and complement Midpoint\nprograms that passively eavesdrop on communications links. GENIE Endpoint activities use surreptitious virtual\nor physical access to create and sustain a presence inside targeted systems or facilities. Targeted systems are\ncompromised electronically, typically providing access to system functions as well as data. System logs and\nprocesses are modi?ed to cloak the intrusion, facilitate future access, and accomplish other operational goals. Data\nof interest is harvested directly or pushed (shaped) to Midpoint collectors (a form of active?passive integration)\nand can also assist HUMINT, law enforcement, and DOD Information Operation activities as authorized.\n\nTO USA, FVEY) To maximize agility and minimize risk and cost, a targeted system is usually\nsubverted remotely, via existing tools/implants and infrastructure. When remote access is not possible, field\noperations are undertaken usually with the aid of other or DOD activities to physically place hardware\nimplants or software modifications into or near targeted systems, or, if absolutely necessary, to conduct short?\nrange collection. Hardware and software engineering is required to upgrade capabilities, through anticipatory\nefforts against leading commercial products as well as more directed work to fill key gaps against specific targets.\n\nTO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint activities support the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity\nInitiative (CNCI) and the IC's Next Generation Wireless (NGW) IC Wireless Implementation Plan (ICWIP)\naimed at preventing technological surprise by having the right NGW capabilities at the right time while achieving\ncost savings through cross?1C collaboration.\n\nTO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint capabilities are leveraged to support Title 10 CNO under\nUSCYBERCOM direction and legal authority. Similarly, TAO uses MIP Intelligence Support to Information\nOperations resources to posture the Endpoint infrastructure and tools with sufficient diversity to conduct Title 10\nCNO. Additionally, GENIE Endpoint operations are conducted to detect foreign cyber operations to support\ndynamic defense of networks.\n\nTO USA, FVEY) Exploitation of Endpoint devices personal computers, network servers\nand routers, computer?controlled cellular systems and infrastructures, mobile computing devices, etc.) contributes\nto hundreds of SIGINT reports each quarter, including CT?related and other SIGINT reports that address the\nhighest priorities of the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF). GENIE Endpoint methods also\nprovide law enforcement, the military, and other customers with geolocation, lead information, target access, and\nunique technical services. The broad range of GENIE activities requires continuous technical development to\nkeep pace with the rapid, market driven evolution of IT products and technology, which includes tools/implants\n\nTOP 105\n\nTOP \n\nremaining stealthy against ever vigilant personal security products anti?virus software and firewalls) that\ncould detect and thwart CNO.\n\nTO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint operations are performed over foundational infrastructure\ncapabilities, which must remain robust and defend against hostile intrusion.

According to the Germans, besides being\nresponsible for the death of several German soldiers, -IED attacks had led\nto the gradual erosion of popular support for the Afghan government in general,\nand speci?cally for the Afghan National Security Forces in the region (Badakhshan\nProvince in northern Afghanistan).\n\nOperation PITCH BLACK Gets the \"Green Light\"\n\nGerman forces, frustrated with IED attacks by this nemesis,\ncoordinated with Afghan Special Narcotics Forces (with British mentors) to action\nthe target, after receiving special permission from the German Minister of Defense.\n(German forces rarely deploy from their bases in Afghanistan.) NSAG provided\npre-operation target packages and linguistic and analytic operational support prior\nto and during the operation, working through the Interagency Operations\nCoordination Center (IOCC).\n\n(U) SIGINT Locates the Elusive Target\n\nAt day break on 7 May, approximately 50 German troops and 15\nAfghan soldiers arrived at -compound in the village of Bashun.

The casualties are detailed below:\n\n- Casualty 1 - FAM. Believed to be Obj DOODY. Assessed at Cat A. Injuries caused by 30mm AH strike, resulting intestine and head injuries. Drifting\ninlout of conscious. Radial pulse-present.\n\n- Casualty 2 FAM. Assessed at Cat B. Injuries from shrapnel. Wounds to right arm and face, he is conscious.\n\n- Subsequently the body of a LN Male Child with fragmentation wounds was discovered in compound CE10-32 (Gr 41R PO 17897 92491). The body was\nquickly claimed by a LN family member and removed for burial.\n\n- Casualty 1 (believed to be Obj DOODY) was subsequently transferred to KAF to receive treatment for his head wound on with an escort.\nAssessment\n\n- The CIVCAS are believed to be the result of the following chain of events. This is only a preliminary assessment and further investigations will bring more\ndetail. This assessment may contain errors due to the time constraints involved.\n\n- Initially correctly targeting Obj DOODY 1 INS the AH launched it attack run but could not engage.\n- The AH then circled around for a 2nd run on the 2 INS, possibly losing PID.\n\n- The AH then mistakenly targeted 2 civilians in the same engagement with a Hellfire miss, realising they were not the intended tgt, he continued on\nand engaged the INS PID as Obj DOODY with 30mm.\n\n3. Obj DOODY AH Strike 1 LN Child KIA 1 Cat \n\nWhat Have We Done About It?\n\n \n\n- At 1210hrs the DG was informed of the incident it was reported that ?he understands that we try to negate CIVCAS but accepted we needed to 'kill or wound\n\n\n- At 1325hrs the IAT was activated to investigate this incident. It will include a representative from the office.\n- A National Investigation (Shooting Incident Report) has been instigated into this incident.\n\n- Infl and media have been informed.\n\nWhat are we going to do about it?\n\n- CF will continue to investigate the incident on the ground speaking with LNs to gain a greater understanding of the incident and its likely effects. They\nwill also attempt to locate family members for future compensation payments.\n\n- Casualty 2 in BSN will be re-classified as an LN and interviewed by the BSN CIFT team to gain further information. His details will also be recorded for future\ncompensation payments.\n\n- Casualty 1 in KAF will be processed in the normal manner for a suspected high value target.\n\nTFH initial Assessment\n\n- The TFH initial assessment is that the 2 CIVCAS was caused by ISAF troops. The exact reasons why this occurred will be investigated in detail but initially\nappear to be a loss of PID, on repositioning of the Aircraft by the AH crew.\n\n"

To\nattack this narcotics - insurgency nexus, NSA Georgia's Southwest Asia Narcotics\nDivisioin (SWAN - FGS2F) has worked closely with a number of colleagues,*\nfocusing on narcotics traf?cking networks that provide funding, weapons, and\nlogistical support to Taleban elements in Afghanistan.\n\nThe resulting SIGINT reporting, along with reporting from\nother Intelligence Community elements, made clear to national and theater\nleadership that the insurgency could not be defeated without disrupting\nthe narcotics trade. Additionally, some narcotics traf?ckers have been identi?ed\nas active insurgent commanders, directing their own ?ghters in attacks against the\ncoalition, and procuring weapons and improvised explosive device (IED) materials.\n\n \n\nIn May 2008, FGS2F began providing\nreal-time support to counternarcotics operations\ntargeting processing laboratories, traf?ckers'\ncompounds, and the traf?ckers themselves as they were\non the move. Among the operations supported in\nwhole or in part by was the largest single\nseizure of drugs in history, according to DEA -- 237\nmetric tons of hashish. In all, FGS2F and its colleagues\nat NSAW, FSU, and GCHQ has provided real-time\nintelligence to over 20 counternarcotics operations, netting thousands of kilograms\nof drugs, several detainees, and weapons.\n\nPf Detainee\nsurrounded by opium\nseized by Coalition\nforces\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs 2009 approached, the narcotics traf?cking - insurgency nexus\ngained prominence in ISAF's (International Security Assistance Force, i.e. NATO\nforces in Afghanistan) plan to defeat the Taleban. Narcotics traf?ckers were added\nto the Joint Prioritized Effects List (I PE L) for the ?rst time, allowing them to be\ntargeted for strikes. In October 2008, NATO Defense Ministers agreed that\nnarcotics traf?cking networks were legitimate targets for ISAF forces, due to the\ntraf?ckers' ties to the insurgency.\n\n \n\n., in December 2008, the Deputy\n\nTaleban membf?rs Commander for Security in ISAF's Regional Command -\nbear weapons In South declared narcotics traf?cking as his #1 priority.\nSnowy 0f Concurrent with these events, SIGINT replaced\nAfghamStan (Reuters) HUMINT as the primary driver of counternarcotics\n\noperations, thanks in large part to the efforts of an\n\nFGS2F analyst embedded with the lnteragency\n\nOperations Coordination Center in Kabul . By\n\nthe end of 2008, Representative Afghanistan\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20f4\n\nSIDToday - SIGINT Helps Hobble the Taleban by Cutting Off Their Livelihood\n\nreported that 80% of all counternarcotics operations were now SIGINT-\ndriven. A year previously, HUMINT was the driver for almost every operation.\n\nDespite its relatively small size (18 personnel as of January 2009),\nFGS2F continues to be a prominent part of the ?ght against the narco-insurgency\nin Afghanistan, even as customer needs climb rapidly:\n\n0 As of late January 2009, FGS2F was supporting an average of one\ncounternarcotics operation per week. By comparison, the last seven months of\n2008 saw an average of just over one per month.\n\n0 Two counternarcotics operations supported by FGS2F in January 2009 netted\nover 6 metric tons (6,000 kilograms) of opium, worth millions of dollars --\ndescribed by one traf?cker as \"a big loss.\" In 2008, by contrast, total opium\nseizures measured only in the hundreds of kilograms.\n\n0 When one of FGS2F's primary targets, Mullah Multan, made a rare entry into\nAfghanistan from Pakistan, NSAW and NSAG combined to work with forward\nelements to have a strike conducted on Multan's convoy within hours of\nidentifying his presence. Though Multan survived the strike, he was driven\nback to Pakistan and suffered the loss of over 3 tons of opium along with six of\nhis cohorts -- a severe disruption to his narcotics network.\n\nL) SIGINT efforts to target the ?ow of narcotics trade funding to the\nTaleban are paying real dividends by disrupting ?nancing and logistical support\ncritical to the insurgency, saving lives and contributing to the Coalition's ability to\nestablish security throughout Afghanistan.\n\n \n\n(U) A British ISAF soldier\nphotographs the destruction of\nseized opium (lane's)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(U) Notes:\n\nThese colleagues were located at NSAW, GCHQ, Field Station Utah\n(FSU), the Joint Narcotics Analysis Centre - London, and the Interagency\nOperations Coordination Center (IOCC) in Kabul.\n\nEditor's note: This article is reprinted from NSA Georgia's \"Around\nnewsletter.

This differs from ESP integrity protection that does not include the IP header.\n\n(U) PPTP\n\n(U) The Point?to?Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) was developed in 1996 by the PPTP Forum, comprised of Ascend\nCommunications, US. Robotics, 3Com, Copper Mountain Networks, ECI Telematics, and lead by Microsoft.\n\n(U) The Microsoft implementation of PPTP (RFC 2637) permits the data link layer protocol, Point?to?Point Protocol (see\nto be tunneled through an IP network, encapsulated within an enhancedfmodi?ed Generic Routing Encapsulation\n(GRE) transport protocol (IP Next Protocol 47). The contents of the data is normally IP network protocol packets for a\nprivate network, but can also carry any other Local Area Network (LAN) protocol, like Microsoft or Novell IPXISPX.\n(U) Microsoft PPTP permits the encapsulated data to be authenticated using either version 1 (RFC 2433) or\nversion 2 (RFC 2759) of the Microsoft extensions to the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) (RFC 1994),\n\nand to be using RC4 with key of 40, 56, or 128 bits (RFC 3078, RFC 3079).

TURMOIL Stage 1 applications process the\npackets into sessions and when appropriate forwards the content to follow-on processing systems. The DNC\neventing (PPF) components in TURMOIL detect all IKEIISAKMP and ESP packets and queries KEYCARD for each unique\nIKE exchange session and each unique ESP session to determine if the link should be selected for processing.

In this spin, there were 2 major\nchanges.\nI (S) First, the analytic was converted to run in the Metrotube 2 framework, as aJSorcerer Service on the Metrotube\nService Bus.\nI (S) Second, the VIAS is now released by the ValiantSurf (DNC) team directly to Turbulence, where Spin 11 and earlier\nversions were packaged by the DNC team, delivered informally to Metrotube Services who performed the software\nrelease to Turbulence.\n\nI (S) Spin 11 and prior VPN Analytic runs as a Metrotube 1 service.\nI (S) An improvement to the IkeSessionizer algorithm correctly matched up the initiator and responder by waiting for the\nresponder to return a non-ZRC (Zero Responder Cookie).\n\n(U) CIET Tasking\n\nI (SHSIHREL) Tasking for \n\n(U) Test\n\n\n\nI (SHSIHREL) RFCs Required for TML 18.1 and earlier releases\nI (SHSIHREL) VALIANTSURF RFCs\n\nDNC Metadata\nI (SHSIHREL) Spin14 VPN IKE Metadata Test Document -\n\nI (SHSIHREL) Spin13 VPN IKE Metadata Test Document -\nI (SHSIHREL) Spin12 VPN IKE Metadata Test Document -\n\n90f13\n\nVALIANTSURF - Wikilnfo\n\nDNC \n\nI (TSHSIHREL) Spin12 VPN Test Document -\n\nLONGHAUL Test\n\nLONG Test Documentation Page\n\nOne CA Server Toggled among Multiple TURMOILs\n\n(UIIFOUO) This section describes a network design to have one CA server serve multiple TURMOILs.

Two sub-projecLs under CIET are\nVALIANTSURF and GALLANTWAVE.\n\n(TSHSIHREL) GALLANTWAVE (CW) is a CES Mission Application hosted on TURMOIL that enables exploitation of target communications that employ Data Network Session Cipher (DNSC) technologies. The GALLANTWAVE\nmission application integrates with solutions at the front end. After interacting with TS's LONGHAUL key recovery service via ISLANDTRANSPORT, it exploits the cipher at the front end, exposing the\nplain text to follow-on selection and collection.\n\n \n\nlerary an: 1kg \n\n \n\n(SHSIHREL) Information revealing any capability NSA has to exploit a speci?c target?s or company?s implementation of for GALLANTWAVE technologies is BULLRUN.\n\nContents\n\nI 1 (UHFOUO) VALLANTSURF: TURMOIL GALLANTWAVE\nI 1.1 GALLANTWAVE Detailed Description\nI 1.2 Data Flow Diagrams\nI 2 (U) Open GALLANTWAVE DRs\nI 2.1 (U) Old GALLANTWAVE DRs\nI 2.2 Spin 12.2\nI 2.3 Spin 12.1\nI 3 Spin 22\nI 3.1 Stories\nI 3.2 (U) RFCs\nI 4 Spin 21\nI 4.1 Stories\n\nGALLANTWAVE Detailed Description\n\n(TSHSIHREL) GALLANTWAVE (CW) implements TML Stage 1 PPF graphs (1 per host) with dedicated instances of the TechPromote and the CW PPF graphs identify and promote DNSC packets that\nmeet criteria speci?ed in a Rules.cfg file. graph subsequently sessionizes the selected traf?c, injecLs control-?ow metadata, and forwards targeted DNSC Sessi ns to a CW mission-application hosted on a\nCA Server. The GW?CAServer interacts with SCARLET FEVER (a CES LONGHAUL component) to transform those sessions for IP?addresses within a approved set of target IP?addresses. The GW?CAServer transformed sessions\nare sent to XKEYSCORE via a modified TURMOIL XKS-SESSIONS graph for session processing, strong-selection, and forwarding to follow-on processing systems and Corporate Repositories.\n\nData Flow Diagrams\n\nTUMULT \nStage 0\n\n \n\nDHSC\nPackers If Tu ww- \nTURMOIL Transb'mvd \n\\t snags.

The collection missions for this effort\nare targeted collection (HAMMERCHANT) and collection of \ntraf?c (HAMMERSTEIN). The desire to have the active?passive integration\ncapability is driven by three key motivations: scaling the exploitation of\nstreaming content, enhancing the likelihood of success for the VPN capability,\nand eventually creating new capabilities that can?t be achieved separately. In\nspeci?c:\n\n \n\nRouters ex?ltrate content in real?time as a packet stream rather than as a\n?le. Current TAO backend collectors for HAMMERMILL are expected to\nbe strained with a large number of streaming packet ex?l sessions. The\ncurrent backend capacity to receive HAMMERMILL streams is expected\nto limit the number of simultaneous or VPN streams that can be\nreceived.\n\n0 The capability to selected streams is built into\nTURMOIL, as is the capability to route back to CES the IPSEC key\nexchanges necessary to recover selected keys. Directing IPSEC VPN\ntraf?c to TURMOIL puts it where it can be most ef?ciently used.\n\n0 Integration with TURMOIL and TURBINE will enable HAMMERMILL\nmissions to leverage TURMOIL selection and targeting rather than\noperating stand?alone. This would make implants lighter, and less\ncomplex, at the expense of possibly more ex?lled traf?c.\n\nThe end?state goal of the APEX development is to\n\nAchieve the real?time ex?l of HAMMERMILL active collection and direct\nit to a TURMOIL passive collector that can recognize the traf?c, unwrap\nthe packets from the TAO protocol, and restore the packets to their\noriginal state.\n\n0 Perform appropriate processing/forwarding of the unwrapped content to\ncorporate repositories, and optionally perform further target\nidenti?cation and traf?c selection in TURMOIL\n\nEngage TURBULENCE storage and analytic processes for delivery of\ncontent to \n\n0 Enable TURBINE dynamic control of both HAMMERMILL and TURMOIL,\nallowing near?real?time implant tasking based on feedback from\nTURMOIL.\n\n[edit] (U) Background\n\n20f12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\n[edit] (U) IPSEC Protocols\n\ndescribes a suite of protocols for creation of VPN tunnels\nbetween devices. is the protocol used to exchange \nparameters and establish a secure tunnel. is the protocol that performs\nthe packet?by?packet A wide variety of algorithms of varying\nmay be used within IPSEC. CES generally requires the packets from\nboth sides of an IKE exchange and knowledge of the associated pre?shared key\n(PSK) in order to have a Chance of recovering a key for the corresponding\nCipher (ESP). A major goal of APEX is to access two sides of key exchanges for\ntraf?c of interest.\n\n[edit] (U) \n\nHAMMERMILL is the base capability for implants on a family of\nrouters. Built on HAMMERMILL are a suite of mission applications for\ncollection of various types of traf?c. HAMMERMILL uses FASHIONCLEFT to\nex?l a copy of targeted data as a packet stream.\n\nHAMMERMILL 2.0 is deployed and is commanded by a custom\ncommand interface. Targeting information must be delivered via these\nmanually initiated commands to the HAMMERMILL application.\nHAMMERMILL 2.5 is designed to accept command and control via\nCHIMNEYPOOL messages and is awaiting testing.\n\nHAMMERSTEIN is a HAMMERMILL application module that is\ntasked to collect all packets that match a 5?tuple ?lter of source and\ndestination IP address, source and destination port, and protocol.\nHAMMERSTEIN can collect IKE and ESP based on a 5?tuple ?lter.\nHAMMERCHANT is an application module that identi?es \nsignaling passing through the router, extracts the user identi?ers, and collects\nthe call if one of the users corresponds to an entry on its target list.\n\n[edit] (U) FASHIONCLEFT Protocol/CDR\n\nFASHIONCLEFT is the protocol used by HAMMERMILL and\nother TAO implants to deliver collected data back to the TAO Common Data\nReceptor (CDR). FASHIONCLEFT precedes an ex?l session with a strongly\nSession Announcement that describes the parameters of the ex?l\nsessmn.\n\n[edit] TURMOIL Existing Capability - VPN\nTURMOIL is a passive ?ltering and collection device targeting\nhigh?speed networks. Within TURMOIL are existing (passive) IPSEC\n\nprocessing capabilities, processing IKE and ESP packets identi?ed by the\nTURMOIL front?end ?ltering.\n\n30f12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\nThe passive VPN metadata generation capability receives IKE\npackets from front?end packet ?ltering and creates a metadata\nrecord for each key exchange seen, destined eventually for the TOYGRIPPE\ndatabase. This process can be deployed anywhere a TURMOIL is deployed.\n\nThe blade\" processes targeted IKE and ESP. This capability\ncannot be deployed to all TURMOIL sites, only to those that meet CES security\nconstraints.\n\nThe PIQ blade performs two main tasks. It checks the IKE source\nand destination addresses against a target list stored in KEYCARD. If one of\nthese is targeted, it sends the key exchange packets back in near?real?time to\nCES databases via a connection directly to the CES Attack Orchestrator (AO).\n\nThe PIQ blade also receives ESP traf?c. When a new targeted\ntunnel is observed, the PIQ blade asks the AO if a key is available and buffers\nthe ESP traf?c as long as it can while waiting for a key. If a key is returned,\nthe ESP is and the underlying IP packets are made available for\nother application processing in TURMOIL. Because ESP packet?\nby?packet, the PIQ blade can begin of a session when a key arrives,\neven if the earliest packets have fallen out of the buffer.\n\n[edit] TURMOIL Existing Capability - \n\nTURMOIL also contains existing capability for processing \ntraf?c, including and H.323. Capabilities for other protocols are in\ndevelopment. The passive capability relies on seeing the signaling setting up a\ncall, extracting identi?ers related to the calling and called parties, looking up\nthese identities for targeting information (via a KEYCARD lookup), and\ncollecting targeted traf?c. TURMOIL also has the capability to generate\nmetadata records for all calls, not just targeted ones, for the FASCIA database.\n\n(U) TURBINE\n\nTURBINE is focused on command and control of covert implants.\nIt can execute automated work?ows and is designed to communicate with\nTURMOIL as well as other devices, enabling integration of active and passive\ninformation in near?real?time. TURBINE communicates with covert implants\nvia CHIMNEYPOOL messages over a covert infrastructure, and with TURMOIL\nand other devices via ISLANDTRANSPORT.\n\n[edit] TOYGRIPPE and METROTUBE VPN Analytic\n\nThe TURMOIL component that creates metadata records from\nall IKE key exchanges forwards ?les of these metadata records to the\nPRESSUREWAVE database. METROTUBE is a framework for hosting analytic\nprocesses that operate on items in PRESSUREWAVE. The VPN Analytic is a\nprocess that is triggered when a new ?le of VPN\n\n4of12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\nmetadata arrives in PRESSUREWAVE. This process extracts the ?le, converts\nthe records into a format that TOYGRIPPE ingests, and forwards the result to\nTOYGRIPPE. To support APEX, all three of the components manipulating the\nmetadata the TURMOIL metadata extractor, the VPN analytic and the\nTOYGRIPPE database require modi?cation to support the additional\ninformation about the data source that APEX provides (see Analytic\nChallenges from APEX \n\n[edit] (U) APEX\n\nCurrently HAMMERMILL ex?ls its packets by sending both the\nFASHIONCLEFT session announcement and the ex?lled packet stream to one\nof the Common Data Receptor addresses. APEX changes the operation of\n\nHAMMERMILL ex?l.\n\n[edit] HAMMERMILL ex?l operation in APEX\n\n \n\nThe destination address for HAMMERMILL ex?l is set to direct the traf?c\nto a link that a TURMOIL can see.\n\n0 The TURMOIL APEX components are con?gured with the HAMMERMILL\ndestination address and any ports needed to identify potential\nHAMMERMILL traf?c with a 5?tuple ?lter. The APEX components are also\nprovided with parameters needed to the FASHIONCLEPT\nprotocol and reconstruct the ex?lled packets to their original form.\n\n0 The APEX code unwraps the FASHIONCLEFT protocol, reconstructs the\npackets and directs them to an application?speci?c process (currently\nor VPN). This process is responsible for properly handling the\napplication metadata delivered in the Session Announcement \nto/from phone numbers for the ex?lled packets, and the\ncon?guration information in the TURMOIL con?guration ?le to mark and\ndirect datato the appropriate path for further processing.\n\n[edit] Follow-on processing paths within TURMOIL\n\n \n\nAfter APEX unwraps FASHIONCLEFT, the reconstructed packets\ncan be directed to one of two follow?on processing paths within TURMOIL,\ndepending on the nature of the application: recirculation or forwarding.\n\nThe recirculation path presents the APEX?unwrapped packets\nand metadata to the TURMOIL ?ltering components as if they arrived on\npassive input. The recirculated packets can then engage\npassive processing and selection.\n\nThe forwarding path bundles the reconstructed packets together\nwith appropriate metadata and sends the bundle home through the normal\nTURMOIL forwarding path to PRESSUREWAVE, where further analytic\nprocesses may be run to prepare the data for corporate consumption.\n\n5of12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\n[edit] APEX mission applications\n\n \n\nInitial APEX missions are collection via TURMOIL of\nHAMMERSTEIN ex?l of VPN traf?c, and HAMMERCHANT ex?l of targeted\n\n\nHAMMERSTEIN IPSEC ex?l is an example of traf?c for which\nthere is an existing TURMOIL passive application. By recirculating the\npackets, the passive VPN applications will be engaged to perform their normal\nfunctions, though the packet stream will carry additional metadata related to\nthe APEX processing.\n\nHAMMERCHANT ex?l is an example of traf?c that is\npre?selected and needs no further selection processing. Furthermore, the \nsignaling is not ex?lled along with the collection; information such as calling\nparty and called party are carried as metadata in the FASHIONCLEFT Session\nAnnouncement. Recirculation cannot engage the passive components to\nperform formatting for the backend databases because these passive\nprocesses rely on seeing the SIP or H.323 signaling. The APEX process will\ntake the HAMMERCHANT sessions, extract needed metadata from the Session\nAnnouncements to attach to the session, and forward directly back to the\nPRESSUREWAVE repository for analytic processing.\n\nThe initial APEX proof?of?concept missions HAMMERSTEIN for\nVPN and HAMMERCHANT will develop and demonstrate both of these paths\n\n[edit] (U) APEX Command/ Control Development\n\nTo enable APEX, both TURMOIL and TURBINE must be supplied\nwith con?guration information and tasking. TURMOIL must have at minimum\nan implant ID, the address that this particular implant will put in the\ndestination address of all its packets (and possibly ports), a key to unwrap the\nFASHIONCLEFT protocol, a TAO case notation to assign to the ex?l, and\nappropriate TAO classi?cation markings for the ex?l. Other con?guration\nmetadata for the implant (PDDG, SIGAD, zip codes, etc.) may also be required.\n\nIn its end?state, command and control of both the\nHAMMERMILL implant and the TURMOIL APEX components will be\nperformed through TURBINE. TURBINE will be responsible for con?guring\nthe implant with an address to send its traf?c to and con?guring a receiving\nTURMOIL with the parameters it needs to identify and process that mission?s\ntraf?c. TURBINE will be able to receive information from TURMOIL\nprocessing of ex?lled traf?c, evaluate using a work?ow, and deliver updated\ntasking to HAMMERMILL. Development to this end?state will occur in three\nphases:\n\n0 phase 1: manual con?guration: HAMMERMILL is con?gured via its\nexisting command interface. Simultaneously TURMOIL APEX is provided\na con?guration ?le for this HAMMERMILL mission. A human is\n\n60f12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\nresponsible for keeping the two in sync.\n\nphase 2: semi?automatic con?guration for an already established\npresence: TURBINE receives the parameters for a mission and in an\nautomated fashion con?gures both the HAMMERMILL implant and the\ncorresponding TURMOIL APEX components. The \nHAMMERMILL interface will use CHIMNEYPOOL RPC commands, and\nthe interface will use ISLANDTRANSPORT.\nHAMMERMILL 2.5 is the HAMMERMILL version that can receive\nCHIMNEYPOOL commands and is required for phase 2. HAMMERMILL\n2.5 will be available only for low?end MIPS platforms.\n\n0 phase 3: dynamic targeting for an already established presence:\nTURBINE sets initial con?guration parameters as in Phase 2. Ex?lled\ntraf?c is evaluated by TURMOIL components for potential additional\ntargeting information. TURMOIL messages to TURBINE to dynamically\ntarget a particular ?ow through the router. An example is receiving an\nIKE key exchange (and possibly a few initial packets), evaluating the IP\naddresses to decide if the VPN being set up corresponds to a target, and\nmessaging back to HAMMERMILL to capture and ex?l the corresponding\nESP.\n\nPhase 3 of control must be managed so that router ex?l does not\nexceed the tolerable bandwidth limits set by OPSEC and operational concerns.\nTURBINE may need to implement additional work?ows in support of Phase 3\nto monitor and control ex?l volume. These work?ows will have to be designed\nto ?t the metrics and monitoring information that HAMMERMILL and APEX\nare capable of providing.\n\n[edit] APEX Application development\nVPN phases\n\nThe development of the VPN process via APEX will proceed in a\nphased fashion.\n\n0 VPN phase 1: IKE metadata only: IKE packets are ex?led to TURMOIL\nand unwrapped by APEX, recirculated and presented to the VPN\nprocessing components. Metadata is extracted from each key exchange\nfor the CES TOYGRIPPE metadata database. This database is used by\nSIGDEV to identify potential targets for further exploitation.\n\nVPN phase 2: Targeted IKE forwarding: In addition to the metadata\ngeneration, the IKE addresses are looked up in KEYCARD. If either IP\naddress is targeted, the key exchange packets are forwarded to the CES\nAttack Orchestrator.\n\nVPN phase 3: Static (manual) tasking of ESP: HAMMERSTEIN may be\nstatically (manually) tasked to forward targeted ESP. The ex?ltrated ESP\n\n7of12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\npackets are unwrapped by APEX, recirculated and presented to the VPN\nprocessing components for potential \n\nVPN phase 4: ESP dynamic targeting: Based on the value returned by\nKEYCARD, the ESP for a particular VPN may be targeted as well.\nTURMOIL will send HAMMERSTEIN (via TURBINE) the parameters for\ncapturing the ESP for the targeted VPN.\n\n[edit] phases\n\nHAMMERCHANT currently maintains its own list of targeted\nentities. It extracts identities from SIP or H.323 signaling, checks against\nits target list, and ex?ls only the voice content for targeted calls. This model\ncould be expanded in the future using HAMMERSTEIN.\n\n0 phase 1: HAMMERCHANT Collect: HAMMERCHANT targeted \nRTP ex?l is captured by TURMOIL. An APEX forwarding component\nbundles the voice packets into a ?le, attaches appropriate metadata, and\ndelivers to PRESSUREWAVE. A variant of the passive analytic will\nbe triggered to prepare the ex?l for corporate delivery.\n\n0 phase 2: HAMMERCHANT Survey: HAMMERCHANT monitors all\nSIP and H.323 signaling and ex?ltrates all call signaling metadata to\nTURMOIL. An APEX component puts the call signaling metadata into an\nASDF record and publishes it to the TURMOIL Asdeeporter component.\n\n0 phase 3: HAMMERSTEIN: signaling is captured by\nHAMMERSTEIN using port information. The signaling is ex?led to\nTURMOIL and unwrapped. This signaling is then presented to the normal\nTURMOIL processes. The metadata process will create metadata\nrecords for FASCIA. The collection process will extract identi?ers from\nthe signaling and check against KEYCARD to decide if the identi?ers are\ntargeted. If either calling party identi?er or called party identi?er is\ntargeted for active ex?l, then an extended TURMOIL component will\nextract the ports for the voice conversations and will send this\ninformation as a 5?tuple ?lter to HAMMERSTEIN, via TURBINE.\n\nImplementation of the Phase 2 and 3 processes will be\ndriven by mission need. The Phase 3 process should be advantageous in\nallowing HAMMERMILL to potentially expand beyond SIP and H.323 \ncollection without additional code development in the implant, leveraging\npassive processing code.\n\n[edit] Data?ow phases\n0 Data?ow Phase 1: Data?ow tested: Collected IKE is sent to CES\n\ndatabase. Collected targeted data is deposited into PRESSUREWAVE and\ncan query and view the data.\n\n80f12\n\nHigh Level Description Document - WikiInfo\n\nData?ow Phase 2: Migrate additional HAMMERSTEIN voice ?ows to\nPRESSUREWAVE. Ex?l all signaling via port selection and let the normal\nTURMOIL selection process select it.\n\nData?ow Phase 3: Institutionalize APEX capability and continue to\nmigrate other voice ?ows to PRESSUREWAVE.\n\n[edit] Goals by Spin\n\n[edit] (U) Spin 15 goals\n\nThe minimal goal for Spin 15 is to achieve VPN phase 1 IKE\nmetadata extraction using phase 1 manual con?guration. The APEX\nVPN goal is complete when a CES TAO VPN analyst validates the SRI and the\nIKE metadata content in TOYGRIPPE.

The ?rst hop after the client is to the subset of\nthe routers designated as ?guard? nodes. The ?nal hop in the TOR network is from a\nsubset of routers which choose to be an ?exit? node. There can be any number of TOR\nrouters between the guard and exit nodes but typical clients choose to have one router.\n\nThere are many features that mean it is hard to track traf?c through the TOR\nnetwork:\n\n0 Traf?c is in multiple layers between the client node and each TOR\nrouter (leading to the ?Onion? analogy). Hence data between each TOR router\nhas different ciphertexts. traf?c is only seen between the exit node\nand destination server.\n\n0 TOR splits all traf?c up into standard size ?cells?. Therefore packet sizes can not\nbe used to follow traf?c.\n\n0 Each connection between TOR routers will typically multiplex many circuits\" traf?c\neffectively masking any particular user?s traf?c.\n\n0 To ensure fairness of service TOR has a per?circuit rate?limiting store?and?forward\nbuffer in each router. This buffer tends to flatten timing features in traf?c. \n\nThe aim of this work is to ?nd the client IP address associated with \ntraf?c between an exit node and a destination server. This paper achieves this aim given\nthe following constraints:\n\n0 We must own the exit node. This constraint means that we can demultiplex traf?c\nby TOR circuit and thus get a cleaner signal. See section 5 for more detail.\n\n3\nThis information is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and may be exem )1 under other UK\ninformation legislation. Refer any FOIA queries to GCI K.) on\n\nUK TOP SECRET COMINT\n\n/61\n\n0 we must be able to log the packet times of the traf?c from the guard node to the\nclient.\n\n0 The TOR communication must be long and structured. we will demonstrate the\ntechnique against a single user browsing the web via TOR.\n\nThe client must not be running a TOR router of their own otherwise we can not\nseparate the client?s own traf?c from other TOR traf?c.\n\nThe attack we will present is based on correlating exit node and guard node traf?c and\ndoes not require tracking communications through any intermediate link in the TOR\nnetwork. This approach should help maximise the chance of a successful attack despite\nincomplete SIGINT coverage.\n\n2 Test data\n\nwe are going to work with two sets of data:\n\n1. Truthed data where we have matched guard node and exit node traf?c for a single\nuser web browsing.\n\n2. Bulk traf?c logs for guard nodes from four SIGIN bearers.\n\nwe will try to develop techniques that can correctly match up the truth data but not\nfalse alarm anywhere in the bulk SIGIN logs.\n\n2.1 Truthed data\n\nTOR is designed to make it hard to link client and exit node traf?c together. In conjunc?\ntion with and JTRIG we came up with a way to collect the exit node traf?c\nfrom our own web browsing. As illustrated in ?gure 1 we used a virtual private server\n(VPS) as an intermediate destination for our traf?c. We then run packet loggers on our\nclient machine and the VPS.\n\nwe run an open HTTP proxy server on the VPS. we want to run an open proxy server\nto ensure that there is minimal impact on the data flows (which, for example, authenti?\ncation may introduce) whilst still being able to conduct representative web browsing. A\nrisk of an open proxy server is that other internet users may use it thus potentially lead?\ning to unL wful traf?c interception. To avoid this danger we changed our ?User?Agent?\nstring to a non?standard value and the proxy server was con?gured to only respond to\nthis user agent. Furthermore the proxy server was only active for the brief duration of\nthe experiment. This setup was approved by JTRIG. No traf?c due to other users was\ndetected in the packet logs.\n\n4\nThis information is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 FOIA and mav be exem 3t under other UK\ninformation legislation.

Secondly= we changed the\nweb?browser User?Agent to match that accepted by our open HTTP proxy.\n\nFour experiments of about ten minutes each were conducted:\n\n1. ?News?: Search on Bing for news= followed by browsing BBC News and then the\nW?ashington Post.\n\n2. browsing the TOR website and then using a privacy checking website.\n3. ?Download?: visit to SlashDot followed by downloading a large PDF ?le.\n4. ?Forum?: Search on Google followed by browsing a PC technical help forum.\n\nPacket logs were collected for each of these. In each experiment one guard node and one\nexit node was used apart from in experiment 2 where TOR set up a new path during the\nexperiment with a change in both guard node and exit node. Therefore we will generally\nsplit experiment 2 into the two circuits ?2a? and \n\n2.2 Bulk data\n\nTo prove a low false alarm rate of any algorithm we need bulk data. we used IP\naddress dumps from four internet bearers (two were ?client?server? bearers and two were\n?server?client? bearers).

W'e therefore believe that we will approximately ?lter down to a superset\nof the wanted traf?c.\n\nW'e note that these ?ltering rules mean that we will ignore any clients that also run a\nTOR node. However this constraint will still apply for a potential operational scenario\nwhere we also run guard nodes; without full knowledge of the client one can not tell\nwhether a circuit is terminating in the client or being relayed through its TOR node.\n\n3 Why we are not tracking a circuit through the\nTOR network\n\nWhen we started this work= we considered attacks that tried to follow data through the\nTOR network. However an initial experiment based on JTRIG browsing logs showed\nthat SIGINT visibility was too low for a signi?cant chance of success.\n\nW'e will now describe the experiment conducted but the rest of the section is not\nrequired reading.\n\nW'e compare two sources of data:\n\n0 Communication between TOR servers seen in SIGIN T. TDSD deployed an ICTR\nsignature (in Squeal) to detect communication between TOR nodes across the\nSIGIN fleet for two days in December 2010. To remove signature false hits we\n?lter down to hits where both IP addresses are known to be TOR routers (by\nconsensus logs from the same period).\n\n0 TOR links used by JTRIG for a similar period. JTRIG log the usage of TOR\nconnections. Each of their circuits typically have two links between TOR routers.\n\n6\nThis information is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 FOIA and may be exem 3t under other UK\ninformation legislation. Refer any FOIA queries to GCI IQ on\n\nUK TOP SECRET COMINT\n\n/61\n\nThere were 1958 TOR routers in the relevant consensus ?les of which 1893 had\nsignature hits. We consider links between TOR routers as undirected and an all pairs\ncalculations allows us to estimate that there are 1.79 to 1.92 million possible links in the\nTOR network (we do not know whether we do not see a router due to it being off or\ninvisible to us).\n\nHowever we only see 6185 links between TOR routers in the SIGIN logs. Therefore\nwe are seeing about 0.3% of possible TOR links in SIGIN T. Note this percentage is likely\nto be an small underestimate of the visibility of TOR links as most TOR circuits will\nconsist of two links within the TOR network: one link involving a guard node and one\nlink involving an exit node. Based on the consensus logs there are 1.65 million links that\nsatisfy this constraint: this link count raises visibility to \n\nThe JTRIG logs use 8294 links between TOR nodes of which we see 13. Therefore\nwe could only sec 0.16% of JTRIG used TOR links in SIGIN T.\n\nThe JTRIG link visibility percentage and the population link visibility percentage\nsuggest a signi?cantly different underlying distribution (p?value between 0.005 and 0.01).\nTOR is claimed to use a server?s geolocation to choose circuits, perhaps this circuit\nchoosing algorithm hinders our visibility.\n\nIf we assume the visibility of each link in a 2?path within the TOR network is inde?\npendent then the chance of seeing any particular 2?path is between 1 in 100,000 and 1\nin 400,000. In the JTRIG logs of 2935 paths we would expect to observe both links of\none or more paths with probability 0.7% to We saw one so either we were lucky or\nlink visibility is correlated in a path.\n\nTo complete a circuit trace you would also need to see the client?to?guard?node traf?c\nand the exit?node?to?server traf?c which would lower the probability of visibility yet\nfurther. We believe such probabilities are too low for a useful attack and thus we do not\nconsider circuit tracing attacks further.\n\n4 Correlating guard and exit node traf?c\n\nWe will use the correlation in the timing of data packets between guard and exit nodes\nto deanonymise TOR. There are two features that we need to remember about TOR:\n\nTOR repacketises the data which means that packets and packet sizes can not be\nexactly followed through the network\n\n0 Each TOR node has a rate?limiting store?and?forward methodology which will af?\nfect packet timings\n\nThese two factors means that a burst of packets entering the TOR network will be\nsmeared out over time into cells that do not directly map to the input packets and\ncomparing histograms of guard and exit traf?c is hard \n\n7\nThis information is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 FOIA and may he exem 3t under other UK\ninformation legislation. Refer any FOIA queries to GCIIQ on\n\nUK TOP SECRET COMINT\n\n\n\nOur main insight is to consider cumulative distributions rather than histograms. In\nparticular we will consider cumulative packet count and cumulative TCP payload bytes.\nWe hope that over a long time window that there will be approximate conservation of\nthese quantities and the impact of rate limiting will be less signi?cant (rate limiting will\njust impose a maximum gradient).\n\nIn ?gure 2 and ?gure 3 we show cumulative packet counts and cumulative TCP\npayload sizes for our truth data. It can be seen that a lot of features are preserved it\nseems sensible to consider that comparison of these cumulative plots between guard and\nexit node traf?c could lead to a deanonymisation technique.\n\nConsidering ?gure 2 in more detail one can see steps in these plots replicated between\nguard node and exit node traf?c for all the plots apart from perhaps ?CtoS 4? perhaps\nclient?to?server traf?c is harder to deanonymise. You can also see that there are changes\nin scale (for example in experiment 3 there are more guard node packets than exit node\npackets).\n\nFigure 3 of cumulative TCP payloads shows some similar features. All the server?\nto?client graphs show preserved steps. However the client?to?server graphs do not show\nvery clear relationships. In particular looking at ?CtoS you can see a big difference\nduring the download of the large PDF ?le. The exit node is sending TCP ACKs with no\npayload back to the server but the client is sending larger TOR acknowledgement cells\nback which leads to a large difference in graph shape.\n\nTherefore we will consider deanonymisation based on cumulative packet counts. As\nwell as looking like a generally cleaner picture than using TCP payload, such an approach\nrequires less data to be collected by the SIGINT system. This easier data collection is\nexempli?ed by our bulk data logs these logs do not contain packet sizes, let alone TCP\npayload sizes.\n\n5 Why we want to own the exit node\n\nSIGIN gives us two added complications that the above truth data analysis above has\nignored:\n\n1. Each exit node is serving many clients which will add unwanted data into the traf?\n?c for a single user. TOR users are encouraged to run privacy?preserving proxies\ng. privoxy or polipo) and these proxies try to normalise the traf?c so that ev?\neryone shares the same HTTP header format. The impact of this is that SIGINT\nproxy demultiplexing techniques can not reliably be used. It is potentially possible\nto try and demultiplex traf?c via content analysis looking at what links are\nincluded in webpages) but such a technique would be complex and fragile to HTML\nformatting errors and require all web browsing to be \n\n8\nThis information is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 FOIA and may be exemJt under other UK\ninformation legislation.

The exit node could be contacting servers anywhere on the internet and\nunless we have collection very close to the exit node we are likely to only see a\nsubset of these connections.\n\nA potential approach around these problems is to demultiplex by HTTP server. We\nhope that (in a time window) there might only be one user browsing a particular website\nso demultiplexing by server will therefore demultiplex by user too. We also hope for\ncomplete collection of some of these streams as packets will hopefully follow a small\nnumber of routes between the exit node and the HTTP server.\n\nWe show the influence of demultiplexing by HTTP server in ?gure 4. It can be seen\nthat the clear picture in the previous section is no longer present; a modern webpage is\ntypically made up of content from many different HTTP servers. By it can be seen\nthat it is hard to link many of these fragments of traf?c per HTTP server to the guard\nnode traf?c. Indeed using the mathematical technique we will describe in the following\nsection only four of the server?to?client HTTP traces could be successfully linked to guard\nnode traf?c.\n\nWe therefore recommend that we analyse traf?c from exit nodes that we control.\nSuch an approach has several desirable features:\n\n0 We can demultiplex exit node traf?c by client as the TOR exit node can associate\nall traf?c with a circuit. Complex (and potentially inaccurate) demultiplexing\nalgorithms are not required.\n\n0 We collect all exit node traf?c for each client circuit  opposed to SIGIN which\nmay only give fragments of the traf?c). We therefore have the cleanest possible\ndata.\n\n0 We hope to deanonymise all traf?c for a circuit rather than just fragments of the\ntraf?c which may not contain the data of interest to an analyst.\n\nA resultant database of TOR traf?c would give a simple place to experiment and\ndeploy TOR deanonymisation analytics.\n\nThe NSA have already demonstrated the demultiplexing of traf?c in a TOR exit\nnode \n\n6 Score\n\nWe compare an exit trace and a guard node trace using basic linear regression (building\n\non a suggestion of  We bin time up into 1 second bins  1. . \n\n11\n\nThis information is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and may be exempt under other UK\ninformation legislation.

In each bin we then have a pair (Eh where E2: is the cumulative\nexit node packet count at time 7i and GE: is the cumulative guard node packet count at\ntime \n\nOur primary measure of association is the correlation between E2: and GE: as measured\nby the Pearson product?moment correlation coef?cient r. We expect that when the two\ntraf?c streams are associated that a very high correlation coef?cient will result. we\nnote that high correlation coef?cients are generally expected as we?re comparing two\nincreasing sequences.\n\nTo remove false positives we also ?t the following basic linear model:\n\n2  \n\nwe then use {3 to discard bad matches. We expect that a similar number of packets are\nexpected in both traces we only consider traces where 1/2 {3 2.\n\nA key consideration is how to handle guard node and exit node traces that do not\nprecisely overlap. We are assuming that our exit node trace is the complete log of a\nTOR circuit. On the other hand, the guard node trace may contain traf?c for other\nTOR circuits. We therefore truncate the guard node trace to the period of the exit node\ntrace. we also pad the guard node packet counts with zero if required to span the exit\nnode trace.\n\nIn addition we consider score all possible time shifts of the guard node trace against\nthe exit node trace i.e. trying out different timing offsets. we do this as we do not\nknow the clock offset in our truth data set and to be as generous as possible in ?nding\nfalse positives in the bulk logs. It is not known whether such a sliding approach may\nprove useful in practice with known clock offsets; it is possible that such an approach\nmay also combat unknown delays in the TOR network.\n\n7 Results\n\nwe ?rst show results of the proposed technique on our truth data set and then consider\nfalse positive rates.\n\nAs mentioned above we will slide the putative guard node and exit nodes traces\nagainst each other to allow for an unknown clock offset between the client and HTTP\nproxy in the truth data set and to give us the maximum number of comparisons when\ntrying to  the false positive rate.\n\n7.1 True positives in the truth data\n\nThe ?rst experiments are to understand the behaviour of the algorithm on the truth\ndata.

The false positive rate looks low enough to suggest this technique should\nbe carried forward.\n\nThe required data is not collected at present.

This data could be obtained by SIGIN or by running guard nodes. The\nSIGIN solution would require an up?to?date feed of TOR ?consensus? documents;\nTOR IP addresses could then be extracted from the ?consensus? documents for\n?ltering by the SIGINT system.\n\nAt the time of writing TRIG are investigating the collection of the exit node data and\nare trialling a feed of guard node data from research bearers.\nWider testing is recommended to better characterise the false positive rate.

The\nNIARL is designated as the R2 organization within the NSA Research\nDirectorate. is responsible for conducting and sponsoring\nresearch in technologies and techniques needed to secure America's\nfuture information systems. While breaking new ground is certainly\nrewarding, the overall goal for this research and exploration is to\nidentify concepts and solutions to reduce the Information Assurance\n(IA) risks facing our nation?s critical information systems.\n\n \n\nWithin R2?s general IA research thrusts of IA Engineering, and\nDefensive Computing, there are specific ?Focus Areas? dedicated to existing and/or\nanticipated critical challenges and technical IA risks. Focus Areas encompass topics such as\nResearch Integration, High Confidence Software and Systems, Secure Wireless Multimedia,\nand Security Enhanced Operating Environments. For a complete listing of R2 Focus Areas\nplease refer to the R2 website at\n\nIn this issue of The EDGE we examine the Research Integration Focus Area and\nthe associated IA research challenges of bringing research concepts together, providing\nrelevant mission context, and presenting IA approaches to customers and stakeholders. R223\nleads the Research Integration Focus Area and is charged with shepherding IA concepts and\ninnovations into the research prototype and demonstration stage. Please see the article \n\nfor a detailed discussion of this topic.\n\nI am sincereli interested in your feedback and suggestions, and I ask that you\n\nemail your comments to R2 Office Manager, a_ We look\nforward to hearing from you!\n\n  \n\nDerived From: 1?52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20320108\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\n\n(U) Contents\n(UIIFOUO) Information Sharinq Roadmap Initiative\n(U) Summer Mathematics, R21, and the Director?s Summer Proqram\n(UIIFOUO) Support for I54 Code Review\n(UIIFOUO) Key Manaqement Modelinq Research\n(U) The Research Journey from Passion to Prototype\n\n(U) R222 Photonic Loqic Proqram Review at Sandia National\nLaboratories\n\n(UIIFOUO) Sandia Trip Hithiqhts R225?s Anti-Tamper Research Proqress\n\n(UIIFOUO) R225IDepartment of Enerqy Enqaqement Yields Idaho\nNational Labs Research\n\n(UIIFOUO) CLARIFYMIND Wireless Pilot Technical Exchanqe with\nCanadian Representative\n\n(UIIFOUO) R22 Continues Collaboration with NSA CTOITS via Secure\nTokens Talk\n\n(U) R23 Supports Graduate Math Proqram Larqe Graph Research\n\n(U) OpenSolarislTM) FMAC: Brinqinq the Flask Mandatory Access Control\nArchitecture to OpenSolaris\n\n(UIIFOUO) R23 Contributes Behavioral Anomaly Detection to IDAICCS\nDISTILLERY SCAMP\n\n \n\n(UIIFOUO) HAIRBALL Deploys GraphViz for POPEYESEAR: Visualization\nTechniques for Computer Network Defense\n\n(UIIFOUO) Personnel News\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\n\n\n(U) From the NIARL Technical Director?s Desk:\n\n(UIIFOUO) Information Sharing Roadmap Initiative\n\nI Recently, I was asked to lead a small team, with\nrepresentation from across the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD),\nthe Commercial Solutions Center (NCSC), and the Research\nDirectorate, to develop an IAD roadmap for information sharing.\nObviously, this is not the first time an Agency or organization has\ndeveloped a roadmap on this topic. For example, community roadmaps\nwere developed by the Program Manager for Information Sharing\nEnvironment at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (Information\nSharing Environment Implementation Plan) and the Global Information Grid (GIG)\nInformation Assurance Portfolio (GIAP) management office (System Technology Evolution\nPlan (STEP) for the Secure Information Exchange (SIE) thread of the GIG Information\nAssurance Architecture). Unlike previous community efforts, this activity is focused on\ndeveloping an internal IAD information sharing roadmap.\n\n   \n\nI.\n\nSo why is an internal IAD information sharing roadmap needed? While there are\nmany reasons, the primary reasons are to provide a long term IAD vision for information\nsharing that is common across the corporation, to provide a shared context a corporate\ndescription of information sharing and the necessary activities to achieve information\nsharing), and to provide a tool to and anticipate individual IAD, NCSC and\nResearch activities related to information sharing. In a nutshell, this roadmap is intended to be\na starting point for harmonizing all IAD activities related to information sharing over an\nextended timeframe 5?7 years). Our goal is not to create a roadmap that competes with\nexisting community roadmaps. Our approach will be to existing community\nroadmaps into an internal roadmap that drives IAD investments in information sharing.\nLastly, our roadmap will be a living document and will be revised as the timeline moves to\nthe right, or as IAD learns more about information sharing requirements.\n\n\n\n(U) Corner:\n\nFor general information Research?s capabilities and\ncurrent efforts, please visit the R2 web site or the R21\nhomepage at link:\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\n  \n \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\n(U) Summer Mathematics, R21, and the Director?s Summer Program\n\n(U) The Director's Summer Program (DSP) is the agency's premier summer program for\nmathematics undergraduates. Since its inception in 1990, the mission of the DSP has not been\nsimply recruitment, (though a small but steady percentage of DSP participants do come back\nto work at NSA, often after obtaining an advanced degree), but rather an outreach effort\naimed at attracting the best mathematics students from around the country, educating them\nabout mathematics at NSA, and thus establishing ties with the future leaders of the outside\nmathematics community.\n\nWhile the DSP is hosted by the Mathematics Research Group, the technical\ndirectors come from across the Agency. In 2008 the technical directors were \nand This year?s 22 participants were\nculled from 260 applicants. Over 12 weeks, students worked in small teams with NSA\nmathematicians to develop real-world solutions to classified, operational problems.\n\nOver the years, R21 personnel have supported the DSP both as project mentors,\nwho propose a project and guide a small group of students (usually a 12-week, half-time\ncommitment), and as technical directors of the program, who select and interview the\nstudents, find projects and mentors, and serve as general technical and administrative support\nfull-time during the summer (usually a 2-year, half-time commitment).\n\nThis year, in addition to presenting their results to both the Director and De ut\nDirector of NSA, the DSP was invited to give classified presentations to \n\na professional staffer on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) as well as two\nmembers of the SSCI Technical Advisory Group.\n\nProjects from DSP 2008 of possible interest to R2 include: RANDOMIZERS, a\nstudy of open source randomizers, TUNDRA, research of a new statistic for codebook\nanalysis, and CLOUD, implementing graph algorithms in a cloud computing environment.\nShort summaries follow.\n\nRANDOMIZERS -- Because of their use in the generation of keying material,\nrandomizers play a critical role in modern systems. The RANDOMIZERS\nproject focused on two popular commercial software randomizers: Open SSL's randomizer\nand /dev/random. The DSP students researched the quality of these randomizers by\nmeasuring entropy and by considering attacks Forward Security). The\nstudents confirmed an outside attack on /dev/random, but they also showed that this attack is\nnot as strong as the outside paper claimed. They found no obvious weaknesses in Open SSL's\nrandomizer. Finally, the students examined a mixing component consisting of a shift register\nwith a contribution from an entropy source (modeled as Bernoulli--p bits). They determined a\ntheoretical bound on the number of register steps needed to reach full entropy given and the\n\nol nomial driving the shift register. This project was supported by?and\nof I73 5.\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\nTUNDRA Electronic codebooks, such as the Advanced \nStandard, are both widely used and difficult to attack NSA has only a\nhandful of in?house techniques. The TUNDRA project investigated a potentially new\ntechnique the Tau statistic to determine its usefulness in codebook analysis. This project\nwas supported by?of R21.\n\nCLOUD Cloud computing is a paradigm to perform massive computations in\nparallel on a cluster of computers via a ?map?reduce? model. The DSP students researched\nhow amenable cloud computing is to various graph algorithms. The team successfully\nimplemented the graph algorithms k?cores and k?trusses as well as two Agency contact\nchaining algorithms, STARFIRE (developed by DSP 1999) and CARPAT, in the map??reduce\nframework. Their research suggests most graph algorithms fit naturally in the framework.\n\nFurther, this framework su orts the ability to process larger data sets. This project was\nsupported bydof R1.\n\nThis summer the students made good progress on these and five other projects. A\nreport detailing all of the work done will be published by R1 in the fall of 2008.\n\nPOC: Dr. R211, \n\n(UIIFOUO) Support for I54 Code Review\n\nEarlier this yea_ Chief of 154, solicited volunteers to support a\nDIRNSA and Director of IAD chartered review of approximately 100,000 lines of Ada 83\ncode. _forward deployed from R21 and serving as 1542 Technical Director,\nenlisted R213 to provide support with automated software analysis tools.\n\nR213, led the automated analysis effort using the tool PolySpace\nfor Ada to analyze the code. PolySpace for Ada employs ?abstract interpretation? to analyze\ncode for a variety of errors such as uninitialized variables, integer overflow, et cetera. The\ninitial automated analysis identified some non?standard software features requiring more\nextensive examination. then teamed with? R213, to assist\nwith the analysis and provide results to 1543. As noted by Mr. - the\nautomated code analysis discoveries provided ?valuable? results, and complemented a parallel\n154 manual code analysis effort by highlighting several items undiscovered by the manual\nanalysis team.\n\nAnalyzing and debugging software code on fielded systems is a time?consuming,\nexpensive operation. Using automated techniques to identify coding abnormalities and bugs\nin system software prior to fielding reduces the overall cost of fixing software errors by an\norder of magnitude and significantly increased the quality of the deployed software. To this\nend, R213 continues to research the development of software environments and software\nlanguages focused on integrating automated analysis within the design and development\nstages of the software development lifecycle.\n\nPOCs: R213, (301?\nR213,\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\n(UIIFOUO) Key Management Modeling Research\n\nR21 is approaching two significant milestones in Key Management Modeling\n(KMM) research. First, the researchers appear to have found a proof and analysis technology\nthat is robust enough to do meaningful formal analysis of real key management systems.\nKMM is now making use of the Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA) developed\nunder contract to R213. CPSA was designed to analyze protocols so KMM is\nnow expressing key management systems as high-level protocols in order to apply CPSA.\nThe KMM researchers have been working with Mitre, and changes to CPSA have already\nbeen made to enable it to be applied to KMM more directly.\n\nAdditionally, KMM is being used for the first time to model a real-world key\nmanagement system. The United Kingdom (UK) is designing a new key management\narchitecture as part of its Secure Management Infrastructure (SMI) effort. The initial UK\narchitecture is simple enough to make it a good candidate for modeling while still allowing\nanalysis to be accomplished on a real system. Furthermore, the UK has its own project to\nproduce a formal specification of the key management architecture in Z, which will provide\ninvaluable input to KMM. A draft model is currently under development, and if sufficient\nprogress is achieved, R21 will be presenting the results at the 5-Eyes Key Management\nStrategy Group (KMSG) in Ottawa in October 2008.\n\n\n(U) IA Engineering Exchange:\n\nFor general information on R22 1A Engineering Research?s capabilities and\n\ncurrent efforts, please visit the R2 web sit_ or use the R22\nwiki link \n\n(U) The Research Journey from Passion to Prototype\n\nAs noted in the NIARL Director?s introduction, Research Integration (R223) is\nthe NIARL Focus Area responsible for taking 1A discoveries into the research prototype and\ndemonstration stage. Along the way, the team explores and addresses critical assurance\nchallenges facing our current information infrastructure, as well as those emerging against our\nfuture systems.\n\nTo explore the goals of Research Integration, let?s follow some distinct research\n\nefforts from their origins toward the integrated prototype and demonstration stage. For this\nexample, we?ll use a well-understood assurance problem given our current operational\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\nenvironment of multiple networks at various security levels namely, the need for users to\naccess multiple systems (also known as domains) in a secure way.\n\nThe central purpose of most research is to explore what?s ?next.? Instead of a\nknown desired end-state, this process often begins with a question, such as ?are there better\napproaches to secure software?? - many ideas are then tested to try to find the answer. That\nparticular question remains central to R213 High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS)\nFocus Area research into how Formal Methods and mathematical proofs could ensure the\n?correctness? of software design. In this example, the HCSS team explored possible solutions\nand eventually developed a small-scale, Java-based proof-of-concept.\n\nMeanwhile, in other areas of NIARL, another question was being asked within\nthe Authentication team, ?how can commercial smart card technologies be leveraged to\nprovide assured identity for access to sensitive systems?? Over the years, smart cards (and\nsmart card chipsets) rapidly progressed from their origins storing monetary value for\nEuropean pay phones, to then becoming unique identifiers for mobile phones, and ultimately\nfinding use as personal identification (and even user authentication for unclassified\nsystems). As the technology evolved, 1A research explored approaches to leverage these\ntechnologies toward our goals. But that sparked other questions, such as ?what do we do\nabout software from unknown or risky sources??\n\nThe moment came from a convergence of these two problem sets\ncourtesy of the Java Card standard for smart cards. Could Formal Methods lead to a proven\nJava-based operating system and provide assurance for commercially-based smart cards? In\npartnership with HCSS, Research Integration took the Formal Methods proof-of-concept\napproach and applied it to the real-world smart card problem. The lofty goal? Assured (and\nunclassified) multi-domain tokens for community identity and authentication.\n\nThe resulting Tokens Assurance Software research within Research Integration\njust completed the prototype of a functional and mathematically proven Java Card operating\nsystem. In addition, these software assurance techniques were expanded to develop tools to\ncreate assured applets to run on the cards. We will also soon complete some advanced\nhardware prototypes featuring physical protection concepts which will further demonstrate the\n?integrated? potential for how to provide strong authentication for access to critical systems.\n\nTo extend the concept, Research Integration will leverage additional NIARL\nexploration into yet another pressing 1A research question, ?how can virtualization\ntechnologies provide the foundation for future trusted computing platforms?? In partnership\nwith fellow Focus Areas, Research Integration is prototyping early versions of these\napproaches to investigate how they could enable assured information sharing, authentication\nand access control, as well as mobility for users. In this way, the initial breakthroughs of\nsoftware assurance, secure tokens, and platform trust could start to create answers to real\noperational questions, such as ?How can we transform the way user identity is protected to\nenable cross-community collaboration??\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\nSo while ?passion? for 1A discovery is not unique to Research Integration, our\nobjective is to put these advanced technologies into a form that highlights their potential to\naddress significant assurance questions. No matter the origin, the potential technology\nsolutions that emerge from 1A research are designed for significant breakthrough. However, a\nparticular innovation, in and of itself, provides limited benefit unless it can advance the\nscience, solve a problem, and ultimately reach customers. The aim of the R223 Research\nIntegration team is to reach those customers and showcase the potential for NIARL research\nto become a decisive advantage against network adversaries.

A near?term\nchallenge is the demonstration of an optical logic gate operating at switching.\n\nThe second effort is the Extremely Shallow Quantum Well Symmetric Self\nElectro?Optic Effect Device (E or SEED). Sandia has successfully fabricated\nand tested a SEED interconnect, fabricated by diamond turning a moldable plastic. This\ninterconnect, with anti?reflection coatings, is predicted to attain close to 95% throughput. A\n40Gb/s SEED toggle was also reported, but not yet cascaded. A physical model for SEED\nswitching was devised and initial results suggest that the optical power for reliable cascade\nmay be 2?5x higher than anticipated.\n\nThe critical milestone (2Q FY10) for these technologies is the successful\ndemonstration of a 3?bit 40Gb/s Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) research prototype.\nThis demonstration of Small?Scale Integration (SS1) should provide sufficient data to enable\nan assessment of the scalability and ultimate clock rate of the technologies. The majority of\nthis work is performed in Sandia's Microsystems and Engineering Science Applications\n(MESA) facility, expected to gain certification soon by the Trusted Access Program Office\n(TAPO).\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\nPOC: R222, \n\n(UIIFOUO) Sandia Trip Highlights R225?s Anti-Tamper Research Progress\n\nUse of commercial components in a high assurance solution for national security\napplications will require physical protection mechanisms. In the past, with government built\nsolutions, anti?tamper was part of the design and manufacture process. Today, use of COTS\nwill require the government to apply these protections after production. R225?s Intelligent\nReaction Anti?Tamper (AT) research program showcased the ability to provide these physical\nprotection mechanisms at a recent program review at Sandia National Laboratories.\n\nSeveral key technologies were demonstrated:\n- Multi?layer conformal AT on printed circuit boards with integrated control logic;\n- iPhones with hard aftermarket device encapsulation; and\n0 Chip packages retrofitted with active anti?tamper capability, including internal power.\n\nRemaining FY08 research into conformal AT technology will support R223?s\nsecure token effort. Starting in FY09, 1823 will assume full responsibility for further\ndevelopment of this AT technology as a part of R225?s partnerships forged to realize a full\nlife cycle: from research through implementation. R225 and 1823 are working together to\nadvance the aftermarket device encapsulation technology to the same level of technical\nreadiness, with NUCLEARWINTER team as a potential initial customer.

FLOWBEE is a spin-off of the POPQUIZ\nproject, which collects network metadata on high bandwidth protocols such as HTTP, SMTP,\nand DNS. FLOWBEE uses novel techniques to efficiently recognize and discard duplicate\nrelations, significantly reducing the volume of saved data. This data reduction, in\ncombination with the highly efficient POPQUIZ2 processing framework, allows FLOWBEE\nto collect metadata for every session on high-speed links.\n\nThis rich and varied dataset provided fertile ground for their explorations in large\ngraph analysis and characterization. Led by Technical Directors from R1 and R6, participants\nfocused on finding malicious activity in the data, modeling graphs produced by the\nFLOWBEE data, and investigating high-performance computing architectures to determine\ntheir applicability to processing FLOWBEE data and related large graph problems.\n\nAs the problem supporters for GMP, R23?s D10 team provided data, loaded and\nindexed the data in a database, and installed the FLOWBEE Surf web interface in the\nlab.

The flexible mandatory\naccess controls supported by the Flask architecture enable the confinement of flawed and\nmalicious applications and the enforcement of confidentiality, integrity, least privilege, and\nassured invocation goals. The Flask architecture has been successfully applied to several\nother operating systems via the SELinux, SEBSD, and SEDarwin projects as well as to other\nsoftware components such as hypervisors (Xen), windowing systems (X), and database\nsystems (PostgreSQL).\n\n(U) The initial FMAC code base was contributed by the NSA to OpenSolaris based on a\nversion of the Flask code that predated any involvement by the Linux community. This code\nwas then integrated into the OpenSolaris code and adapted by_ a Sun engineer\nwho is the co-lead of the FMAC project. This code was first released publicly on the FMAC\nproject web site in May 2008. When built, it produced a policy compiler and a kernel capable\nof loading the resulting policy into the security server.\n\n(U) Since that first release, joint development by the NSA and by Sun Microsystems has\nproceeded rapidly. Support for new system calls was introduced in June 2008, and support\nfor labeling processes was introduced in July 2008. Several utilities have been created for\ncontrolling and interacting with the system. Current design and implementation discussions\nare focusing on how to best support file security labeling in OpenSolaris, particularly for the\nZFS filesystem. Once file labeling is supported, the next steps will include support for\ndomain transitions and permission checks on process and file operations. This will provide a\nbase capability that can be used both to demonstrate the benefits of Flask and to further\ndevelop the remaining support for object labeling and mandatory controls.\n\nPoe:?\n\n12\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, CBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\n(UIIFOUO) R23 Contributes Behavioral Anomaly Detection to IDAICCS\nDISTILLERY SCAMP\n\nThe 2008 Summer Conference on Applied Mathematical Problems (SCAMP)\nwas hosted this summer in Bowie, MD at the This SCAMP focused on a specific\ncategory of attacks and intrusions targeted against US. critical national infrastructure.\nCommonly known in the community as the BYZANTINE HADES (BH) attacks, these\nintrusions are believed to originate from the People?s Republic of China. The main goals of\nthe SCAMP were to define and implement novel behavioral-based techniques that could\nbetter detect and respond to the wide array of BH attacks. R23?s POPQUIZ framework\nprovided the analytical applications to identify behavioral anomalies while DISTILLERY\nprovided the stream-based platform from which to execute these applications.\n\nA key factor to the success of the SCAMP was the availability of the SPADE\nprogramming language. Developed by IBM, SPADE enables the rapid development and\nprototyping of distributed stream-processing applications. Utilizing this language requires\nlittle programming expertise, as applications are described using high-level stream-centric\nconstructs.

    "doc_text": "TOP SECRET\nDiscovery\nJoint Collaboration Activity\n20 January 2011\n\nActivity Owners\nNSA\nGCHQ\n\nOverview\n\nOur Internet Exploitation capability is built upon our ability to effectively conduct\ntarget development and target discovery from IP data. One target discovery strategy\nis to spot patterns of Internet activity (communications, web browsing, web searching,\netc) from which infer suspicious behaviour or intent. Developing Target\nDetection Identifiers (TDIs), Internet presence data and other key metadata elements\nare critical enablers for achieving success.\n\nThe spread of particularly Transport Layer Security (TLS), which was\npreviously known as Security Sockets Layer (SSL), and Internet Protocol Security\nthreatens our ability to do effective target discovery/development because\npertinent metadata events will be locked within the channels and difficult, if\nnot impossible, to prise out.\n\nThese activities are designed to get a sound understanding of the threat that\nbrings to our ability to do target discovery/development as well as devising\nmitigations that will (hopefully) allow our Internet Exploitation strategy to prevail.\n\nPlan\n\nPerforming discovery within and beyond will require new solutions. We\nwill be investigating and creating solutions in these areas:\n\n1. Monitor the prevalence of usage within technologies \nvpn, etc) and across the Internet and into our SIGINT targets? domain. The\nquestions we would like to get into a position to answer are:\n\na. What percentage of are we seeing in all traffic? What is the\ntrend over time?\n\nb. What percentage of traffic is associated with a target? Trends?\n\nc. What percentage of targets are using TLS, or other \ntechnologies? Trends?\n\nd. How are these figures above broken out across the web\nservices available (webmail, web searches, geo mapping, web fora, IM,\nsocial networking, online shopping, online banking, etc)? Split out the\nwebmail stats per provider. Trends?\n\ne. What are the most common sites visited (in all traffic)? Trends?\n\nWhat are the most common sites visited by targets? What is the\n\nprofile of usage? Trends?\n\n?h\n\nDerived From: NSAICSSIVI 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20360101\nTOP SECRET\n\nTOP SECRET\n\n2. Assess the threat of to our current exploitation capabilities and to our future\nintent\n\na. Which of our presence and communications metadata (including TDIs) will\nbe lost under channels?\n\nb. What is the impact of this loss to our Target Discovery and Target\nDevelopment tradecraft?\n\nc. What is the impact of this loss to our ability to cross-correlate TDIs and run\nmore complex queries against our data?\n\n3. Understand and improve our pairing rates within an access and between access\npoints?\n\na. What can be paired from what can be viewed?\n\nb. What could be paired between sites (demonstrate correlation between\ncollaboration environment and TICKETWINDOW sites for example)?\n\nc. What are the volumes of paired links and would our CA\nservices be able to handle these?\n\nd. Can we optimise our passive collection by analysing pairing rates per\ncountry and per service level?\n\ne. How can the cloud enable better pairing by leveraging it?s ability to look\nover time?\n\n4. Research new methods for maintaining an effective TD tradecraft and mitigating\nthe threat of traffic.\n\na. Are there other TDIs or ?TDI-like? identifiers we can develop that can\nidentify users or machines of interest, despite our targets using How\neffective are these? are the TDIs persistent across sessions, do they\nuniquely identify a user or machine, do we always appear in user\nsessions?)\n\nb. Can we characterise sessions from ESP metadata analysis \nusing duration, packet length, burstiness)?\n\nc. How can we best analyze VPN traffic to develop effective TD\ntradecraft for VPNs.\n\nd. Can we use Internet presence or communications metadata with network\nanalysis techniques to identify high-value sessions? (gah: do you think this\nsits better under (3) above?)\n\ne. Can we combine knowledge from session processing and content with\nmetadata to enable better methods.\n\nAcquire an understanding for how much more challenging (or easier!) this problem is\nin the Mobile Internet context, and whether any of the mitigations from (4) above lend\nthemselves to discovering targets behind Mobile Gateways.\n\n20f3\n\nTlus Is exempt lrom disclosure urrder the Freedom ol lrrlormauorr Act 2000 mar be sub ect to exem )trorr urrder\nother UK legislatrorr. Reler disclosure requests to GCHQ orr\n\nTOP SECRET\n\n \n \n\nTOP SECRET\n\nTechnical Requirements\n\nThe ability to understand and track as well as develop new methods as\noutlined above requires the use of existing metadata from NSA and GCHQ\nprocessing system, the ability to create new metadata to test the viability of it?s use\nfor the creation of new methods and to enhance existing data, the ability to correlate\nacross what is known (strongly selected content) with metadata and potentially the\nability to examine deeper into sessions for evaluation of exploitability.

LONGHAUL receives information (CA Data) from the ?eld systems\nand passes information back to ?eld systems using its Front End. The Front End validates the\nsender/receiver using CASPORT services. LONGHAUL contains Attack Orchestration\ncomponents (one orchestrator for each distinct type of attack), and Attack Service components.\nAttack orchestration ?gures out what processing should be applied for each piece of\nCA Data, and then initiates, and as needed manages, that processing. Attack service performs the\nattack. Once the processing is complete, the result is returned to the attack\norchestration component, information about the processing is \"saved\" for Management and\nAnalysis, and then as appropriate the result is returned to the \"requesting\" CA Server.\nLONGHAUL accesses CES Databases for certain information needed for attack orchestration and\nattack services. LONGHAUL also provides an interface for CES that need access to\ninformation pertaining to the LONGHAUL processed data. LONGHAUL maintains its own internal\ndatabases for the management and control of its processing activities.\n\n    LONGHAUL Architecture mam\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\nCA Rmurtu\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThus anagram has been fat readabuhty \nsites are deployed and all connechons mm are siwwn\ngoing [0 ONE 5318 r93\")? 90 [0 Wm .t-mauil 1 RH rm mm u: .\"1?I4llu\n\nLONGHAUL End-to?End Overview\n\nLONGHAUL (in Purge_Surge parlance) is a Collection Store, that is a \"system that\nprocesses and/or retains collected SIGINT data items, and that permits access to those\nperforming collection functions and limits access of those performing intelligence analysis\".\nLONGHAUL maintains internal databases that contain \"technical data\", and\nLONGHAUL also exchanges \"technical data\" with other CES databases and with\nCES HPC resources that perform attacks. This \"technical data\" includes recovered\n\n2of15\n\nLONG HAUL - WikiInfo\n\nkeys, information about what processing is appropriate, data needed for \nattacks, as well as information retained to enable future attacks. LONGHAUL does\nnot store cipher data or ever have access to data. If the \"technical data\" passed to\nAttack Service components or CES databases contains information from the collected stream (as\nopposed to information about the collected stream such as SIGAD, DTOI), then appropriate\nCritical Identifying Information (CII) will be passed also. From a compliance perspective this is\nthe system being \"certi?ed\".\n\nField deployed collection systems and CA Servers (also known as Extended\nLONGHAUL) are shown on the left. A CA Server is the ?eld CES component that runs CA\nServices. The terms CA Server or CA Services are used depending on the context\n(hardware/software). For information on CA Server deployments see the wiki pages\nCA Servers and for information on CA Server\narchitecture see Server. The CA Server stores cipher data, and it based\nupon a key returned by LONGHAUL.\n\nLONGHAUL is a High Availability system using hardware at two geographically\ndistributed locations to also provide a COOP capability. LONGHAUL uses the Application\nMessaging Framework AMF with the ISLANDTRANSPORT transport and\nISLANDHIDEAWAY (IH) integrity and privacy capabilities to send data between collection\nsystems and LONGHAUL. The requestor of CA Services (the ?eld deployed CA Server) never\nknows (or needs to know) which hardware is used to process its requests. LONGHAUL and the\nAMF manage the physical routing and failover behavior of the system.\n\nLONGHAUL has a Service-Oriented, Java-Based Enterprise Architecture. It includes\nmultiple coordinated software development efforts. Each Attack Orchestrator is a major\ndevelopment effort, as are the Management and Analysis and Security and Policy\ncomponents. LONGHAUL also has a hardware acquisition component, and manages the\ninterfaces and integration activities with (collection), and the High\nPerformance Computing (HPC) activities of 5. The LONGHAUL team is responsible for all\nphases of development, starting with requirements, thorough design, technology selection,\ndevelopment, integration, system test, and deployment. The team is also responsible for the\nsystem engineering and hardware design and acquisition to support a two-site, high-availability\nsystem.\n\nIn July 2010, T1, T5 and CES signed an SLA for \"the provisioning and support of\n(CA) Services within the TURBULENCE Passive Collection Suite (TU \n\nAttack Orchestration\n\nPOISONNUT\n\nPOISONNUT is a Child LONGHAUL\nProject that enables Data Network Cipher (DNC) Recovery. Initial Customer Capability was\nreleased on September 30, 2009. (DNC) was determined Jan. 2011.\n\nSCARLETFEVER\nSCARLETFEVER is a Child\n\nLONGHAUL Project that enables Data Network Session Cipher (DNSC) Recovery. Initial\nCustomer Capability was achieved in December 201 0.\n\n(U) Management and Analysis\n\n(U) For this very high level view our diagram shows Management and Analysis as one block.\nThis block contains many components and further details can be found on the Software\nArchitecture page.\n\n(U) Additionally, LONGHAUL has begun to create a set of web applications for Management\n\n30f15\n\nLONG HAUL - WikiInfo\n\n(Operations and Mission) and Mission Analysis which can be found here: Web Applications List\n\n\n(U) Security and Policy\n\nSPAM is our Security, Policy, and Adjudication Module which will be used to apply\nrules for sanitizing, ?ltering, and determining if a response should be sent to a particular client.\n\n(U) Common\n\nAll child projects share LONGHAUL COMMON components or services. This is not\nshown as a separate block on the diagram as all the components use COMMON.\n\n(U) Interfaces (ICD)\n\n(U) All Interfaces are described on the ICD wiki page. These include both the external interfaces\n(how a CA Server communicates with LONGHAUL) as well as the interfaces LONGHAUL uses\nwith other CES systems.\n\n(U) Design\n(U) Architecture\n\nSoftware and Hardware architecture discussions are available on the LONGHAUL\nArchitecture page.\n\n(U) High Availability\n\nLONGHAUL is a high availability system that makes use of Continuity of Operations\n(COOP) to meet availability requirements. The system is designed from both hardware and\nsoftware perspectives to provide high availability, ensuring that key recovery services are always\navailable. The two site deployment with equal processing capacity will meet the COOP\nrequirement for the system. Each system is designed with redundant hardware and processes so\nthat the system can survive any single component (hardware or software) failure. During normal\noperation, both systems will be operational and share the processing load. In the event of a single\nsite failure, the second site will, within seconds, assume total processing responsibility, but at\nreduced capacity. The requestor of CA Services (the ?eld deployed CA Server) never knows (or\nneeds to know) which hardware is used to process its requests. CA Servers send data to\nLONGHAUL and receive responses from LONGHAUL using the AMF. LONGHAUL and the AMF\nmanage the physical routing and failover behavior of the system.\n\nFor more detailed information, see Availability Analysis.\n(U) JMS Messaging\n\nThe use of a high capacity, low latency JMS messaging fabric is critical to the success\nof the LONGHAUL mission. LONGHAUL has worked closely with the Application Messaging\nFramework (AMF) team to design a fabric to support the LONGHAUL requirements.\n\n(U) See AMF LONGHAUL Teaming for more detailed information.\n\nThe collection site clients (CA Servers) will publish messages into the fabric with no\nknowledge of where the processing actually occurs. The fabric should support both active/active\nand active/passive processing modes. In active/active mode multiple sites would consume the\nsame message, and manage the client response strategy. In active/passive, one site would\nconsume a message, but in a failure mode, an alternate site would seamlessly pick up message\n\n4of15\n\nLONG HAUL - Wikilnfo\n\nconsumption.\n(U) Deployment\n(U) Hardware\n\nLON GHAUL is composed of almost identical hardware at two geographically\ndistributed sites - the Tordella Supercomputer Building (TS CB) at Fort Meade and Oak Ridge\nData Center (ORDC) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The initial hardware con?gurations for TS CB and\nORDC arrived in November 2009 and May 2010 respectively. The ?nal con?gurations arrived in\nJan 201 1 at both sites. A system, termed IIHadoop ClusterII has also been purchased to produce\nanalytics and store metrics for LON GHAUL. The Hadoop Cluster will reside at ORDC and is\nscheduled to be delivered in April 201 1. CAVIUM is being considered for CA Server.\n\n(U) For more detailed information, see Hardware Description and Schedule.\n\n(U) Software Releases\n\nLONGHAUL 3.4.0 was released on February 27, 2013.

Currentiy, virtually\nall is carried out by PTD processing with going to\nthe HS in the |I'Sol; some are placed in the ENDUE |I'Sol due to\nthe sensitivity or fragility of the exploitation capability.\n\nIn recent years there has been an aggressive effort; lead by NSA, to make major\nimprovements in defeatng network security and privacy involving multiple\nsources and methods, all of which are extremely sensitive and fragile. These\ninclude: Computer Network Exploitation collaboration with other\nIntelligence Agencies; investment in high?performance computers; and\ndevelopment of advanced mathematical techniques. Several ECI compartments\nmay apply to the specific sources, methods, and techniques involved.\n\nlvlaking the best use of these new capabilities requires that processing\nbe widely deployed beyond PTD and the results of that processing be available to\nawide range of This inevitably makes it harder to protect this sensitive\nand fragile capability and we need to counterbalance this by introducing\nmeasures to control access to this material and heighten awareness of the\nsensitivities amongst those who have access.\n\nTo achieve this, NSA has introduced the BULLRUN |I'Sol to protect our abilities to\ndefeat the used in network communication technologies.

    "doc_text": "TOP \n\nUser?s Guide For PRISM Skype Collection\n\nAugust 2012\nPOC For Document:_ 53531\n\n1. F) Introduction\na. PRISM Skype collection can be identified by the following:\n\na.i. SIGAD: US-984XN (this SIGAD is used for all PRISM collection, notjust\nSkype collection).\n\na.ii. Case Notation: where the represents a wildcard.\n\nb. Sustained Skype collection began in Feb 2011 against ?in and out? modes; this is\nthe mode in which one end of the call is using a Skype application, and the other\nend is using a landline, or cell phone, without a Skype application. This is audio\nonly. PRISM collection added exploitation against peer-to-peer Skype applications\nin July 2011. In this mode, both/all users are using the Skype application. This can\nbe a mixture of audio, video, chat, and file transfers. PRISM collection can be from\nboth modes of communication; however, there is no distinction made in the Case\nNotation.\n\nc. PRISM collection is available for ?surveillance? tasking in UTT. There is no ?stored\ncomms? or ?search? capability for tasking.\n\n2. F) Questions on tasking Skype Selectors to PRISM:\na. Can I task something other than SkypeUser?\n\na.i. No - this is your only option for Skype selectors in PRISM. You cannot task\nskypeMailToken.\n\nb. Do I need to include a V-Sen'es zipcode?\n\nb.i. Yes. When you submit FAA Skype requirements, please remember to include\na V?series zipcode otherwise, voice content will not be routed to\nNUCLEON.\n\nDerived From: 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20361001\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nc. Can a Skype user have more than one skypeMailToken?\n\nc.i. Yes - they can link 2 or more email addresses to their each has a\ncorresponding skypeMailToken. You can query DECODEORDAIN to find out\nwhat e-mail address they correlate to.\n\nd. Is there any bene?t (or harm) to tasking both the SkyUser and SkypeHash for\nthe same user to \n\nd.i. Tasking a SkypeUser automatically tasks the SkypeHash to UTT. The only\ntime you need to explicitly task a SkypeHash is when you don't know what\nthe correlated SkypeUser is querying DECODEORDAIN with the\n\nSkypeHash fails to return a correlated SkypeUser, and after you've contacted\n\nnd they fail to find a correlated SkypeUser).\n\n  \n\n3. Questions on locating Skype PRISM data:\n\na. How do I find Skype data in \n\na.i. Best way to query in PINWALE is by DecodeOrdain enriching your target's\nSkype username, as follows:\n\na.i.l. Enter the Skype username in the PINWALE query form, right\nclick on the username that you've typed-in and click ?DecodeOrdain?\nthen ?Apply?\n\na.i.2. Pick ?SkypeUser? from the ?choose realm? pull-down list and\nclick OK\n\na.i.3. You'll now see a screen like the one attached. Pick which ever\npermutations you want (or just leave them all checked to get\neverything), and click \n\na.i.4. submit your search\n\nb. How do I locate Skype collection using DE \n\nb.i. Attached is a screen-shot of how you can use DECODEORDAIN to find\nSkype video chat content.\n\nTOP \n\n \n\nTOP \n\n \n\nsates;\n\n \n\nL'?l?l?lrl'li\n\nDECODEORDAIN r11 urr'led 5 perrnmul-u-nt for me realm or.

By selecting the \"General Skype\" permutation, you will query all\nSkype PRISM traffic (regardless of whether there is any content or not\n\n\nb.i.2. By selecting only the \"Skype Chat\" permutation, you will narrow\nthe query to only Skype PRISM traffic that contains Instant Messaging\ncontent\n\nb.i.3. By selecting only the \"Skype Webcam\" permutation, you will\nnarrow the query to only Skype PRISM traffic that contains at least\none visible video stream\n\nb.ii. Please note that when MARINA says that a SkypeUser webcammed with\nanother that event *did* actually happen - but the content may not be\nvisible in PINWALE (because part of the video stream may have been lost,\nprohibiting us from being able to reconstruct the video). If you want to look\nfor PINWALE documents that have webcams that are actually visible, you\n\ncan use the PINWALE query option, described\nabove.\n\nc. My Skype PINWALE cut says URA Skype\" - what does that mean?\nc.i. The display name is Skype\" for both the UIS Text Presenter\n\nand the DNI Presenter. The DNI Presenter and UIS Text Presenter both\nhave the capability to display Chat, File Transfers, and Video. The\nDNI Presenter has a single combined display for SKYPE webcam that allows\nthe user to play the video and audio together in a mode or\nindividually. Within UIS, the user will need to use UIS Hotzone to play the\ncorresponding audio cuts.\n\nd. How do search for Skype data in \n\nTOP \n\nd.i.\n\nTOP \n\nYou can query by case notation where wildcard), or you can query\nby username in the field (note that if your target\nhas a long username, you may have trouble searching by username due to\nlength limitations in but you won't have any trouble searching\nby case notation in NUCLEON).\n\n Another way to pull up the audio in NUCLEON is to pull on the zipcode that\n\nthe audio was sent to. If you pull it up this way, the Skype audio displays\nalong with the rest of the FAA audio that was sent to the same zipcode.\n\ne. Where's the other side of my voice cut in \n\ne.i.\n\nCES has added a great new service for OPls on PRISM (and FBI FISA)\nvoice collection: all voice cuts will now be autopaired and you will not have to\nhunt down the other side of phone calls. You will automatically be presented\nwith both sides of the conversation in NUCLEON. Previously, would\nhave to search through NUCLEON to find both sides by looking at the\ntargets and the timestamps to guess which ones are paired.\n\nf. Where?s the audio to go with my Skype video?\n\nf.i.\n\nWithin the DNI Presenter (DNIP), the user can utilize the ?View Associations?\nservice to find the associated NUCLEON audio of the PINWALE document\nor find the associated PINWALE document of the NUCLEON audio. In other\nwords, you can find the MAM and/or TAM associations to any associated\nSkype data, and then display them within the DNIP Skype combined display\nor the DNIP Composite display. Also from the UIS Text Presenter, you can\nlaunch the DNI Presenter to utilize this ?View Associations? service.\n\n9. How Do I Tell When Stored/Search Comms Arrive From \n\ng.i.\n\nThere is no collection capability for Stored/Search Comms in Skype PRISM.\n\nh. Why do I receive multiple copies of Skype chat sessions?\n\nh.i.\n\nYou might get chats in segments and then get the whole chat in a third\ncollect. This is how Skype works. Depending upon what your target is doing,\na copy of his chat history can be sent in-bulk (which can span multiple chat\nsessions). If you target, for example, has 3 separate chat sessions with\nanother individual on his laptop, then logs-into his Skype account on his\ndesktop, the chat-history of those 3 separate chat sessions will be\ntransmitted from this laptop to his desktop so that both his computers have a\nlog of the whole conversation.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ni. What does ?0 Frames Available? mean in my Skype video results?\n\nWhenever you see this in PINWALE: ?Stream 1 has 0 frames available? or\n?Stream 2 has 0 frames available?, it means that we know that a video-feed\nwas taking place, but we didn't get enough traffic to reconstruct any video\nframes. Either the target was unable to get a video feed up, or too much\ntraffic was lost during the collection process to reconstruct any images.\n\nj. Why are so many e-mail addresses correlated to one Skype user account?\n\nj.i.\n\nThese are probably all valid associations. Skype does not require that a user enter\na \"valid\" email address when creating a Skype account (which establishes their\nskypeMailTokens). A simple email address like \"abed@hotmail.com\" is likely to be\nrandomly picked by a large population of Skype users when creating their\nso it's not unreasonable to find a lot of correlations. You will likely find a\nsimilarly high correlation count for something like \"abc@hotmail.com\" or\n\"asdf@hotmail.com\" or These are not false these users\n*did* enter this email address when creating their Skype but a lot ofthem\nprobably did so to maintain their anonymity by typing in something simple \nrandom, rather than their true email address.\n\nk. What's wrong with the timestamps in my Skype data?\n\nk.i.\n\nThis is due to 2 reasons:\n\n1) Skype sends chunks of old conversations to conversation\nhistories across multiple Skype installations. DNI Presenter UIS attempt to\ndetect \"historic conversation dumps\" and label them as such (but keep in\nmind these conversation histories can be quite days or weeks - so it's\nimportant to pay close attention to the timestamps).\n\n2) There are 2 timestamps displayed in UIS DNI Presenter for Skype. The\nfirst is the collection time, and the second is the target's local computer time.\nDNI Presenter displays them properly as \"Collection Time (G and \"User\nworkstation time Please note that NSA has no control over the \"User\nworkstation a target could decide to set his local computer's clock\nmonths or years off from the true time.\n\nI. Why do sometimes have to piece together a lot of chat sessions from Skype?\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nH. The reason why you're seeing pieces of Skype chats in different documents is for 3\nreasons:\n\n1) the data is too big, and is being fragmented into multiple documents (this isn't\nthat common, however)\n\n2) Skype sends chunks of old conversations to conversation histories\nacross multiple Skype installations. These old conversations are sent piecemeal\nacross multiple chat sessions.\n\n3) Every time a Skype user disconnects from Skype, and reconnects again - they\nbeing a new session. It's common to see Skype users disconnect reconnect\nfrequently whenever Skype stops performing well for them if their video or\naudio messes up, it's common to see a Skype user disconnect reconnect to get it\nworking again). Every time they do this, a new PINWALE document is started.\n\nItems 2 and 3 are based entirely on target behavior (it's not a collection problem,\nand is not being introduced by NSA).\n\nm. Why does my Skype playback get out of sync?\n\nmi. The main issue is data-loss causing the audio to skip and fall-behind. CES is\nworking on a few techniques to help keep the audio in-sync between channels and\nwith the video (the video should always be since we timestamp each video\nframe).\n\n4. Questions on miscellaneous issues:\n\na. How do I find out the e-mail address of my Skype target? The collection only\ngives me the Skypeuser, SkypeNode and SkypeMailToken.\n\na.i. Email addresses are not included in Skype skypeMailTokens\n(which are derived from email addresses) are. You can search MARINA for\nskypeMailToken - to - SkypeUser correlations to detect a username change,\nin order to put new SkypeUser selectors up on FAA coverage. You can also\ntransform any email address into a skypeMailToken using\nDECODEORDAIN. DECODEORDAIN can also transform some\nskypeMailTokens back into email addresses. For cases where\nDECODEORDAIN cannot transform a skypeMailToken into an email address\n- please send an email to and request that they attempt\nto recover the email address from the skypeMailToken (however, please only\ndo this if DECODEORDAIN fails to return the email address).\n\n \n\nb. Can we collect Skype voicemail?\nb.i. If a target connects via a peer-to-peer connection, we will not be able to\ncollect any voicemail he receives or sends. If a target connects via a PSTN\nconnection and uses his ln/Out number to communicate with another user's\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nln/Out number, then we will collect voicemails. Both of these scenarios only\napply to surveillance collection. We do not have any stored comms collection\nfrom Skype at this time.\n\nl/O is a telephone number assigned by Skype. You can use either your\nSkype ID or your l/O number to make/receive calls. If you're only making\nP2P calls you don't need an l/O assigned. You only need an l/O number if\nyou want to make calls to/from the PSTN. Note you can also make l/O to l/O\ncalls, which must hit a PSTN switch of some type.\n\nc. What happens when both sides of a Skype call are tasked selectors?\n\nc.i.\n\nPRISM should collect two copies of the communication. This is true unless\none of the users' Skype communications falls into one of a couple of\ntechnical limitations which prevents us from currently collecting via PRISM.\n\nd. Why did I receive small and incomplete files from Skype collection?\n\nd.i.\n\nThe first 256 bytes of a document for transfer are sent so that the Skype\nclient can figure out what type of file it is (a PDF verses a JPEG). It shows-up\non the user's Skype chat window as a message that says something like \"so\nand so is attempting to sent you a click here to etc.\". If the\nuser doesn't choose to download it, then you will not receive the entire file,\nbut only this first nibble of data, which might include the filename.\n\n Also, due to known limitations in our collection process, some larger size\n\nfiles being transferred by targets may be not be fully collected. There is no\nstored comms capability to go back and retrieve these files.\n\ne. How does the Skype Credential CRC work and what will I see in collection?\n\ne.i.\n\nThe way Skype works, users (in the raw data) are represented by their\nSkype Credential CRC (SkypeCredCRC). Usually the data contains enough\ninformation such that we can figure out what SkypeUser maps to the\nbut sometimes this isn't possible. SkypeCredCRC's are\ntemporary so they're not targetable. Normally don't\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nhave to worry about SkypeCredCRC's, because CES Protocol Exploitation is\nable to map them to but there are a handful of edge cases\nwhere they don't have enough information to do so. Also, a SkypeUser can\nhave more than 1 SkypeCredCRC associated with them. So - the possibility\nthat a SkypeCredCRC shows-up in your collection and is associated with\none of the already-existing communicants in the collection is a very possible\n(although it's not universally true). CES only ?holds-up? collection for a\ncertain period of time before they give-up trying to figure-out how to map an\nunknown SkypeCredCRC to a SkypeUser (12 hours would be too that\nwould build-in a 12-hour delay into all Skype collection before you got to see\n\nit). If you run into a Sk eCredCRC and cannot figure out who it is, just send\nan email to and someone (either in PE, or\n880) can try and figure-out if we (or the FBI) has learned the correlation\n\nafter-the-fact. It is not possible for you to see the correlation in the raw data.\nis used to mask the correlation.\n\nf. How does Skype work?\n\nf.i. Skype is a true ?peer to peer? communications are not routed\nbetween central servers - they are only routed between Skype users \n?peers?). NSA receives Skype collection via PRISM when one of the peers is\na tasked target.\n\nThere are 3 collection scenarios:\nA) target other_person\nB) other_person target\n\nC) target same_target\n\nScenario A and occur when a target is communicating with another\nindividual. This communication may not be very interesting it might not\nbe an IM, Voice, or it may just be a request to retrieve that\nindividual's Avatar to but there was *some* type communication\nbetween these two users, and the target is a party to that communication.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nScenario is an interesting case -- it implies that the target is talking to\nhimself. In fact, he This scenario occurs when the target uses 2 different\ndevices laptop and mobile phone, or laptop desktop, etc.), and is\nlogged in from both devices at the same time.\n\nThese 2 devices will automatically with each other, and transmit\ninformation between them (including past communications that the target\nwas a party to).\n\nNow - when it comes to multi-parti communications (conference calls, multi-\nperson lMs, etc.), Skype is still a peer-to-peer protocol Skype\ncreates a mesh-network, where users are connected together through\nmultiple peer-to-peer links. Instant Messages sent to this group of meshed\nparticipants can be routed *through* any participant. For example, if A, B,\nand are chatting together in a conference chat, the peer-to-peer network\nmay look like this: A C. In this scenario, lM's from Ato and \nwill all be routed through B. If is our target, we will see these but is\na party to these - because they're multi-party (not private \nbetween A and C).\n\n5. F) Other Useful Resources:\na. Instructional Videos on KapShare Learning Portal\na.i. Go to this link:\n\nand type in ?Skype? in the Search box. You will see a list of short videos\nwhich describe different aspects of Skype exploitation. As of Nov 2011, the\nlist includes a primer on how Skype works, how to analyze Skype metadata,\nSkype in XKeyscore and other topics.\n\nb.

The NAC held a joint with \nOps (OP SOCIALIST II) to identify the huge extent of opportunity that this work has\nidentified. Work continues on a reduced number of ONE requirements.\n\nMERION ZETA (support for NEP and Ops teams): This surge which included\ncontributors from other areas - was a continuation of the involvement in the\nproject to exploit Belgacom's GRX network, as required by the Mobile Theme. This\nparticular surge, which was completed successfully, included efforts to: identify the\nmobile network operators that connect to the Belgacom network via \ncharacterise each VPN and determine those that contain GTP: facilitate the\n\nprocessing of these GTP events to enable the extraction and use of target selectors;\nconduct access analysis to identify the best point of access for the key networks;\nmake recommendations for further sustained GTFJ processing.\n\n- Successful VERACIOUS Project-enabling conducted; key requirements for upcoming work\nidenti?ed, which are key to reducing risk exposure. Network Analysis on BELGACOM hugely\nsuccessful enabling exploitation.\n\n"

You are being indoctrinated on SENTRY EAGLE, the and\ncompartrnented program protecting the highest and most\nsensitive level of information related to and support\nto the U.S. Government's efforts to protect America?s cyberspace. America?s\ncyberspace is the combination of U.S. National Security Systems, Military\nSystems, Intelligence Systems, Federal Government Systems, Critical\nInfrastructure Systems and all other U.S. systems (private industry, academia\nand private citizen.)\n\n. effort to protect America?s cyberspace encompasses the\ncombination of all abilities to detect nation and non-nation attacks on U.S.\ncyberspace via active and passive SIGINT and Information Assurance means.\nJFCC-NW's effort to protect America?s cyberspace encompasses the efforts to\nplan, and when tasked, attack an adversary?s cyber space via\nComputer Network Attack. The combination of these two e?'orts constitutes\nand Core Computer Network Operations (CNO)\nSecrets.\n\n. In order for and JFCC-NW to accomplish, along with\nother U.S. and foreign government agencies/elements, the protection of\nAmerica?s cyberspace, must combine the full capabilities of\nauthorized Computer Network Operations capabilities (SIGTNT, Computer\nNetwork Exploitation Information Assurance, Computer Network\nDefense (CND), and Network Warfare, Computer Network Attack \nand all supporting activities.\n\n. SENTRY EAGLE and its subordinate programs protect the\ncombined facts related to and abilities to conduct\nCNO operations. It encompasses the most sensitive aspects of \nrelationships with industry (U.S. and foreign) and the U.S. lnforrnation\nOperations/CNO community; ability to exploit cnciphered communications;\nability to conduct CN ability to conduct and, relationships with\nHuman Intelligence (HU MINT) Agencies.\n\n. These and JFCC-NW Core CNO Secrets are being\nprovided to you based upon your ?need to know\" as determined by the\nDirector, NSA/Chief, Central Security Service and Commander, JFCC-NW.\nWhile many of the facts in this brie?ng are contained in separate \nExceptionally Controlled Information (ECIs) or DOD Special Access\nPrograms (SAPS) structures, no other program combines the totality of all\nthese facts into one overarching program. The facts contained in this program\nconstitute a combination of the greatest number of highly sensitive facts\nrelated to overall mission. As such, depending upon\n\nTOP 10524\nDRAFT\n\n \n\n \n\nTOP 10524\nDRAFT\n\nyour mission necd-to-know or management position, you may be read on for\none, a combination of two or more, or all aspects of SENTRY EAGLE.\n\n.

Depending upon a speci?c fact, you may share\nsuch a fact with foreign partners as noted on the SENTRY EAGLE or\nsubordinate classi?cation guides as paragraph marked or within specific\nSAP or ECI channels. Under no circumstances will you share the\ntotality of SENTRY EAGLE nor facts that are marked NOFORN.\n\n. (S) SENTRY EAGLE material must be protected within this compartment and\ndiscussed only with cleared personnel on a need-tooknow basis. Disclosure of\nSENTRY EAGLE information to non-indoctrinated personnel may result in\ndisciplinary action to include criminal prosecution.

It has been agreed between OPA-TAS and PISECGIAS and iS to\nbe read by all officers prior to deployment overseas.\n\n1.1.2 It iS OPA-TAS policy for officers to adopt best practice in the use of covert\nmobile phones when deployed overseas in order to ensure both their own\npersonal security and operational security. This policy dictates the\nuse of FCO provided non-attributable official and personal mobile phones by\nofficers while on deployment.\n\n2. Operating Rules\n\n1.1.3 Official mobile phones are accountable items and must be Signed for when\ntaken from the OPA-TAS secure store.\n\n1.1.4 The mobile phones and the accessories must be returned to OPA-TAS on\nreturn to the UK. Failure to do so may preclude future travel.\n\n1.1.5 Official phones are to be used only for official business in country and\n\nMUST not be used to make personal calls to the UK. If a call iS unavoidable\nthen only out of area numbers can be called, these are:\n\n- GSOC OOA 0207\nTAS OOA 0207\n\n1.1.6 To avoid compromise the following must be adhered to:\n\n \n \n\nThe covert mobile phones are equipped with BLUETOOTH and therefore\nthey MUST not be switched on or used within a 50-mile radius of\nCheltenham and within this radius the battery must be removed from the\n\nphone.\n\n \n\nThe covert mobile phone MUST NOT be recharged at the officer?s home\naddress or at temporary residence eg a hotel room, if it iS within the 50\nmiles radius. If a phone needs to be charged then it iS acceptable to do\nso either at the airport or at your destination.\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 6\n\nSECRET\n\nTl?is ii?formatiOi? is exempt from disc osure Lmqer the Freedom of Ii?formatiOi?

Welfare\n\n1.1.8 It iS recognised that officers who are departing from, or have recently arrived\nin the UK may wish to advise family or friends of disruption to their travel\nplans. In such cases the officer must use payphones that are available in\nthe airport. If a phone iS not available at the airport, then during office hours\ncontact the OPA-TAS OOA number, who will pass on the message onto the\nfamily member.\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 6\n\nSECRET\n\nThis information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and may be subject to exemption\nunder other UK information legislation.

It has been ?lling gaps for the US-rnn Enrogean\n\nlof'j\n\nSecurity Operations Center's counterterrorism effort, as well as other\nAfrican missions, for over a year now**.

As a result, ESGG has been investigating possible Third Party\nrelationships to leverage partner accesses and linguistic capabilities. END is both a\ntrusted partner and a very modern and capable SIGINT service, which lessens\nconcerns about sharing capabilities and SIGINT selectors with this partner as\nopposed to other potential African partners. JSA's collection resources, as well as\nEND's oyerlapping requirements regarding North Africa, made JSA an obvious\nchoice to quickly respond to ESGG's requirements.\n\nJSA Collects Against Africa\n\nIn fall of EDGE, JSA began collecting email trafIic related to \nGSM infrastructure, producing a number of SIGDE?J-related reports. Then in the\nsummer ESGG requested that JSA perform a survey ofsin satellites in\nsearch of specific North African communications. During the course ofthe suryey,\nJSA located and initiated collection signals carrying \ncommunications. In October EDDT, ESGG issued its first GT SIGINT report from\nJSA's GSM [Global System for Mobile communications} collection. In addition to\n\nsupporting ESGG, JSA is now collecting? signals in support of\nNSAW's GT mission.\n\nOverlapping Requirements\n\nNSA and END have similar SIGINT requirements regarding Africa.\nEND has standing intelligence requirements for various political and humanitarian\nissues throughout Africa. END's current priorities in Africa are Sudan, Algeria, and\nSomalia. In Sudan, END is collecting two different GSM networks at another\nFGENSAT facility, and using the metadata to track targets. Germany is very\ninterested in the peace process in Darfur and southern Sudan. Regarding Algeria,\nEND has been processing border guard communications f'roijA collection, but\nthese signals appear to he migrating to a new data network, requiring a new\nprocessing capability. END HQs are eagerly awaiting a processing solution\nin order to more fully exploit these internal Algerian communications. For Somalia,\nGermany has forces in the Horn of Africa region supporting Operation Enduring\nFreedom, and is very interested in the political and humanitarian issues\nsurrounding Somalia.\n\nFuture\n\nNSA at JSA are working with GSRG [Collection Strategies and\n\nRequirements Genterll-Europe and Representatiye AFEIGDM to explore\nnew areas where JSA can support oyerlapping African SIGINT requirements from\n\nEof'j\n\nNSA and END.\n\nNotes:\n\nstands for \"Joint SIGINT Actiyity.\" It is operated by NSA and\nthe Eundesnachrichtendienst - German Foreign Intelligence Service} at the\n\nGerman SIGINT facility Mangfall Kaserne in anaria.

SUSLAG {formerly known as Combined\nGroup Germany} was compelled to ?nd a new home by the closure of its previous\nhost, Ead Aibling Station.\n\n(sasa? ?rst heips?{Chiefof\n\nEngineering and MaintenancefKE-EtllI piant a tree in Jfront ofthe new SUSLAG\n\nbniidin on Mangfaii Kaserne. Aiso artici atin are, Jfrom ieft to right,-\ni Engineering}, an?ChiefofStation, Mangfaii\n\n\nThanks to the combined efforts of the Bad Aibling Transition Team, the\nTechnical Support Program Management Of?ce, Eundesnachrichtendienst (END,\nthe German intelligence service and our German partner}, the European Technical\nCenter ITD, NCEUR, and others too numerous to mention, the\nbuilding was completed in just months, from groundbreaking to move-in, all\nduring the depths of winter. END colleagues affectionately refer to the\nnew SUSLAG building as \"Die Elechdose\" or \"the Tin Can,\" owing to its difference\nin appearance from the other buildings on Mangfall Kaserne -- it has no windows, is\nmade of metal and is shelter-like in appearance}. SUSLAG went off NSANET at Ead\nAibling Station on Friday, 3 April EDIE, and reappeared on NSANET in the new\nfacility on the following Monday, thanks to an outstanding team of IT professionals\nworking through the weekend.\n\nIn addition to SUSLAG's long-standing role as liaison to the German\nintelligence service, it is parent to two exciting joint ventures, the Joint\nAnalysis Center and the Joint SIGINT Activity The Joint Analysis\nCenter com rises i'lve NSA civilian anal who are inte ated into the\n\n \n\nJSA, the JAC's younger sibling, was declared operational last year and\ncontinues to build toward full operating capability, which is expected by the end of\nEDGE. The JSA is the outcome of an agreement between the Director, NSA, and the\nPresident of the END to launch a strategic cooperation initiative in the mutual\npursuit of intelligence related to counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and other\ntransnational targets.\n\nWith the establishment of a US-only communications center in the new\nSUSLAG facility, it became possible to provide secure connectivity forJSA, piggy-\nbacking on SUSLAG's connection to ETC, at which point the JSA comms pass\nthrough ETC's Third-Party guard device onto NSANET. This provided for\nthe ?rst time an electronic connection from NSA to JSA for tasking to flow in one\ndirection, and SIGINT in the other. JSA is primarily a SIGDEV asset from NSA's\npoint ofview, but is an essential component of END's collection architecture. JSA is\n\nEofd\n\nunique as ajointly manned, jointly tasked DNI site.\n\nFollowing DIENSA's dictum that making our foreign partners more capable\nalso makes NSA more capable, NSA personnel assigned to JSA are teaching their\nEND counterparts new tools and techniques in advanced signals and protocol\nanalysis and DNI exploitation. Eut this is far more than an academic exercise --\ntraining is being conducted in the course of executing tasked mission, currently\none NSA and two END tasks. END senior leadership recently commended JSA for\ntheir efforts, particularly the contribution that JSA's Afghan task has made\nto one of END's highest priority task, Force Protection in Afghanistan. FCIENSAT\nMission Management has assigned primary responsibility to JSA for 1D beams\non seven satellites, and JSA is continually surveying these beams and feeding the\nresulting metadata to NSA systems.\n\nSUSLAG continues in its traditional role as SIGINT liaison to the\nFederal Republic of Germany. This role has been greatly facilitated by SUSLAG's\nnew location on Mangfall Kaserne. NSA personnel interact daily with END\ncounterparts, coordinating policy, conducting technical exchanges, expanding the\nrange of'cooperation in SIGINT, and deepening the partnership in many ways. The\navailability secure VTC facility on Mangfall Kaserne allows for a close\nand continuing exchange with our partner based on an unprecedented series of\nVTCs. Additionally, visiting NSA technical experts have immediate access to END\ncounterparts, providing for an unmatched exchange of expertise.\n\nSUSLAG is now established on a solid foundation for years to come. In the\npast year, DIENSA, SID's Deputy Director, and the Principal Director of Foreign\nAffairs have visited to add emphasis to their charge to Chief, SUSLAG to broaden\nand deepen the SIGINT relationship with the German partner, moving in new and\nexciting directions. These efforts have already begun to bear fruit, and the future of\nthis productive partnership seems assured.\n\n \n\nNotes:\n\nITD Information Technology Directorate\n\nNCEUR Europe\n\nIISEL Installations Logistics\n\nGSM a type of digital cellular comms [Global System for Mobile\nCommunications}\n\nThis article is reprinted from May's Foreign Affairs Digest\n\nSofa\n\nLlof?\n\n"

IPP and GTE forjoint mission\nbene?t. It builds upon the kev success of the TINT experiment and will provide a vital unigue\n\nlof'j\n\ncapability to MISDIMCE communities-\n\nI TEMFCRA is the codeword for internet buffer business capability as a whole which\nis the ability to loosely promote a We oftraffic across SSE access into a repository\nwhich will keep the content (and its associated metadata} for periods oftime (approximately\n3 days for content and up to 30 days for metadata} to allow retrospective analysis and\nforwarding to follow on systems-\n\n. TEMFCRA as a capability is agnostic of the technologies used to promote that traffic and to\nstore that traffic and so should not be used as a codeword for the individual components (e-g\nKKS- MVR etc}-\n\nI At the moment the components include. amongst others. CCI-ICI SSE Access. FCKERFACE\nsanitisation- RES (in various con?gurations} and it will include MEIR in the very near future-\n\nI TEMFCRA also covers the management ofthe rules used to promote traffic into the internet\nbuffer capability-\n\nI TEMFCRA is not processing centre speci?c- At the moment there are instances of\nTEMFCRA at all (Namely CFC.

The aim is to put the best 15% of\nour access into comprising a mix of Deep Dive Keyscores and promotion of data\nbased on IF subnet or technology type from across the entire MEIR- At the moment. users are\nable to access d?xl?Cs of data via existing Internet Buffers- This is a lot of data! Not only that.\nbut the long?running TINT program and our initial 3?month operational trial ofthe CFC Internet\nBuffer (the ?rst operational Internet Buffer to be deployed} showthat every area of ops can get\nreal bene?t ?\"om this capability. especially for target discovery and target development- Internet\nBuffers are different ?\"om TINT in that the latter is purely an experimental. research environment\nwhereas Internet Buffers can be used operationally for EFF.

We like to let people know when we have something that we can think we can use,\n\nbut we also don?t want to oversell our capability.\n\nFor this reason, each tool indicates its current status. We may put up experimental tools or ones that are still in development so you know what we are\nworking on, and can approach JTRIG with any new ideas. But experimental tools by their nature will be unreliable, if you raise expectations or make\nexternal commitments before speaking to us you will probably end up looking stupid.\n\nMost of our tools are fully operational, tested and reliable. We will indicate when this is the case; however there can be reasons why our tools won?t work\nfor some operational requirements (eg if it exploits a provider specific vulnerability). There may also be legal restrictions.\n\n80 please come and speak to JTRIG operational staff early in your operational planning process.\n\n[edit] Current Priorities\n\nCapability Development Priorities can be fond by following the link below\n\nI CapDev Priorities (Discover)?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n[edit] Engineering\n\n\n\nCerberus\nStatistics\nCollection\n\nJTRIG\nRADIANT\nSPLENDOUR\n\nALLIUM ARCH\n\nASTRAL\nPROJECTION\n\nTWILIGHT\nARROW\n\nSPICE ISLAND\n\nPOISON\nARROW\n\nFRUIT BOWL\n\nNUT ALLERGY\n\nBERRY\nTWISTER\n\nBERRY\n\n\nBRANDY SNAP\nWIND FARM\n\nCERBERUS\nBOMBAYROLL\nJAZZ FUSION\n\nCOUNTRY FILE\n\nTECHNO\nVIKING\n\nJAZZ \n\nBUMBLEBEE\nDANCE\n\nAIR BAG\nEXPOW\n\nAXLE GREASE\nPOD RACE\n\nWATCHTOWER GCNET CERBERUS Export Gateway Interface System\nCERBERUS GCNET Import Gateway Interface System\nExternal Internet Redial and Monitor Daemon\n\nREAPER\n\n\nFOREST\nWARRIOR\n\nDOG HANDLER\n\nDIRTY DEVIL\n\nDescription\n\nCollects on-going usage information about how many users utilise\nUIA capability, what sites are the most frequently visited etc.\nThis is in order to provide JTRIG infrastucture and ITServices\nmanagement information statistics.\n\nis a 'Data Diode' connecting the CERBERUS network with GCNET\n\nJTRIG UIA via the Tor network.\n\nRemote GSM secure covert internet proxy using TOR hidden services.\n\nRemote GSM secure covert internet proxy using VPN services.\n\nnew Infrastructure.

    "doc_text": " Dragnns, Shrimp, and KKEYSEDRE: Tales the Land nf\n\nG?nun\n\n\nEnrnpean Center, SIGDEV \nRun Date: D4f13f2D12\n\n \n\nThe European Center sits \n\nquietly nestled vineyards and farmlands nn EEC\n\ninf-4\n\nthe outskirts of Darmstadt, Germany. To the passing ECC\nmotorist, the facility looks like many ofthe other\nrandom U.S. government facilities in the area, with\none exception. Cine can almost hear a discernable\nbuzz of activity from the of the ECC\nexecuting queries, authoring ?ngerprints, and\nconsuming metadata garnered from In the past three months,\nthe ECC has tripled, and even quadrupled in some cases, the number of queries\nperformed, the number of items pushed tn PINWALE, and the number of sessions\nviewed. And these numbers continue tn grow.?f\n\n \n\nWhat has been the cause ofthis flurry of success? The ECC points tn a\nrecent IKE training blitz in support of the Analytic Modernization ?ntr'eaoh\nCampaign to encourage discover}; In early March, ECC held\nan KRIS Circuit Training event designed to expose to five, Ell-minute\none-on-one sessions in a circuit-type environment. This \"speed dating\" for KRIS\nconsisted of five stations covering topics titled \"Intro to the GUI and Basic\nQueries,\" \"Metadata Setup and Manipulation,\" \"Content and Manipulation of\nResults,\" \"Introduction to Fingerprints,\" and \"Introduction to Microplugins.\"\n\nDyer four days, 63 students were walked through these topics with five\ndifferent instructors, able to ask specific questions and get more comfortable with\nthe tool. \"Everyone likes a new toy, and there was a lot of excitement about it. The\nwill at least try it against their target and see what they will get out of it,\" said\n_one of the instructors and a Analyst embedded in Africa\nDivision.\n\nWith traditional targeting, cast their nets wide into the murky\nwaters of network traf?c and haul in anything that gets caught in the net. We are\nlike Forrest Cump on his shrimping boat off the coast ofAlabama pulling in a boot,\ntoilet seat, seaweed, and there they three shrimp! We burn up a lot of\nresources getting those shrimp, those reportable documents or metadata used to\nexpand target knowledge, and we deal with tons oftoilet seats, the spam and other\njunk. Then, we repeat the same process and hopefully catch enough \"shrimp\" to\nhave ourselves a little cocktail. KRIS has become so important because with it,\ncan downsize their gigantic shrimping nets to tiny, handheld goldfish-sized\nnets and merely dip them into the oceans of data, working smarter and scooping\nout exactly what they want.\n\nAnd a short, two-hour class is an easy gamble of time for the hopes of\nbeing able to work smarter and more ef?ciently. ECC have been trading in\ntheir old nets for new ones and are thrilled with their catches. Discovery can only\noccur ifpeople are willing to try new things, and more of our are getting\ncomfortable with leaping into the relatively unknown world of HRS.\n\n\"The first time I saw KRIS, I said, 'Whoa!!' It is intimidating because you\nopen it up and you see all these queries and fields,\" said_ \"We took the\nstudents from that response to being able to approach it and navigate around in it.\nThey see it differently now and know it's not a seven-headed dragon.\" This gentle\nintroduction has definitely enabled to ease into KRIS and get more\ncomfortable, and with that it has radically changed the overall mentality towards\n\ninf-s\n\nthe tool.\n\nAcross the ECC, wholeheartedly agree that the Circuit\nTraining setup and content was a catalyst to give IKE a try or take existing\nusers to the next level. The one-on-one setup provided a heavy injection oftool\nknowledge into each student. \"Before the training, I was just happy jail,\" said a Circuit Training student and Arabichrench\nLanguage Analyst for CT [Counterterrorism}. \"flow I feel comfortable in my ability\njail. I used to always ask someone to look over my query\nbefore I submitted it. blow, my hand doesn't need to be held.\"\n\nThat Circuit Training must be one tough training to pull off, you say? blot\nso, says _who spoke about the \"off-the-shelf\" nature ofthe training. \"The\nframework was already developed by so it was simple for us to read over\ntheir notes, make it applicable to NSA, and conduct the training. We didn't have to\nspend time writing modules.\"\n\nFrom the leadership level's perspective, the time invested sending\nto the class had a tremendous return. Tech Lead for the\nEll-person strong Africa Division, said, \"The brevity of the class made it easy to\nsend our people. blow we know exactly why we want to use it, and we have\ndiscovered new traf?c and documents. Cur have been building hashes for\ndocument tracking and rolling them into fingerprints. We have been getting\ndocuments in KRIS that we were not getting in our PINWALE queries. just today\nfound reportable material from the Tunisian Ministry of Interior that was\nnot from any selectors we were targeting. blow we know what we can do with KRIS\nand exactly why we want to use it -- to make these discoveries.\"\n\nThese discoveries are igniting a trend ofusing HES on a daily basis. \"For\ndaily pulls, go through TransK, PINWALE, and now KRIS to see what's new\n\nfor the \n\nCombine these exciting finds with the introduction of HRS Skilx points,\nand you can see why McDonald's teamed up with Monopoly years ago: people buy\nmore and even super size their orders just to get game pieces. With the brainchild\nofSkilx, where can earn points and unlock achievements for performing\ntasks in KRIS, people are willing to try new things within the tool. think to\nthemselves, \"Using the Pivot Data feature will earn 3D I'm going to try it\nand see what happens.\" Discovery! Points! We have been lured by our geeky desire\nto unlock achievements and earn points, and bragging rights are everything.\n\n\"Definitely a number ofusers have gotten into the Skilx points. We have\nseveral people at level six. They see what they need to do to earn more points and\nstart trying out different things,\" said_ In fact, ECC now have the\nhighest average of Skilx points compared to all ofthe SE product lines and have\nwritten the most fingerprints per-capita! Some people say that the potent\ncombination ofSkilx points, the Circuit Training, and the team of easily-accessible,\non-site instructors is the secret to ECC's successes with KRIS.\n\nMaybe KRIS is a seven-headed dragon as _mentioned. Big and\nscary? Sure. Strong and powerful? Uh yeah. But, the ECC is taming it, and it is ours\n\n?:1an\n\nto do with whatever we like, including catching shrimp.\n\nECC SIGDEV\n\n \n\nHere are charts to illustrate the point:\n\nfloffl\n\n"

Based on provided by ETC to the Provost Marshall,\nETC was permitted to man the Network Communication Center with two critical\nstaffmemhers.\n\nETC and NSAW personnel worked to mitigate the risk by setting up an\nalternate communications facility at Main: Finthen.

The four anomalies were dug up and no\nordnance was found. Three ofthe four holes contained miscellaneous metallic\ndebris and the fourth contained I-heams that supported an underground storage\narea or tunnel in the original WWII facility.

In earlyjanuary I joined a\nSID team on a trip to Germany to gain insight into the operations there and to\n\nlofd\n\nupdate the Europe workforce on Agency; SID and S2 initiatives. Our team\nconsisted of:\n\nSID Chief of Staff;\n\nSID Executive Assistant;\n\nDeputy Technical Director;\n\nDAP Executive Assistant; and\n\n. and Senior Intelligence Authority}.\n\n \n   \n \n\nWe visited elements of the European Command headquarters\nand Europe near Stuttgart; Germany; the European Security\nCenter in Darmstadt; and the European Technical Cen \nWieshaden. [See a W.) Chief; \naccompanied us throughout.\n\nStuttgart: European Conunand HQ and NSAJC SS Europe \n\nWe arrived in Stuttgart on Monday; January To stave off the jet lag;\nwe walked around downtown Stuttgart until meeting up with a group \nfolks for a dinner of good German food.\n\nCm Tuesday morning we were treated to several on EUCCM and\nNCEUR and met with the EUCCM 13 [Director of Operations}; Rear\nAdmiralmnd EUCCM 12 [Director ofIntelligence}; Brigadier General\n\ncoming away with a better understanding of their perspectives. We used the\nopportunity to explain to them how NSA's distributed analytic enterprise can he\nengaged in efforts to meet their information needs.\n\nCur session with the 3 was very positive and he appreciated the value\n\nofanalysis. Rear Admiral?feels strongly that intelligence sharing needs a\nsystematic approach to enable transparency. He recognizes that we are integrated\nand connected and therefore can't afford to operate independently.\n\nWe next met with the 12. so -The ch {sucom's Joint Analysis\nCenter in Molesworth; England} joined us virtually; giving us the chance to hear\ntheir concerns. We discussed the Mission Build-out; governance; resource\nchallenges and mission management of a distributed enterprise. A key area of\nconcern is \"less commonly taught languages\" and what we're doing to meet that\nchallenge. We made sure they knew that is at the forefront by leveraging\nlanguage resources in Utah [see a related message}. the National Virtual\nTranslation Center and our 2nd party partners. We intend to leverage\nthose opportunities enterprise-wide. We also discussed the new \"lane structure\"\nand the Strategic Mission List. EG -is interested in results from an all-source\nperspective and asked that we keep our capabilities relevant to EUCCM. He was\nglad we were there and hoped we would gain an appreciation of their ops during\nthe rest of our visit.\n\nWe also held a town meeting with NCEUR personnel to cover current\nevents relating to resources and the structure of the Agency; as well as strategic\nplanning initiatives. Major points included:\n\nI Future trends and challenges in A St \nI- Future roles for the extended enterprise in A St \n\nLlan\n\nI Changes in IT infrastructure due to new tools and techniques\nI- SE Assessment Cell\n1' Senior Intelligence Authority issues\n\nWe need to ensure we take advantage oftheir forward presence. As a\nforward-deployed function they are empowered leaders and strategists. We need to\nkeep doing forward what's hest done forward! Following a husy and productive day;\nwe went to a great little restaurant \"Waldheim\" - or \"home in the woods.\"\nPatch Barracks; near Stuttgart: home to EUCDM HQ and NCEUR.\nDannstadt: The European Security Center \nCm the morning of Wednesday; 11 january; we traveled to Darmstadt\nvisit with the 66th MI Group 'ty Center. CCL\n66th MI GP Commander; LTC ESC Director-\nESC Deputy Director; and their energetic team provided an outstanding\n\noverview oftheir organizational structure; operations; successes and challenges.\n\n   \n \n\n  \n\nThe is a functioning part ofthe enterprise. They've made great\nstrides in their analytic expertise. The analytic support received from SIDESEISSG\nis great and continues to expand. S2 elements; in particular and g:\nwere lauded for their outstanding support. The as an AtStP-forward function\ngives them many advantages. Their state-of-the-art operations area allows them\nquick; deployahle; and operational partnerships. Weekly VTCs with virtual teams\nfor targets relevant to the EUCCM theater help them maintain perspective.\n\nWieshaden: The European Tachnic a] Center \n\nWe drove on to Wieshaden that evening. We met up with folks from the\nETC for dinner [at a great restaurant - The Winkger (yes; the Vikingerll to get to\nknow a hit about each other and to help set the stage for Thursday's visit. Through\na series we gained a good perspective on the critical role ETC plays in\nthe enterprise and gained an appreciation ofhow we can work together to heneflt\nthe enterprise. We also held a town meeting with the ETC team where I reiterated\nwhat a greatjoh they are doing with customers; partners; and Third Party\nrelationships.\n\nImpressions \n\nThroughout the visit; the knowledge and insights our personnel gain by\nheing \"forward\" in the customer's domain was evident. Even more impressive was\nhow their knowledge of other operations centers; such as NSA Hi}, the \nCenters; mission ground stations -just to name a few - was heing leveraged to\nrespond to the needs of the EUCCM customer. By knowing how the \nsystem operates; and knowing how to insert requirements; our personnel are ahle\nto make signi?cant contrihutions to the enterprise. In addition; they\ngrow professionally and personally - by seeing our Agency from a different\nperspective; gaining a hroader understanding ofhow we're viewed; and by\nexperiencing life in a different culture.\n\nFor more details about MCEDR type \"go nceur\" on your weh hrowser!\n\nSofa\n\n4of4\n\n"

    "doc_text": " Starting Up a New Mission at the European Security\nOperations Center: End-to-End SIGINT\n\n\n\nIntelligence Analysis Intern\nRun Date: IEIDEIEDDT\n\nWhen considering possible TDY and deployment locations, many of my\nIntelligence Analysis Development Program colleagues have opted for Iraq,\n\nlofd\n\nAfghanistan, or an site. At least for now, I chose to avoid the heat and sand and\ntook advantage of a different opportunity for my fourth IADP tour. From\nMay-September EDDT, I completed a TDY from Ft. Meade to the European Security\nOperations Center in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\nThe ESDC\n\nESDG, which stood up in April EDEN-I [see some baclroround}, is ajoint\nAr'myi'NSA SIGINT operations center and serves as the SEIAnalysis 8: Production\narm Europe ESDG's personnel mi): consists of 1D5th MI\nBattalion soldiers, a small Marine detachment, contractors, Department of the\nArmy civilians, and NSA civilians in Darmstadt and Stuttgart in Germany as well as\nin Molesworth, England, and Mons, Belgium. ESDG's missions include African\nRegional Targets, North African and European Counter-Terrorism missions, Force\nProtectioanndications 8: Warning, and theatre \n\n \n\nDuring my tour, I was assigned to the Africa Division and provided\nESDG with target development support for the Gulfof Guinea Hydrocarbon\nSecurity mission, consisting primarily ofNigerian and Angolan targets. My\nparticular focus was to launch the Africa Division's energy security mission\ncovering Angola.\n\nWorking African missions often present unique challenges, and both\nthe Nigerian and Angolan energy sectors were certainly no different. While ESDG\nhad worked the Nigerian energy security mission for over two years, due to\nresource constraints, relatively little development work had been done against the\nAngolan target. The larger Gulf oquinea Hydrocarbon mission consisted of\nseveral a branch manager, and a technical leader, but it was largely up to\nme to do the bottom-up target development work in building the Angola mission.\n\nThe Gul'foquinen and surrounding region\n\nThe task was somewhat daunting. Angola's state-owned oil firm,\nSonangol, is a massive entity with its own airline, logistical service firms, and\nimportantly, its own telecommunications subsidiary. Sonangol partners with several\nmajor Western and Chinese oil companies, and Chinese firms are heavily involved\nin the telecommunications sector. Our collection was minimal, and our day-to-day\nAngola team was essentially one deep: me.\n\nWe compiled a detailed assessment and established good baseline\nknowledge ofour current SIGINT posture in Angola. We reviewed existing SGS\nFirst Instance Reporting, and had several fruitful exchanges with SGS Luanda in\nAngola. We also worked closely both with ESDG's in-house elements and\nthe European Technical Center to begin a target templating process and draft\ncollection requirements. Through collaboration with CIA and EUGGM Africa\nDivision's understanding of our customer and partner requirements improved\nsignificantly.\n\nIn order to gain a SIGINT window into Angola's telecom sector and\nenergy industry, we chose to continue to chip away at Sonangol. Relying on skills\nand contacts acquired in previous IADP tours, I conducted intensive SIGINT\n\ninf-s\n\nresearch on Sonangol seed selectors using chaining, metadata analysis, and\nvisualization tools such as Gmap and Renoir. My target development work spanned\nboth the DNI and DNR realms. We were able to identify and unlock Sonangol target\ndomains, locate and task e-mail selectors in QADEN GE, and identify several new\ntargets in the Angolan oil and telecommunications sectors.\n\nA key part of my tour at ESGG was identifying new potential collection\naccesses. Using open source, MEALE, ELAQKEEARL, NEE, BEAM, and\nSURREY. I successfully located, identified, and submitted several new targets for\nand SGS collection. Partnering with ESGG SGS, and \ncollection staff at Ft. Meade and elsewhere, we were able to draft and submit the\nfirst collection requirement for the Angola energy mission. By the end of my tour\nESGG had seen a significant increase in Angola energy traf?c. We also were able to\nissue the first product of the Angola mission, ajointly issued report between the\nAfrica division and ESGG \n\nMy tour at ESGG was an excellent exercise in end-to-end SIGINT to\ninclude initial research and target development, collection access discovery and\ntasking, and issuing products. My understanding ofthe SIGINT process improved\ngreatly during my time at ESGG. The recent stand-up of the LIE. African Command\nco-located with EUGGM in Stuttgart, Germany is certain to create\neven more opportunities for to support ESGG's missions in a dynamic\nenvironment.\n\n \n\nNotes:\n\nEUGGM JAG the European Gommand Joint Analysis Center\n\n?inf-i\n\nLlof?\n\n"

Cm 5 July EDGE, the\nDirector, NSA approved the Concept\" which transforms the European\nSecurity Center into the European Security ?pemtions Center \nWith this move, NSA will help build up the Center's capabilities to allow it to\nassume even greater responsibilities within the worldwide SICINT Enterprise.\nWhat will change, specifically?\n\nMore Missions\n\nBeginning in through FY13, the ESDC will evolve by expanding or\nadding more missions that will support national, theater and regional intelligence\nneeds. ESDC's new or expanded missions include:\n\nadditional select Counterterrorism targets,\n\nthe African Union,\n\nNigerian Energy Security,\n\ntargets in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, and\n\ncomplementary capabilities in SICINT Development, Ceospatial Analysis and\nTechnical SICINT.\n\nChanges in Manning\n\nthat's not the only change. To ensure manning stability and to foster\ntrue nationalltactical integration, a core civilians and multi-service Service\nElement military personnel? will work side-by-side with the [primarily]\nArmy tactical SICINT personnel who have manned the ESDC since its start-up.\n\npersonnel at work\nBackground: The ESC\n\nThe European Security Center, primarily a theater SICINT Center manned\nby Army Tactical SICINT personnel from the Military Intelligence Battalion\nin Darmstadt, Germany, was created over two years ago. It was the first center to\nuse tactical resources -- augmented by a few NSA civilians -- to work both theater\ninformation needs as well as national missions.\n\nToday, the ESC is highly successful in producing intelligence for both\nnational customers and the European Command. Its national mission focuses on\nselect Counterterrorism targets, select Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa target\nsets, SICINT Development and Ceospatial Analysis missions. Its theater missions\ninclude Force Protection, Global War on Terrorism support, Pan Sahel?, and\ntargets in West Africa.\n\nThe ESC's most recent SICINT accomplishments include providing the\nmajority of reporting and target tracking on the April EDGE coup attempt in Chad;\nproviding linguistic and analytic support during the on-going Israeli-Lebanon crisis;\nand providing analytic and linguistic support which facilitated the arrests of\nterrorist facilitators operating in Italy.\n\nThe Concept\"\n\nLlan\n\nThe decision to move forward with the creation of the ESDC was founded on\nthe site's ability \n\ncontribute to the national mission,\n\nplug into Theater all-source elements,\n\noptimize support to Theater operations,\n\nprovide tactical over-watch [intelligence support to deployed troops}, and\nmaximize Second and Third party partnerships.\n\nUnder DIRNSA guidance, the US Army will retain its role as Executive Agent and\nHost for the new ESDC.\n\nWhen fully realized, the Concept\" will be a model for future\nnationalltactical integration, by providing an in-theater capability to produce\nhigh-impact analysis in support of all levels ofnational, tactical and Theater\ninformation needs.\n\nPDCs:\n\n \n\nThe \n\n \n\nNotes:\n\nThe multi-service SCE military personnel are part of the Consolidated\nProgram also known as Army tactical SICINT personnel\nare known as \n\nThe Pan Sahel Initiative is a State Department-led effort to assist Mali,\nNiger, Chad, and Mauritania in detecting and responding to suspicious movement\nof'people and goods across and within their borders.\n\nSofA\n\nAofA\n\n"

Note that we had wanted to simply include these Opening Remarks\nTalking Points in our Exec Sum for the visit, but DIR Staff told us they needed a\nseparate document for the Opening Remarks and it needed to be in a specific\nformat. That format is below (example provided is from DENUSA last year).\n\nThe Remarks should outline things that have been accomplished since the last\nconference, as well as things we want to get accomplished in this\nconference/the upcoming year. We should also add anything else FAD wants\nDIRNSA to convey.\n\nOnce the Opening Remarks Talking Points are approved by appropriate DP1\nleadership (at least DP1 Office Chief level), the CD0 should provide the Opening\nRemarks in the attached format to the following aliases at least 3 business days\nin advance of the event:\n\nTO: DL DIRSPEAK\n\nCC: DIR Staff, DP1 Office Chief/Deputy\n\nPer guidance from DIR Staff, it is the responsibility of the folks on the\nDIRCOMMS alias to print out the remarks on 5X8 cards and provide to\nthe DIR staff.\n\n(Updated on 3/4/2013)\n\nTOP USA, DNK\n\nTO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\nDENUSA\n6-8 June\n\nTO USA, DNK) Thank the Danes for their\nwonderful hospitality they extended to you and your\ndelegation during your March visit to Copenhagen.\n\nTO USA, DNK) -\n\nTO USA, DNK)\n\n \n\nTO USA, DNK) Emphasize \ncommitment to the special access and assisting DDIS in\nmanaging the access.\n\nRemind the Danes of the long NSA-DDIS partnership\nworking cable access with.\n\nNote that we look forward to new areas of\ncooperation.\n\nTO USA, DNK) Highlight that NSA is willing to\nengage with DDIS on cyber defense.\n\nTO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\nTOP USA, DNK\nWe believe that furthering our cooperation will be\nmutually beneficial to our two nations.\n\nTO USA, \n\nTO USA, DNK) Stress that Denmark is a very\ntrusted, capable party.\n\n \n \n\nWe value that partnership and we are pleased to be\nmoving forward with DDIS on critical target areas.\n\nWe believe that furthering our cooperation will be\nmutually beneficial to our two nations.\n\nTOP TO USA, DNK\n3\n\n"

This effort was\ninitiated in partnership with the FBI six months ago to\naddress an unreliable and incomplete Facebook collection\nsystem. HSA is now able to access a broad range of Facebook\ndata via surveillance and search activities. dPIs are\nexcited about receiving many content fields, such as chat.\non a sustained basis that had previously only been\noccasionally available. Some content will be completely new\nincluding subscriber videos. Taken together. the new\nFacebook collection will provide a robust SIGINT\nopportunity against our targets from geolocation based on\ntheir IP addresses and user agent, to collection of all of\ntheir private messages and profile information. Multiple\nelements across NSA partnered to ensure the successful\ndelivery of this data. An NSA representative at FBI\ncoordinated the rapid development of the collection system;\n580?s PRINTAURA team wrote new software and made\nconfiguration changes; CES modified their protocol\nexploitation systems and the Technology Directorate fast-\ntracked upgrades to their data presentation tools so that\nOPIs could view the data properly.\n\n"

The OAKSTAR team, along with\nsupport from NSAT and GNDA, just completed a 12 day SIGINT\nsurvey at site, which identified over 230 new links. During\nthe survey, GNDA worked with the partner to test the output\nof their ACS system.

With the requirement that this be done\nrapidly and within our legal authorities. the BLARNEY team\njumped in to work with organizations and partners both\ninternal and external to NBA.\n\nAs OGC, 5V and the TOPIs aggressively worked\nthrOugh the legal paperwork to expedite four new NSA FISA\ncourt orders for Gabon. Uganda, Nigeria and Bosnia, BLARNEY\nOperations Division personnel were behind the scenes\ngathering data determining what survey information was\navailable or could be obtained via their long standing FBI\ncontacts. As they worked to obtain information on both the\nUN Missions in NY and the Embassies in DC, the target\ndevelopment team greased the skids with appropriate data\nflow personnel and all preparations were made to ensure\ndata could flow to the TOPIs as soon as possible. Several\npersonnel, one from legal team and one from target\ndevelopment team were called in on Saturday 22 May to\nsupport the 24 hour drill legal paperwork exercise doing\ntheir part to ensure the orders were ready for the NSA\nDirector's signature early Monday morning 24 May.\n\nWith OGC and 5V pushing hard to expedite these four\norders, they went from the NSA Director for signature to\nDan for SECDEF signature and then to DOJ for signature by\nthe FISC judge in record time. All four orders were signed\nby the judge on Wednesday 26 May! Once the orders were\nreceived by the BLARNEY legal team. they sprung into action\nparsing these four orders plus another ?normal? renewal in\none day. Parsing five court orders in one day a BLARNEY\nrecord! As the BLARNEY legal team was busily parsing court\norders the BLARNEY access management team was working with\nthe FBI to pass tasking information and coordinate the\nengagement with telecommunications partners.\n\n"

    "doc_text": "(U) DEA - The \"Other\" Warfighter\n\n\n\nDEH Account Manager (5112)\nRun Date: Ddf20f2004\n\n(UHFCIUD) When you think about our top national security threats, chances are that terrorism and\nmilitary conflict come quickly to mind - and for good reason. But how many of us list illegal\nnarcotics among the top threats to our society? CIur national leadership rec ognised the seriousness\nthis problem poses and declared a war on drugs two decades ago. This \"war\" has all the risks,\nexcitement, and dangers of conventional warfare, and the stakes are equally high.\n\nWe are all aware that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is leading our\nnation's counternarcotics (CN) efforts. But many are not aware that from the start NSAhas been at\nthe forefront of Intelligence Com mtmity (IC) support to this seemingly unc onyentional DOD\nmission. The noyel collection and analysis techniques NSr??i deyelop ed and refined against these\ncriminalhard targets have not only resulted in major successes in the war on drugs, they have\nalso pr oyen invaluable to other critical SICINT missions, particularly counterterrorism, sometimes\nblurring the lines between the two missions.\n\n(C) DEA has close relationships with foreign goyernm ent counterparts and yetted foreign parmers.\nThe results of this team approach regularly make the headlines in the form of major drug busts and\narrests. Less known is the critical supporting role that continues to play in key DEA operations\nto disrupt the ?ow of narcotics to our country and thwart other, related crimes. DEA, howeyer,\n\nrecognises the unique access and sole source information NEH provides and coordinates major\ncases with the SEFHCN Product Line.\n\n(C) As a result, both agencies enjoy a vibrant two-way information sharing relationship that\nenhances their common mission. Processes haye been carefully established to exchange lead\n(foreign intelligence) information while protecting equities. The Customer Relationships\nDirectorate (51), the Datar?icquisition Directorate (53), and MRSCIC work with the SEFHCN office\nas an integrated team to realise these mission successes.\n\nCure of those successes: Based on 5C5 (US-QEEL) intercept, S2FHCN issued an CIPS\nIMMEDIATE report on 3D March 2:304 on the exact whereabouts of Colombian narcotics trafficker\nConsalo I-linojosa, an eyasiye and brutal international fugitiye wanted for murder, drug trafficking,\nand money laundering. 52F had the foresight to include a tearline to share the actionable\nintelligence with Panamanian parmers. With a short window for action, nsas\nworked through the Joint Interagency Task Force (JITF) - South to immediately forward the\ninformation to DEr??UPanam a. DEr-?UPanama in alerted the Panamanian authorities who quickly\nlocated and apprehended Hinojos a, without knowing the information came from NBA SICINT. r-?Ls\n\nChief note d, this is an esc ellent estam ple of outcom e- oriente collab or ation. \n\n  \n\nTo learn more about NBA support to the \"other\" warfighter, DEA, visit the International\nCrime and Narcotics (52F) website.\n\nSIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside without\nthe consent of SD121 (DL \n\nInformation Dual 012 1,\nPage Publisher: SD121,\nLast Modified: 11IDSI2012 Last\nReviewed: \n\n   \n \n\n   \n \n\n(e mail]\n(email)\n\nDYNAMIC PACE HICI-IEST CLASSIFICATION IS TOP SECRET If SI TK ff REL\nTD USA AUS CAN CER NZL DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED JAN \nCIIN: EDSEDIUS\n\n"

    "doc_text": " \n\nmmpmer Center Intro: Here in 52F, we've had great success\n\nusing systems that buffer full-take audio collection for a\n\nI- nominal 3U days -- these systems have led to real\nbreakthroughs in target discovery -- and we wanted to alert\nether to their potential. Collectors: please take note\nofhow beneficial these types of collectors can be to\nas compared to more traditional models.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSDMALGET is a family of collection systems which greatly facilitate and\nmake possible remarkable new ways of performing both target development1 and target\n\ndiscovery.2 Signi?cant analytic breakthroughs and successes in both areas have been\nmade STD in the two cotmtries where SDMALGET accesses currently exist\nand the Bahamas).\n\n(U) How It Works:\n\nSDMALGET collection systems forwardI full?take rnetadata in real time\n\nand buffer full?take audio for nominally 30 days.3 It makES the 5919mm\" ?f\naudio content against the buffered data after the fact, in near real-time, or up to 3D days\nlater. This ability is dubbed \"retrospective retrieval.\" The power of retrospective\nretrieval in facilitating target development or discovery lies in its ability to permit the\nanalyst to selectively ren'ieve audio content and immediately validate hisfher tentative\nanalytic conclusions derived from metadata.\n\n0 (TSHSIHREL) SOMALGET access to Bahamian GEM commtmications has led to\nthe discovery of international narcotics traf?ckers and special?interest alien\nsmugglers. This access -- together with DUI use of methods that take advantage of\n\ntargets' behavioral patterns4 -- have allowed our 52F to gain a firm\ntuiderstanding of the targets' activities even when these contacts occtu'red prior to\ntheir discovery.\n\n(U) More to Come?\n\nThese successes, which depend on access to buffered audio files that may\nbe associated with selectors not tasked to the collection asset in question, argue in\nfavor of a collection methodology for telephony tirat may be viewed as analogous to\nXKE That is, we buffer certain calls tirat .MAY be of foreign intelligence\nvalue for a suf?cient period to per?rui a well?informed decision on wiretirer to\nretrieve and return speci?c audio content. i-?Jith proper engineering and coordination,\nthere is little reason this capability cainiot expand to other accesses (besides\n\n_and the Bahamas), provided compatible hardware and interfaces are\ndeveloped and deployed.5\n\n(U) Notes:\n\n1. (U) Target development the process by which an analyst can extend hist'her\nknowledge of a known target by observing elements of metadata that relate to that\ntarget.\n\n2. (U) Target discovery the process whereby an analyst can discover targets by\nobserving metadata as it relates to behaviors characteristic of lliSfllEl? target set,\nregardless of whether or not the newly discovered selectors are related to laiown\ntargets.\n\n3. The nominal days storage\" actually varies depending upon on\nspace, power, and observed activity levels.\n\n4. Observing that targets tend to use prepaid calling cards in an attempt\nto mask the destination of telephone calls, SZF focused on mobile identifiers in number\nranges that represent newly activated accotmts. We have also used SMS text messages\nto identify and renieve audio of interest.\n\n5. Storage capacity is directly related to the amotuit of disk storage that\ncan be deployed. ?When deployed against entire networks, as SDMALGET is, the back-\nend database and processing required for interactive search and retrieval of cuts also\nrequires enterprise-class data warehousing and high-performance processing to manage\nthe vast amotuit of data caputred. Currently this warehouse dynamically manages\nroughly 5 billion call events, with the capacity to expand well beyond our current target\ncommtmications. This retrospective retrieval infrastructure is web based and is already\nin place. As noted, with proper engineering and coordination, there is little reason this\ncapability cainiot expand to other accesses, provided compatible hardware and\ninterfaces are developed and deployed.\n\n"

PRINTAURA volunteered to gather\nthe detailed data related to each selector from multiple\nlocations and assemble it in a usable form. In the second\nproject, the PRISM Mission Program Manager (MPH) recently\nbegan sending operational PRISM news and guidance to the\nFBI and CIA so that their could task the PRISM\nsystem properly. be aware of outages and changes. and\noptimize their use of PRISM.

Until now, PRISM\nwould not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other\nthan the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action\nwill mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any\ne?mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow\nto task these non?Microsoft e?mail addresses to PRISM, however,\nSSO intends to fix that this summer. In the meantime, NSA, FBI and Dept\\of\nJustice coordinated over the last six months to gain approval for PRINTAURA\nto send all current and future Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype. This\nresulted in about 9800 selectors being sent to Skype and successful\ncollection has been received which otherwise would have been missed.\n\n"

Skype stored communications will contain unique data which\nis not collected via normal real?time surveillance collection. SSO expects\nto receive buddy lists, credit card info, call data records, user account\ninfo, and other material. On 29 March 2613, SS6 forwarded approximately 2666\nSkype selectors for stored communications to be adjudicated in SV41 and the\nElectronic Communications Surveillance Unit (ECSU) at FBI. SV41 had been\nworking on adjudication for the highest priority selectors ahead of time and\nhad about 166 ready for ECSU to evaluate. It could take several weeks for\nSV41 to work through all 2666 selectors to get them approved, and ECSU will\nlikely take longer to grant the approvals. As of 2 April, ESCU had approved\nover 36 selectors to be sent to Skype for collection. PRISM Skype collection\nhas carved out a vital niche in NSA reporting in less than two years with\nterrorism, Syrian opposition and regime, and exec/special series reports\nbeing the top topics. Over 2866 reports have been issued since April 2611\nbased on PRISM Skype collection, with 76% of them being single source.\n\n"

We can't simulate the bug in our lab and so it's\nimpossible to predict exactly what will happen when we apply the software\nupdate. We propose to update one of the nodes in NBP-320 ?rst to determine\nifthe update goes smoothly.\n\nRecently we tried to reset the standby manager card in the HOMEMAKER\nnode. When that failed, we attempted to physically reseat it. Since it was the\nstandby card, we did not expect that would cause any problems. However,\nupon reseating the card, the entire ONS crashed and we lost all traffic through\nthe box. It took more than an hour to recover from this failure.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that we have to blow away the entire con?guration\nand start from scratch. Prior to starting our upgrade, we will save the\nconfiguration so that if we have to configure the box from scratch, we can\nsimply uploade the saved configuration. We estimate that we will be down for\nno more than an hour for each node in the system.\n\n3/26/2013 8:16:13 AM\n\nWe have tested the upgrade in our lab and it works well.

Here?s how it works: shipments of computer network \ndevices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are\nintercepted. Next, they are redirected to a secret location where Tailored Access\nOperations/Access Operations (AO S326) employees, with the support of the Remote\nOperations Center (S321), enable the installation of beacon implants directly into our\ntargets? electronic devices. These devices are then re-packaged and placed back into\ntransit to the original destination. All of this happens with the support of Intelligence\nCommunity partners and the technical wizards in TAO.\n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSuch operations involving supply-chain interdiction are some of the most\nproductive operations in TAO, because they pre-position access points into hard target\nnetworks around the world.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nF) Left: Intercepted packages are opened carefully; Right: A ?load station?\nimplants a beacon\n\nIn one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supply-\nchain interdiction called back to the NSA covert infrastructure. This call back provided\nus access to further exploit the device and survey the network. Upon initiating the survey,\nSIGINT from TAO/Requirements Targeting determined that the implanted\ndevice was providing even greater accesses than we had hoped: We knew the devices\nwere bound for the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) to be used as part of\ntheir internet backbone, but what we did not know was that GSM (cellular)\n\nDerived From: 1?52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20350501\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nnetwork was also using this backbone. Since the STE GSM network had never before\nbeen exploited, this new access represented a real coup.\n\nTAO is now able to automatically exfiltrate call detail records (CDRs)\ncontaining billing information from STE, showing subscribers? interlocutors and their\ngeographic locations. This access has, in turn, enabled access to CDRs from other GSM\nnetworks in the region, including GPRS data as well as the exploitation of a GSM switch\nthat provides target voice content exfiltration. A very successful operation!\n\nWant to know more about Type ?go in your browser.\n\nPOC: \n\nTOP \n\n"

Though it took five years to get to\nthe one trillion mark, almost half of this volume was processed in this\ncalendar year, and half of that volume was from DANCINGOASIS.\nSHELLTRUMPET is currently processing Two Billion call events/day from\nselect SSO (Ram?M, OAKSTAR, MYSTIC and NCSC enabled systems), MUSKETEER,\nand Second Party systems. We will be expanding its reach into other 550\nsystems over the course of 2013. The Trillion records processed have\nresulted in over 35 Million tips to TRAFFICTHIEF.\n\n"

Cusick, Director Foreign Affairs (DIRFA)\n\nBACKGROUND: As General Alexander?s UK counterpart, Sir Iain has visited\nNSA on several occasions as one would expect, both in his current position and previous ones.\nSir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air Chief Marshal\nSir Stuart Peach. That visit had a more de?ned purpose of introducing Sir Stuart to\nUSCYBERCOM and NSA leadership as the Commander of the newly-established Joint\nForces Command. This will be the ?rst visit in some time that will allow the visitor to reconnect\nwith NSA Leadership on matters.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE VISIT: As the Director of GCHQ, Sir Iain wants to reconnect\nwith NSA Leadership on matters of mutual concern, and to ensure each partner is aware of the\nother?s activities and future plans.\n\nGUIDANCE: (U) \n\nPREP SESSION GUIDANCE: NONE\nREQUESTED: NONE\nCYBERCOM REQUESTED: NONE\n\nKEY TOPIC AREAS:\n\nFAD and SUSLOL are not aware of any particular issues that Sir Iain will want to\naddress. NSA leadership should still be aware of the following topics that may pertain to their\norganizations or areas of responsibility, as the potential exists for them to be brought up by the\nv1s1t0r:\n\n- FAA 702 Data: Unsupervised access to FAA 702 data, in a manner similar\nto Olympics Option, remains on wish list and is something its leadership still\ndesires. NSA and SID leadership are well aware of request for this data, and the\nsteps necessary for approval. NSA leadership could be asked whether we?re still\nsupportive of this initiative. On a related topic, progress continues on ?Triage \nGCHQ access to FAA 702 data under supervised conditions. The MOA is now back in\n\nDerived From: 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRETHSI NOFORN\n\nNOFORN\n\ncourt awaiting signature. With that said, GCHQ seems less enthused about\nTriage, perhaps in part because of the long steps necessary to gain approval. For\nadditional background about these topics, see the attached paper that Mr.\n\nSID Associate Deputy Director, Counterterrorism\nT) SIGINTAuthorities Lead, Counterterrorism Mission Management\nCenter prepared for ?s April 2013 UK visit.\n\n- UK Intelligence Community Oversight: GCHQ and its sister intelligence\nagencies are challenged with their activities and operations being subject to increased\nscrutiny and oversight from their government (and public). As a result, closer attention is\nbeing paid to how UK?produced intelligence data is being used by NSA, and other\npartners. It is possible that Sir Iain may ask about what safeguards NSA may be putting\nin place to prevent UK data from being provided to others, the Israelis for instance, who\nmight use that intelligence to conduct lethal operations. For additional information about\nthis subject, and other UK Intelligence Community legal issues and legislation, see the\nattached paper prepared by Mr. O??ice of the General Council, London.\n\n- Syria: Prime Minister Cameron continues to look to the UK security and\nintelligence agencies for recommended courses of action to in?uence the outcome in\nSyria, but to this point GCHQ has not offered much beyond messaging and limited online\neffects operations. ability to contribute signi?cantly to the overall Syria SIGINT\neffort is hampered by limited resources. It should be noted that the UK\nIntelligence Community is just as concerned about the end state of Syria?s chemical and\nbiological weapons as the US. Intelligence Community. Sir Iain may want to discuss\nSyria?s use of chemical weapons and how the US. Government intends to react. For\nmore information about NSA ?s posture against Syria, see attached Near East Division-\nproduced paper on Syria.\n\n0 TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Points: Syria remains\nlocked in a protracted struggle, with both the opposition and the regime ?rmly\nentrenched in their positions. Attempts to coalesce the opposition have moved\nextremely slowly, while the regime has not in any way indicated that it would\nwillingly stand aside. Given this lack of movement in negotiations and the\nstalemate on the ground, we anticipate the con?ict will not be resolved in an\nexpedient manner.\n\n0 TO USA, FVEY) NSA continues to monitor the situation in\nSyria from all angles, including from the viewpoint of the regional, international,\nand radical actors. NSA remains concerned about chemical weapons security and\ncontinues to monitor the situation closely, to the best of our ability.\n\n- Iran: GCHQ and the UK Government remain concerned about events in\nIran and the possibility that tensions with the West or Israel could escalate. The visitor\nmay ask NSA and SID leadership to share their views on what is going to happen with\n\nDerived From: 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRETHSI NOFORN\n\nNOFORN\n\nIran, to include potential Israeli response. For information about NSA ?s posture against\nIran, see attached Iran Division produced paper on Iran.\n\n0 TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Point: Emphasize that we have\nsuccessfully worked multiple high-priority surges with GCHQ that have allowed\nus to re?ne maintaining mission continuity and seamless transition, and maximize\nour target coverage. These jointly-worked events include the storming of the\nBritish Embassy in Tehran, Iran?s discovery of FLAME, and support to\npolicymakers during the multiple rounds of P5 plus 1 negotiations.\n\nTO USA, GBR) Global Collaboration Environment (GCE): On 2 April\n2013, SID Foreign Partner Strategist (FPS) Mr. held a discussion with\nMr. (Head of Bilateral and Multilateral Relations, GCHQ International\nRelations) to discuss the future of GCE in a post-Afghanistan era. GCE is the next\ngeneration of PARTNERMALL (PMP) and should be the ?lture partner collaboration\nsolution of choice. GCE expands the current single collaboration environment PMP\ncapability into a bilateral and multilateral model. The two discussed the bene?ts of NSA\nand GCHQ having a united front in its dealings with the other foreign partners on this\nissue. They also discussed the possibility of the UK hosting a permanent facility where\nfrom partner nations could be co-located, along with ways to better integrate\nGCE into each partner?s analytic work?ow. For information about this discussion, see\nthe attached paper prepared by SID ?s Foreign Partner Strategist Ojfice.\n\nTO USA, GBR) Director Talking Points: Thank GCHQ for giving full\nsupport to GCE, and for partnering with NSA to engage in \nmessaging to other organizations.\n\n0 TO USA, GBR) Encourage GCHQ to host the permanent facility for the\njoint SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) collaboration center, in order to maximize\nthe bene?t for the Five Eyes partnership.\n\n0 TO USA, GBR) Offer assistance in ?nding good solutions for\nincorporating GCE access into analytic work?ow. Encourage GCHQ to\nengage with TD on this subject.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: See above.\n\nVISIT FORMAT: General Alexander will host a dinner in honor of Sir Iain at his\nresidence on 30 April 2013. The two directors will also have a one-on-one discussion on 1 May\n2013. The remainder of Sir Iain?s agenda will involve NTOC and TAO tours/demos, along with\ndiscussions with NSA Leadership, including Ms. Teresa H. Shea, SIGINT Director, Mrs. Debora\nA. Plunkett, IAD DIR, Mr. Rajesh De, General Council, Mr. Wayne M. Murphy, \n\nAnalysis and Production, Mr. Data Acquisition Mrs. -\n\nThreat Operations Center (NTOC), Mr. Robert E.

Sir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air\nChief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach. During that visit, Sir Iain met with General Alexander,\n\nMr. Inglis, and other NSA and USCYBERCOM leaders.\n\nPOTENTIAL LANDMINES: GCHQ has long advocated that it work with NSA\nand the Israeli SIGINT Service (ISNU) in a trilateral arrangement in prosecuting the Iranian\ntarget. SID policy has been opposed to such a blanket arrangement, and the speci?c trilateral\nexplained in the attached paper on Iran should not be interpreted as a broad change of approach.\nIn other areas, NSA and GCHQ have agreed to continue to share information gleaned from the\nrespective bilateral relationships with ISNU.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION (GOOGLE SEARCH, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS,\nINTERESTING FACTS, (U) NONE\n\nRECENT PRESS INDICATIONS: (U) \n\nDerived From: 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRETHSI NOFORN\n\n"

    "doc_text": " 2009 SIGDEV Conference: 'Best Yet and Continuing to Improve'\n\nFROM: --I\n\nSIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG)\nRun Date: 08/14/2009\n\nSIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (S SG) hosted the annual Five-Eyes event\nfrom 1-5 June, attracting approximately 1372 participants, including 297 travelers to Fort Meade, of\nwhom 100 were Second Party delegates. Eighty-six representatives from the wider US Intelligence\nCommunity, covering agencies as diverse as CIA (a record 50 participants), the Air Force Research\nLaboratory and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center were also in attendance. who\ncould not attend the conference were able to view streamed live presentations.\n\nThis large and diverse audience is drawn together each year in recognition that this key,\nsingle event enables unprecedented visibility of SIGINT Development activities from across the\nExtended Enterprise, Second Party and US Intelligence communities. More importantly, it provides a\nway for these disparate groups to discovery efforts, share breakthroughs, and swap\nknowledge on the art of analysis. The SIGDEV Conference (SDC) engagement continues to enable the\nIntelligence Community to perform mission and achieve results none could achieve on their own.\n\nOver 200 separate briefings, demonstrations, roundtables, workshops and tours were\noffered throughout the week across five threads. Chris Inglis, Deputy Director NSA, delivered the SDC\nintroductory remarks and Bran Ferren (right), Co-Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Applied Minds\nInc., delivered an engaging keynote address on this year's theme, From Ideas to Outcomes.\"\nBoth speakers highlighted the increasing focus of the digital information age and the challenges facing\nSIGINT operating in cyberspace, a likely area of specific focus for neXt year's SDC.\n\nIn particular, Mr Inglis (left) spoke of how the US and its allies face huge challenges with\ncyberspace as \"no domain is so richly populated,\" has more information stored within it, underpins so\nmany other domains, changes as \"rapidly, agilely or fluidly\" or requires the application of diverse skill\nsets. In Mr Inglis's words, \"the need to understand and lay bare cyberspace is the stuff of it\nwill underpin our success in this space.\" The need for the offensive (SIGINT) and defensive\n(Information Assurance) realms to integrate was flagged as critical, with Mr Inglis suggesting that the\nfuture may see the community talk about SIGDEV as development\", given that\n\"increasingly, SIGDEV is the necessary underpinning for the totality of what we do in cyberspace.\"\n\nAssociate Deputy Director for SIGDEV and  Chief\n\nSignals Survey Analysis, presented the annual DILKE-ALLEN Award, Charlie Tevis Community\nService Award and the Gold Pulse Award.*\n\nAs in 2008, we included facilitated sessions in this year's conference and found that they\ncontinue to prove their value by resulting in focused discussions, generating clear actions for post-\nconference efforts. For the first time in SDC history, this year's conference included an entire one-day\nthread focused on the Future Technology Threat, the results of which will help us keep up with ever-\nchanging technology trends. Because of this success, we will continue to offer narrow-focused threads\nin the upcoming conferences.\n\nIn another first for the 2009 conference, the Communications System Analysis thread\nconducted four \"hands-on\" workshops that brought together from various agencies to work\n\nsome of the Extended Enterprise's most challenging problems. In one of the workshops, a facilitated\nsession was dedicated to botnets. This provided an opportunity to demonstrate some of the Agency's\nmost powerful analytic tools and an opportunity for exchange of information among the in\nattendance. The workshop also provided an opportunity to go over all the SIGINT tools and techniques\nthat are used in the identification and processing of this malicious software, generating possible new\nways for identification and exploitation. The workshops provided an excellent opportunity for our\njunior to work side by side with some of the leading experts in this field. Our intentions next\nyear are to push for more of these types of workshops.\n\nThe Five-Eyes SIGDEV Heads received detailed summaries of each thread's outcomes and\nactions during the conference wrap-up session. momentum and activity is being maintained\nby thread leads and analytic tradecraft teams with quarterly updates on SDC efforts and actions to be\nprovided to those Five-Eyes SIGDEV Heads. This increased effort in post-conference engagement is\nseen as a key factor in living up to the SDC 2009 conference theme, whereby Five-Eyes SIGDEV\nelements will work to take SDC 2009 ideas and turn them into SIGINT outcomes.\n\nIf you weren't able to attend, you can still benefit by viewing presentations and sessions at\nthe SDC 2009 webpage (\"go sdc2009\").\n\nAfter-conference surveys were distributed to those who had registered for the conference.\nResults are still coming in and will be posted on the SDC2009 website as soon as possible. Comments\nfrom these surveys are extremely critical as we begin planning for the 7-11 June 2010 conference.\nFurther details regarding 2010 conference themes and key dates will be revealed in the coming months.\n\n(U) Notes:\n\nNominations for the 2010 DILKE-ALLEN Award are now being accepted. Please canvas\nyour organization to identify SIGINT Development activities where two or more Five-Eyes agencies\nhave come together to produce exceptional work that is worthy of the 2010 award. To find out more\nabout the award nomination submission process, and see a list of the 2009 award winners to include the\nwinning submission, visit the award website.\n\n"

This precess. as with any analysis at it's mest fundamental level. is based\nen assumptiens.

New. let's see\nhew these manifest in eur example kenyan cen?g {if yeu're net familiar with reuter cen?gs. den't\nwerry. this will be pretty basic}:\n\n1) First. let's leek at the vty lines en the reuter. and see if there is an access list\nasseciated with them:\n\nline vty 5 \naccess-class 11 in\n\n\n\n'i'up. fer all ef the telnet lines. access list #11 is basically means. if yeu\nwant te telnet te this reuter. yeu have te meet the criteria ef that access list. feh. befere ferget.\npasswerd T's are te crack. reu can geegie 'cisce passwerd cracker' and get web\npages that aiiew yeu te cepy the passwerd hash. and it'I'i break it fer can ?gure\neut the passwerd fer this reuter.

Hewever. if yeu the have the right\npasswerd. yeu'll leg in. yeu can run yeur cemmands te de whatever yeu want te de. and the server\nwill spit back the eutput fer all ef the cemmands that yeu run.\n\nI knew. that seunds uber?simple. but here's why it matters. Think abeut what all ef\nthis weuld leek like if we were te ebserve this in eur passive SISINT system. We weuld prebably see\ntraf?c between twe IFs. ene ef the perts weuld be en pert 22 (we'll say that's the server\nside). The traf?c geing 22 IIin the client-te-server directien) will censist ef sending a\nusername. sending a passwerd. and sending cemmands [assuming the client successfully legged\nin). Fer traf?c ceming 22. depends.\n\nIf the client dees net have the right credentials. we'd expect the server-te-client\ndirectien te censist cf:\n\n1) sending the device's banner\n\n2) sending the prempt fer a username\n\nS) sending the prempt fer a passwerd\n\nA) sending anether prempt fer a passwerd\n\nS) sending ANDTHEF. prempt fer a passwerd\n\nS) subsequently giving up. killing the cennectien. and fercing the client te restart and try again\n\nIf the client does have the right credentials. we might expect the server-te-client\ndirectien te censist cf:\n\n1) sending the device's banner\n\n2) sending the prempt fer a username\n\nS) sending the prempt fer a passwerd\n\nA thru sending back the eutput fer whatever cemmands the client runs\n\nSe. purely based eff efthe abeve assessment. we weuld expect unsuccessful legins\nte be censistently small [as in. the number ef bytes) in the server-te-client directien. Hewever.\nsuccessful legins will be ef variable length. but prebably censistently larger in size {in bytes)\nwhen cempared te unsuccessful legins. Se. ene assumptien that I am suggesting is:\n\n'feu can guesstimate whether an SSH sessien was successful er net based\neff ef the size ef the sessien in the server-te-client directien.\n\nSe. imagine that yeu de seme analysis. and determine that bytes is reughly a\ngeed number te differentiate between successfuliunsuccessful SSH legin attempts. Any server-\nte-client SSH sessien belew that size is prebably an unsuccessful attempt. and any server-\nte-client SSH sessien ever that size is prebably a successful attempt. What ceuld yeu de. armed\nwith infermatien like that?\n\n1) Wu ceuld create lists ef client IF addresses that censistently are unsuccessful in SSH\nsessiens te multiple servers. Then yeu ceuld put these in a. \"prebably passwerd\nguessersiprebably brute fercers\" list.\n\n21'Tbu ceuld alse create lists ef IF addresses that appear te be successful in having access te\nether IFs. yeah. here's where we can have funiI\n\nIISHSIHREL) I'm sure there are a plethera ef ether things yeu can de with that sert ef data. but I'm\nreally interested in #2 at the mement.

    "doc_text": "(U) Tasking of SCALAWAG\n\nTO USA, FVEY) has long since\nreached the point where it was collecting and sending home far more\nthan the bandwidth could handle. Over collecting has significantly\nincreased the latency of pri 1-2 content data. Because SCALAWAG is\nNSA's #1 provider of actionable SIGINT on COUNTRY\nmeasures had to be taken to alleviate pressure on the\nbandwidth and decrease latency of priority 1-2 data. In the summer of\n2011, in an effort decrease the amount of voice content brought home,\n880 deleted a large quantity of priority 4 and below tasking that was\nbringing content and according to the DOUBLEARROW database had\nnot been \"touched\". Additionally, a change of priority 4 tasking to\npriority 6 was effected, again based on DOUBLEARROW results. As a\nresult, the latency for primarily pri 1-2 had dropped considerably.\nHowever, these actions were still falling short because the volume of\ncollection was increasing \n\nTO USA, FVEY) On 15 December 2011, 880 collection\nand program management implemented a rule for SCALAWAG UTT\ntasking, that basically does not allow any \"Effective Collection Priority\"\n(ECP) pri 4 and below tasking. It must be understood that the priority\nof tasking in UTT IS NOT the same and straight forward as OCTAVE.\nmust choose fields whose net result is priority 1-3.\nAdditionally, all UTT ECP pri 4 and below tasking was deleted. Since\nimplementation, some TOPIS may have noted a decrease total volume\nin their SCALAWAG collection delivered to their NUCLEON accounts.\nMany SCALAWAG users are familiar with and have access to the\nRETROSPECTIVE retrieval tool (RETRO TOOL). The RETRO tool is\na unique one-off capability that exists only at SCALAWAG. It allows\nto go nominally 30-days into the past and retrieve audio of\n\ninterest that was not tasked at the time of the original call. Analyst\nretrievals should be based on metadata, SRI found in FASCIA, that'll\nindicate there's a target of interest that's been detected in\nSCALAWAG's environment. Once the audio is identified, retrieved, and\nfonNarded to your NUCLEON account, would then consider\ntasking the number in UTT at ECP 1-3, based on the critical need for\nthe data.\n\nTO USA, FVEY) Retrieval and fonivarding via the RETRO\nTOOL will significantly reduce bandwidth and latency issues. It will also\nlikely result in getting the audio data back to your NUCLEON account\nmore quickly than if tasked at ECP 4 and below. We strongly request\nthat do not artificially inflate the priority of their tasking just to\nget numbers tasked. SlGDEV/Target development should be\naccomplished using the RETRO TOOL and subsequent tasking occur\nbased on should make use of the RETRO TOOL\nwhenever possible to retrieve the desired audio content. We do not\nhave the luxury of task and forget.\n\n"

Here's what told as:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI l. (U) Does NSA establish 3rd Party ties to meet speci?c short-term needs, or do we take a more long-term approach. thinking in\nterms of developing relationships over the course of decades J. even though they may not bearfruitfor some time?\n\nWe establish foreign partnerships to satisfy US. intelligence requirements. For speci?c short-term needs. it may be suf?cient to work through\nCIA Chiefs of Station at those locations where we do not have SIGINT partnerships established. Formal relationships require considerable resources. so\nif we can meet our objectives -- particularly short-term ones working through CIA. that's okay. If . on the other hand. our SIGIN exchanges increase in\nvolume andlor complexity. or if a direct partnership is necessary because of Indications and Warning considerations we need rapid. direct\nexchange of information), then we will establish a formal SIGINT relationship. after DNI approval.\n\n(CHRELI Many of our relationships have. indeed. spanned several decades. allowing us to establish higher degrees of trust with and reliance on one another.\nThis. in turn. has led to greater levels of cooperation, where. for instance. NBA might be willing to share advanced techniques with a proven and reliable\npartner. in return for that partner's willingness to do something politically risky. Trust requires years to build up but it can be lost in a very short period of\ntime.\n\n- 2. (U) What are we q?er, in general? ls it our partners' accesses. or their expertise on a speci?c or is it impossible to generalize, because it\nvaries on a case-breasts basis?\n\nYes. yes yes! Our partners' geography and access to high-priority target communications are a huge plus. as is their expertise on specific\ntargets. With rare exception. they know their regional 'hoods better than we do and they exponentially add to our foreign language capability.\n\n- 3. (U) Are ourforeign intelligence relationships usually msuiatedfmm short-term political ups and downs, or not?\n\nFor a variety of reasons. our intelligence relationships are rarely disrupted by foreign political perturbations. international or domestic- First. we\nare helping our partners address critical intelligence shortfalls. just as they are assisting us. Second. in many of our foreign partners? capitals. few senior\nof?cials outside of their defense-intelligence apparatuses are wilting to any SIGIN connection to the U.SJNSA.\n\nThere are exceptions. both on the positive and negative sides. For instance. since the election of a pro?American president. one European partner\nhas been much more open to providing information on their own capabilities and techniques. in hope of raising our intelligence collaboration to a higher level.\nConvenely. another of our partnerships has stalled. due largely to that country's regional objectives not being in with those of the U5.\n\n9 4. (U) What do Third Parties typically as? What do dig get out of tire relationship?\n\nGenerally speaking. our Third Party partners want access to our technology, as well as our regionallglobal reach.

Some of the data in the databases is NSA FlSA-derived or FBI CT\nFISA~derived While not every database contains FISA-derived material, it is reasonable to expect\nthat at the CCs will perform mission with agility, moving across targets and databases as\nmission demands, and that sometimes that will mean accessing data Within a database that does\ncontain FISA?derived data. Access to these databases is restricted to who hold the\nRAGTIME ECI, have a specific ?need to know? about the data stored Within the databases, and who\nare authorized by the data owner. For some years CES has been the recipient of improperly\nmarked/classi?ed data but all have been and are aware that data marked with the SIGAD\nU8984J and case notation is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD\nis NSA FISA data. CES believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the\nclassification of the data before it is fed into our systems. This is an ongoing issue which should not\nimpede the approval of this SPF but the matter should be addressed. CES will ensure that all\naccessing these databases know that data marked with the SIGAD U3984J and case\nnotation is FBI data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD is NSA\nFISA data, and that this data should be classi?ed TOP - ECI \n\nOFORN . Ideally all FISA and material should be held separately, and FBI and NSA\nFISA should be partitioned by individual target.

(U) INTRODUCTION\n\n \n\n(U) This Report\n\nOn 4 October 2001, President George W. Bush issued a\nmemorandum entitled FOR SPECIFIED\nELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES DURING A LIMITED\nPERIOD TO DETECT AND PREVENT ACTS OF TERRORISM\nWITHIN THE UNITED The memorandum was based on the\nPresident?s determination that after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks\nin the United States, an extraordinary emergency existed for national\ndefense purposes.\n\nThe 4 October 2001 Presidential authorization delegated\nauthority to the Secretary of Defense, who further delegated it to the\nDirector of National Securitv Agencv/Chief. Central Securitv Service\nto conduct speci?ed electronic surveillance on targets\nrelated to Afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days. Because the\nsurveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of\nthe United States, it would otherwise have required FISC authority.\n\nThe Authorization specified that NSA could acquire the\ncontent and associated metadata of telephony and Internet communications\nfor which there was probable cause to believe that one of the\ncommunicants was in Afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged\nin or preparing for acts of international terrorism. In addition, NSA was\nauthorized to acquire telephony and Internet metadata1 for communications\nwith at least one communicant outside the United States or for which no\ncommunicant was known to be a citizen of the United States. NSA was\nalso allowed to retain, process, analyze and disseminate intelligence from\nthe communications acquired under the authority. 2\n\n \n\nThis report provides the classi?ed results of the NSA Office of\nthe Inspector General (OIG) review of the President?s Surveillance\nProgram (PSP) as mandated in the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) of 2008.\nIt includes the facts necessary to describe from perspective:\n\n \n\n1 (U)Metadata is data that describes content, events, or networks associated with SIGINT targets.\n2 (U)The Authority changed over time.

As mandated by the FAA, this review includes activities\nauthorized by the President between 11 September 2001 and 17 January\n2007 and those activities continued under FISC authority. This includes\nthe program described by the President in a\n\n17 December 2005 radio address as the Terrorist Surveillance Program,\nwhich was content collected under the Authorization.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nII. REVIEW CATEGORIES\n\n(U) ONE: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUTHORITY\n\nU0) Immediately after the attacks of I 1 September 200], NSA considered\nhow to work within existing SIGINT authorities to counter the terrorist threat\nwithin the United States and adjusted SIGINT processes accordingly. Shortly\ntherea??er, in response to a White House request, the Director of NSA identified\nSIGINT collection gaps. The Counsel to the Vice President used this information\nto draft the Presidential authorization that established the PSP.\n\n(U) Actions Taken After 9/11\n\n \n\nOn 14 September 2001, three days after terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States, General Hayden approved the targeting of terrorist?\nassociated foreign telephone numbers on communication links between the\nUnited States and foreign countries where terrorists were known to be\noperating. Only speci?ed, pre-approved numbers were allowed to be\ntasked for collection against U.S.?originating links. He authorized this\ncollection at Special Collection Service and Foreign Satellite sites with\naccess to links between the United States and countries of interest,\nincluding Afghanistan. According to the Deputy General Counsel, General\nHayden determined by 26 September that any Afghan telephone number in\ncontact with a US. telephone number on or after 26 September was\npresumed to be of foreign intelligence value and could be disseminated to\nthe FBI.\n\nNSA OGC said General Hayden?s action was a law?il\nexercise of his power under Executive Order (E.O.) 12333, United States\nIntelligence Activities, as amended. The targeting of communication links\nwith one end in the United States was a more aggressive use of ED. 12333\nauthority than that exercised by former Directors. General Hayden was\noperating in a unique environment in which it was a widely held belief that\nadditional terrorist attacks on US. soil were imminent. General Hayden\nsaid this was a ?tactical decision.?\n\nTOP SE CRE OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nOn 2 October 2001, General Hayden briefed the House\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) on this decision and\nlater informed members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(SSCI) by telephone. He had also informed DCI George Tenet.\n\n(TS) At the same time NSA was assessing collection gaps and increasing\nefforts against terrorist targets immediately after the 11 September attacks, .\nit was responding to Department of Defense (DOD), Director of Central\nIntelligence Community Management Staff questions about its ability to\ncounter the new threat.\n\n(U) Need to Expand NSA Authority\n\nNSA\n\nGeneral Hayden said that soon after he told Mr. Tenet about\nNSA actions to counter the threat, Mr. Tenet shared the information with\nthe ?Oval Of?ce.? Mr. Tenet relayed that the Vice President wanted to\nknow if NSA could be doing more. General Hayden replied that nothing\nelse could be done within existing NSA authorities. In a follow-up\ntelephone conversation, Mr. Tenet asked General Hayden what could be\ndone if he had additional authorities. General Hayden said that these\ndiscussions were not documented.\n\nIdentifies SIGIN Collection Gaps\n\nTo respond to the Vice President, General Hayden met with\nNSA personnel who were already working to identify and ?ll SIGINT\ncollection gaps in light of the recent terrorist attacks. General Hayden\nstated that he met with personnel to identify which additional authorities\nwould be operationally useful and technically feasible. In particular,\ndiscussions focused on how NSA might bridge the ?international gap.? An\nNSA Technical Director described that gap in these terms:\n\n\"Here is NSA standing at the US. border looking outward for\nforeign threats. There is the FBI looking within the United\nStates for domestic threats. But no one was looking at the\nforeign threats coming into the United States. That was a\nhuge gap that NSA wanted to cover. \n\nPossible Solutions. Among other things, NSA considered\nhow to tweak transit collection?the collection of communications\ntransiting through but not originating or terminating in the United States.\nNSA personnel also resurfaced a concept proposed in 1999 to address the\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nMillennium Threat. NSA proposed that it would perform contact chaining\non metadata it had collected. would chain through masked U.S.\ntelephone numbers to discover foreign connections to those numbers,\nwithout specifying, even for the US. number involved. In\nDecember 1999, the Department of Justice Office of Intelligence\nPolicy Review (OIPR) told NSA that the proposal fell within one of the\nFISA de?nitions of electronic surveillance and, therefore, was not\npermissible when applied to metadata associated with presumed U.S.\npersons U.S. telephone numbers not approved for targeting by the\nFISC).\n\nCollection gaps not adequately filled by FISA\nauthorized intercept. NSA determined that FISA authorization did not\nallow sufficient ?exibility to counter the new terrorist threat. First, it\nbelieved that because of technological advances, the jurisdiction of the\n\nISC went beyond the original intent of the statute. For example, most\ncommunications signals no longer ?owed through radio Sig-Halssignals or\nvia phone svstems as they did in 1978 when the FISA was written. By\n2001, Internet communications were used worldwide, undersea cables\ncarried huge volumes of communications, and a large amount of the\nworld?s communications passed through the United States. Because of\nlanguage used in the Act in 1978, NSA was required to obtain court orders\nto target email accounts used by non-US. persons outside the United States\nif it intended to intercept the communications at a webmail service within\nthe United States. Large numbers of terrorists were using such accounts in\n200 1 .\n\nSecond, NSA believed that the FISA process was unable to\naccommodate the number of terrorist targets or the speed with which they\nchanged their communications. From the time NSA sent FISA requests to\nthe OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average wait was\nbetween four and six weeks. Terrorists could have changed their telephone\nnumbers or internet addresses before NSA received FISC approval to target\nthem. NSA believed the large number of terrorist targets and their\nfrequently changing communications would have overwhelmed the\nexisting FISA process.\n\nEmergency FISA provision not an option. NSA\ndetermined that even using emergency FISA court orders would not\nprovide the speed and ?exibility needed to counter the terrorist threat.\nFirst, although the emergency authorization provision permitted 72 hours\nof surveillance without obtaining a court order, it did not?as many\nbelieved?allow the Government to undertake surveillance immediately.\nRather, the Attorney General had to ensure that emergency surveillance\nwould ultimately be acceptable to the FISC. He had to be certain the court\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nwould grant a warrant before initiating emergency surveillance.\nAdditionally, before NSA surveillance requests were submitted to the\nAttorney General, they had to be reviewed by NSA intelligence officers,\nNSA attorneys, and Department of Justice attorneys. Each reviewer had to\nbe satis?ed that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the\nnext review group, and each request was certi?ed by a senior official in the\nusually the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. From the time NSA sent a\nrequest to Justice?s OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average\nwait was between half. In the existing threat\nenvironment with US. interests at risk, NSA deemed the wait too long.\n\n \n\nEarly Efforts to Amend FISA\n\nGiven the limitations of FISA, there were early\nefforts to amend the statute. For example, shortly after 11\nSeptember, the HPSCI asked NSA for technical assistance\nin drafting a proposal to amend Section of FISA that\nwould give the President the authority to conduct electronic\nsurveillances without a court order for the purpose of\nobtaining foreign intelligence information. On\n\n20 September 2001, the NSA General Counsel wrote to\nJudge Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the President, asking\nwhether the proposal had merit. We found no record of a\nreSponse.\n\nWe could not determine why early efforts to\namend FISA were abandoned. Anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that government of?cials feared the public debate\nsurrounding any changes to FISA would compromise\nintelligence sources and methods.\n\n \n\n \n\n(U) NSA identifies SIGINT collection gaps to Vice President?s Office.\n\nBecause early discussions about expanding authority\nwere not documented, we do not have records of speci?c topics discussed\nor people who attended General Hayden?s meetings with White House\nrepresentatives. General Hayden stated that after consulting with NSA\npersonnel, he described to the White House how NSA collection of\ncommunications on a wire inside the United States was constrained by the\nFISA statute. Speci?cally, NSA could not collect from a wire in the United\n\nTOP SE CRE OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nStates, without a court order, either content or metadata from\ncommunications links with either one or both ends in the United States.\nFurthermore, General Hayden pointed out that communications metadata\ndid not have the same level of constitutional protection as content and that\naccess to metadata of communications with one end in the United States\nwould signi?cantly enhance analytic capabilities. General Hayden\nsuggested that the ability to collect communications with one end in the\nUnited States without a court order would increase speed and\nagility. General Hayden stated that after two additional meetings with the\nVice President, the Vice President asked him to work with his Counsel,\nDavid Addington.\n\n(U) Presidential Authorization Drafted and Signed\n\n \n\nAccording to General Hayden, the Vice President?s\nCounsel, David Addington, drafted the ?rst Authorization. General\nHayden described himself as the ?subject matter expert? but stated that no\nother NSA personnel participated in the drafting process, including the\nGeneral Counsel. He also said that Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrepresentatives were not involved in any of the discussions that he attended\nand he did not otherwise inform them.\n\nGeneral Hayden said he was ?surprised with a small \nwhen the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, and that it only\nchanged the location from which NSA could collect communications.\n\nRules for minimizing US. person information still had to be followed.\n\nSIGINT Activity Authorized by the President\n\n \n\nOn 4 October 2001, the President delegated authority\nthrough the Secretary of Defense to the Director of NSA to conduct\nspeci?ed electronic surveillance on targets related to Afghanistan and\ninternational terrorism for 30 days. Because the surveillance included wire\nand cable communications carried into or out of the United States, it would\notherwise have required FISC authority.\n\nF) The Authorization allowed NSA to conduct four types\nof collection activity:\n\nTelephony content\n\nInternet content\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTelephony metadata\nInternet metadata\n\nF) NSA could collect the content and associated metadata of\ntelephony and Internet communications for which there was probable cause\nto believe that one of the communicants was in Afghanistan or that one\ncommunicant was engaged in or preparing for acts of international\nterrorism. In addition, NSA was authorized to acquire telephony and\nInternet metadata for communications with at least one communicant\noutside the United States or for which no communicant was known to be a\ncitizen of the United States. NSA was also allowed to retain, process,\nanalyze and disseminate intelligence from the communications acquired\nunder the authority.\n\nSubsequent Changes to the Authorization\n\nAfter the ?rst Presidential authorization, the speci?c terms,\nwording, or interpretation of the renewals periodically changed. (See\nAppendix for a completed listing of changes.)\n\nDomestic Collection. The wording of the ?rst\nauthorization could have been interpreted to allow domestic content\ncollection where both communicants were located in the US. or were U.S.\npersons. General Hayden recalled that when the Counsel to the Vice\nPresident pointed this out, General Hayden told him that NSA would not\ncollect domestic communications because 1) NSA was a foreign intelligence\nagency, 2) NSA infrastructure did not support domestic collection, and 3) his\npersonal standard was so high that there would be no problem getting a\nFISC order for domestic collection.\n\nF) Afghanistan. In January 2002, after the Taliban was forced\nout of power, Afghanistan was no longer speci?cally identi?ed in the\nAuthorization.\n\nIraqi Intelligence Service. For a limited period of time\nsurrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the President authorized the use of\nPSP authority against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. On 28 March 2003,\nthe DCI determined that, based on then current intelligence, the Iraqi\nIntelligence service was engaged in terrorist activities and presented a\nthreat to US. interests in the United States and abroad. Through the\nDeputy DCI, Mr. Tenet received the President?s concurrence that PSP\nauthorities could be used against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. NSA\nceased using the Authority for this purpose in March 2004.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) TWO: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTHORITY AND\nRESULTING SIGINT PRODUCT\n\nGeneral Hayden said that although he felt comfortable\nexercising the Presidential authorization and believed it to be legal, he\nrecognized that it was politically sensitive and controversial and would be\nsubjected to scrutiny at some point in time. He and NSA leadership strove\nto ensure that NSA personnel executed the terms of the Authorization with\ncare and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized.\nPSP-related operations began on 6 October. Early on, personnel worked\nunder the assumption that the Authorization was temporary and that\noperations would stop in the near future. After it became evident that the\nAuthority would be continuously renewed, management focused on\ndesigning processes and procedures for Program activity.\n\nStand Up of Operations\n\n \n\nOn 4 October 2001, after receiving the Authorization, General\nHayden informed the SIGINT Director and other key personnel of \nnew authorities and asked the NSA General Counsel if the Authorization\nwas legal. The General Counsel said that the next day, 5 October, he told\nGeneral Hayden that he believed it was legal (see Appendix D).\n\nUnder General Hayden?s direction, immediate steps were\ntaken to implement the temporary authority.\n\nA 24-hour watch operation, the Metadata Analysis Center (MAC),\nwas created in the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID).\n\nThe ?rst Program Manager was identi?ed and informed of his new\nresponsibilities.\n\nA cadre of experienced operational personnel was chosen to\nimplement the Program.\n\nOffice space was identi?ed to accommodate newly assigned\npersonnel.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n51109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n \n\nTOP SE CRE OF ORN\n\nA new security compartment with the temporary cover term\nSTARBURST was established.3\n\nFifty computer servers to store and process data acquired under the\nnew authority were ordered.4\n\nInitial funding of $25 million for PSP operations was obtained from\nthe DCI.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, 6 and 7 October, small groups of\noperational personnel were called at home and asked to report to work for\nspecial PSP clearance brie?ngs.\n\nOn Monday, 8 October 2001, Columbus Day, General\nHayden briefed the programmers, and mathematicians that had\nbeen selected to implement the Authorization. At that brie?ng, General\nHayden said he did not share the speci?c content of the Authorization with\nattendees but relayed key information such as:\n\nThe Authorization came from the President.\nThe Authorization was temporary.\n\nThe Authorization was intended to be an early warning system of\nimpending terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nThe NSA General Counsel had reviewed the Authorization and\nconcluded that it was legal.\n\nNSA would do exactly what the Authorization stated and ?not one\nelectron or photon more.?\n\nThe Authorization should be kept secret and it required strict\ncompartmentation. Attendees had to sign a non-disclosure\nagreement.\n\nGeneral Hayden stated that alter he briefed the attendees, he\nturned the brie?ng over to the General Counsel to discuss the terms of the\nAuthorization.\n\nA permanent cover term, STELLARWIND, was assigned to Program information on 31 October\n\n2001.\n\nF) Because of the heightened terrorist threat, at request, a vendor diverted a shipment of\nservers intended for other recipients to NSA, where they arrived under police escort on 13 October 2001.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n10\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) Early Operations\n\n \n\nWithin one week, approximately 90 NSA employees were\ncleared for access to the PSP. On 11 October 2001, the Associate General\nCounsel for Operations and the NSA Deputy General Counsel were cleared\nfor the Program and agreed with the NSA General Counsel?s determination\nthat the Authorization was legal. NSA OGC did not formally document its\nopinions or legal rationale (see Appendix D).\n\nThe MAC was created to analyze metadata obtained\nunder PSP authorization. By 7 October 2001, it was a 24-hour 7?day a\nweek watch center with 20 reporters, and software developers\nworking in three shifts. Many MAC employees were former Russian traffic\nwith manual call chaining analysis experience. Initially, the MAC\nreported directly to General Hayden and the Deputy Director. The MAC\nChief briefed the Director every week, and the Deputy Director visited\nMAC spaces for a brie?ng each evening.\n\nWhile the MAC was setting up to analyze PSP metadata, the\nCounterterrorism (CT) Product Line was realigning to conduct PSP content\ntasking and analysis. The MAC and the CT Product Line worked closely\ntogether to coordinate efforts and share information. The CT Product Line\nwas growing rapidly as handpicked employees were moved to support the\nnew mission.\n\nWithin 30 days, the PSP was fully operational. While\nawaiting delivery-of requested computer servers, the FBI and CLA gave\nNSA lead telephone numbers, and the MAC was able to immediately chain\nwithin the United States with SIGINT collected overseas. Private sector\npartners began to send telephony and Internet content to NSA in October\n2001. They began to send telephony and Internet metadata to NSA as early\nas November 2001.\n\n(UIIFOUO) On-Going Operations\n\n \n\nAfter operations began and it became evident that the\nAuthorization was likely to be renewed inde?nitely, NSA management\nbecame increasingly focused on designing processes and procedures to\nimplement the Program effectively and to ensure compliance with the\nAuthorization.\n\nTOP SE CRE CONZN OF ORN\n\n11\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109?0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) Organizational Structure\n\nNSA conducted all PSP analysis and reporting at its\nheadquarters at Ft. Meade, Maryland, within the SIGIN Directorate.\nSpeci?cally, tasking approvals, analysis, and reporting were conducted in\nthe CT Product Line within SID, Analysis and Production. Collection of\ndata was managed in SID, Directorate for Acquisition. No PSP activities\nwere managed at NSA ?eld sites.\n\n \n\n . Start from ?.001 have]\n\nAlthough the formal chain of command for SIGINT\noperations was through SID, in practice, the Director and Deputy Director\nof managed the Program while keeping the SIGINT Director\ninformed. Over time, the SIGINT Director became more involved, but the\nDirector and Deputy Director always maintained direct operational control.\n\nProgram Manager. Five of?cials held the Program\nManager position over the life of the PSP.5 Initially, the Program Manager\nreported to the Chief of the CT Product Line. In 2004, the Program\nManager position was restructured as the SID Program Manager for CT\nSpecial Projects and elevated to report to the SIGINT Director. This\nallowed the Program Manager jurisdiction of PSP elements across SID, not\njust those within the Directorate for Analysis and Production. At that time,\nthe position was also formally designated as a senior level civilian position.\nA small staff was added to form the Program Management Office.\n\nSID Analysis and Production. Initially, the MAC\nanalyzed PSP metadata (data that describes the content, events, or networks\nassociated with SIGINT targets), while SIGINT Development in the CT\nProduct Line analyzed non-PSP metadata. The CT Product Line performed\nPSP content analysis. SIGINT Development, a separate organization\nwithin the SID, managed approvals for content tasking. In 2004, the\nanalysis and production of metadata and content were consolidated into a\nnew organization called the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD). AAD\nwas divided into three teams: intemet metadata, telephony metadata, and\ncontent.\n\nCoordination with FBI and CIA. By 2004, four FBI\nintegrees and two CLA integrees, operating under SIGINT authorities in\naccordance with written agreements, were co-located with NSA \n\n \n\nThe Chief of the CT Product Line was Acting Program Manager for a brief time in 2004.\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\n12\n\n(U) Metadata\n\nTOP SE CRE ONAV OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\ncleared The purpose of co-locating these individuals was to\nimprove collaborative analytic efforts.\n\nSID Data Acquisition. Through the life of the Program,\ndata collection was managed by Special Source Operations in SID, Data\nAcquisition Directorate. Collection managers were responsible for putting\ntelephone numbers and email selectors on PSP-authorized collection by\nprivate sector companies and taking them off collection.\n\nThe authority to collect bulk telephony and Internet metadata\nsigni?cantly enhanced ability to identify activity that may have been\nterrorist?related. Contact chaining is the process of building a network\ngraph that models the communication (e?mail, telephony, etc.) patterns of\ntargeted entities (peOple, organizations, etc) and their associates from the\ncommunications sent or received by the targets.6 Metadata is data that\ndescribes other data, speci?cally information that describes the content,\nevents or networks associated with SIGINT targets. For example, for an\nemail message, it would include the sender and recipient email addresses.\nIt does not contain the subject line or the text of the email; they are\nconsidered to be content. Likewise. for a telephone conversation. metadata\nwould include the called number and the calling number as well as the\nduration ofthe call.\n\n \n\nAlthough NSA had the capability to collect bulk telephony\nand Internet metadata prior to the PSP, its application was limited because\nNSA did not have the authority to collect communications in which one\nend (the number being called or the recipient address ofan e?mail) was in\nthe United States. PSP signi?cantly increased the data available to NSA\nand allowed them to create more thorough contact chaining. This\ngave NSA the key to an early warning system?the ability to identify\nindividuals in the United States or individuals outside the US. using US.\ntelecommunications structures in contact with a foreign target, a terrorist.\n\nBecause metadata was not constitutionally protected, NSA\ndid not consider it to be as sensitive as content collection. Nevertheless,\nprocesses were set up to document requests for metadata analysis and\njusti?cations for conducting such analysis under Program authority. The\n\n \n\n6 Additional chaining can be performed on the associates? contacts to determine patterns in\nthe way a network of targets may communicate. Additional degrees of separation from the initial target are\nreferred to as ?hops.? For example a direct contact is one hop away from the target. A contact of the direct\ncontact would be described as being 2 hops away from the target. The resulting contact-graph is subsequently\nanalyzed for intelligence and to develop potential investigative leads.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nI3\n\nT-09- 0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SECRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\nfollowing describes the process used to obtain requests, conduct analysis,\nand report results under the PSP. (See Appendix for a ?owchart of the\nend-to-end process.)\n\nRequests for Information and Leads. Contact chaining\nanalysis requests were received from FBI, CIA, or NSA. Requests\ntypically took one of two forms, Requests for Information (RF 1) and Leads.\nRFIs were speci?c questions about a target?s telephone numbers or email\naddresses, called ?selectors? at NSA. Leads were more general requests\nabout a target?s contacts. Requestors submitted leads to discover new\ninvestigative leads. Contact chaining requests were documented from the\ninception of the PSP.\n\nApprovals to Chain. Prior to chaining, NSA\ncounterterrorism shift coordinators reviewed chaining requests to\ndetermine whether they met criteria provided by the OGC and based on the\nterms of the Authorization. They had to have enough information to\nidentify a terrorism nexus and demonstrate compliance with criteria\nrequired by the Authorization before analysis could begin. Shift\ncoordinators either approved requests, approved them for 1-hop (direct\ncontact) analysis, or denied them. Approved requests were passed to\nfor contact chaining.\n\nAnalysis. NSA used a variety of tools to conduct\nmetadata analysis and View the results. primary tool for conducting\nmetadata analysis, for PSP and traditional SIGINT collection, was\nMAINWAY. MAINWAY was used for storage, contact chaining, and for\nanalyzing large volumes of global communications metadata. At the\nbeginning of the PSP, only the Navigator? tool was available to\nView MAINWAY output. Over time, new tools and new processes, such as\nautomated chaining alerting, were created to improve efficiency.\nTo obtain the most complete results, used data collected under PSP\nand non-PSP authorities. Typically, they analyzed networks with two\ndegrees of separation (two hops) from the target. determined if\nresulting information was reportable.\n\nIn addition, an automated chaining alert process was\ncreated to alert of new potentially reportable selectors. Previously\napproved selectors were compared to incoming MAINWAY data\nauthorized by the PSP, E.O. 12333, or the FISC. Alerts of direct contacts\nwith approved selectors were reported to NSA for further analysis\nand potential reporting to FBI and CIA.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n14\n\n(U) Content\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nStorage. NSA stored metadata obtained under PSP\nauthorities in a protected database. Only cleared and trained were\ngiven access to PSP metadata.\n\nReporting. Reports based on metadata analysis were\ntypically referred to as ?tippers.? Tippers contained contact chaining\nanalysis results relevant to terrorism or with potential links to terrorism that\nwarranted the attention of the FBI or the CIA for further investigation.\nBefore releasing reports with US. person information, obtained\npermission to do so in accordance with established NSA dissemination\nprocedures.\n\nFor each published report, NSA retained documentation\nof the analysis, supporting RFI or lead information, and a justi?cation\nstatement explaining the link to terrorism. If a report was not published,\ndocumentation was not retained. Counterterrorism personnel manually\nupdated information in a computer tracking system to re?ect the\ndisposition of chaining requests.\n\nCollection and analysis of content is traditional wav of\nreporting  SIGINT. Content generally refers to words\nspoken during a telephone conversation or the written text of an email\nmessage. NSA collection of the content of telephony and Internet\ncommunications under the PSP improved its ability to produce intelligence\non terrorist-related activity. For example, by allowing NSA access to links\ncarrying communications with one end in the United States, NSA\nsigni?cantly increased its access to transiting foreign communications, \nwith both communicants outside the United States. General Hayden\ndescribed this as ?the real gold of the Program.? And, by allowing the\nintercept of international communications, NSA was able to identify threats\nwithin the United States.\n\nFrom the start of the Program until January 2007, NSA issued\n490 reports based on PSP?derived content information. Also, as shown\nbelow, approximately 37,664 telephony and Internet selectors were tasked\nfor\n\nPSP-authorized content collection during that time period. Only 8 percent\nwere U.S. targets.

As such, processes were set up to\nensure strict compliance with the terms of the Authorization. The\nfollowing describes the general process for tasking, collecting, storing and\nreporting telephony and Internet content under the PSP. (See Appendix \nfor a ?owchart of the end-to-end process.)\n\nTasking Approvals. Under the PSP, each domestic\nselector tasked for content collection was formally approved and tracked.\nsubmitted content collection requests, also called tasking\npackages, to the Chief of CT for approval. Tasking packages contained a\nnarrative analysis, conclusion, supporting information, documentation, and\na checklist of package contents. In the Chief ?s absence, the Deputy Chief\nof CT or the Program Manager could approve the requests. The approving\nofficials reviewed the tasking packages to ensure that the proposed target\nand related metadata selectors met criteria in the Authorization. If criteria\nwere not met, the officials requested additional information or denied the\nrequest. In limited cases, collection was approved for speci?c time\nperiods. If the content contained foreign intelligence, the time period for\ncollection would be extended. If it did not, collection was stopped. All\napprovals were documented in tasking packages.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n16\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nForeign selectors tasked for PSP content collection did not\nrequire formal approvals or tasking packages. were responsible\nfor determining whether a foreign selector met the criteria for foreign\n\nintelligence \n\nCollection. After a  selector was approved for PSP\n collection, it was identi?ed as ?tasked? in the STELLARWIND\nAddresses Database by tasking managers who then emailed a\ncollection tasking request to the SSO Collection Manager for telephony\nand Internet content collection. Foreign selector content collection\nrequests were sent directly to the SSO Collection Manager. They did not\nrequire special approval.\n\nSSO collection managers were responsible for\nensuring that telephony and Internet content selectors were put on or taken\noff collection. For telephen?elephonv content selectors, collection\nmanagers sent content collection tasking instructions to private sector\ncompanies. Private sector companies were responsible for implementing\ntasking at front-end devices to obtain the required content collection. For\nlntemet content selectors, collection managers sent content tasking\ninstructions directly to equipment installed at\n\ncompany?controlled locations. Collected data was sent back to \nand made available to through the HYBRID voice processing\nsystem for telephony content selectors or the PINWALE database for\nInternet content selectors. SSO collection managers worked with private\nsector companies and the CT Product Line to ensure that collected data was\nas intended and legally authorized.\n\nStorage. Content (voice or dData) collected under PSP was\nstored in protected partitions in existing NSA databases. Access to the\npartitions was restricted to PSP-cleared personnel.\n\nReporting. After analyzing content data collected under\nPresidential authority and identifying foreign intelligence information,\ncounterterrorism wrote reports. After an initial review within the\nCT Product Line, some reports were sent to SID Oversight and Compliance\nfor a second review for US. person identities. reviewers\ndetermined whether the US. identities in the report were necessary to\nassess or understand the foreign intelligence information being reported \nwas required within the conduct of recipient?s of?cial duties . If an identity\nwas found to be unnecessary, it was not reported. Before any US. person\ninformation was disseminated in reporting, internal NSA approvals were\nobtained as required by United States Signals Intelligence Directive\nSP0018 Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures.\n\n \n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n17\n\nT-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OF ORN\n\nInitially, NSA responded to FBI and CIA information\nrequests in email. These initial reports, sometimes called\n?Tippers? or ?Snippets,? were ?hidden in plain sight,? meaning the\ninformation in the report did not reveal the source of the information.\nLater, FBI and CIA wanted to understand how NSA knew certain\ninformation that could not be provided in normal reporting channels.\nEventually, ?tear line? reporting was established. Tear lines are used\nregularly by NSA as a way to report SIGINT-derived information and\nsanitized information in the same report to appropriately cleared\nindividuals. The sanitized ?tear line? information conveys the same basic\nfacts as the COMINT?controlled information while hiding COMIN as the\nsource.\n\nDissemination of SIGINT Product\n\n \n\nRegardless of which organization submitted requests or leads\nto NSA, all resulting reports were sent to CIA and FBI. Reports answered\nspeci?c RFI questions or provided new investigative leads developed from\nchaining analysis. Reports contained selectors of interest (potential leads)\nwith potential terrorist connections, not full chaining results. NSA had\nminimal insight into how CIA and FBI used PSP products.\n\n(U) Discovery Requests\n\n \n\n(U) On occasion, the Department of Justice attorneys determine that\nthe facts of a particular matter justify a search of NSA ?les and submit a\nsearch request. In response to those requests or in response to discovery\norders, NSA conducts a search of its databases to locate records that may\nfall within the scope of DoJ?s discovery obligations and Rule 16 of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Typically the search process begins\nwith a written request from including the names and aliases of\nindividuals.

The original Authorization and renewals were kept\nin the NSA Director?s safe, and access to the documents was \ncontrolled. By January 2007, nearly 3,000 people had been briefed\non the PSP, including members of Congress and the FISC.\n\n(U) Access to Legal Reviews\n\n \n\nThe NSA did not have access to the early Of?ce of\nLegal Counsel (OLC) opinions supporting the Attorney General?s\nstatement that the PSP was legal. General Hayden, NSA lawyers, and the\nNSA Inspector General agreed that it was not necessary for them to see the\nearly Opinions in order to execute the terms of the Authorization, but felt it\nwould be helpful to do so. NSA was, however, given access and provided\ncomments to the OLC opinion issued in 2004.\n\n(U) Access to Original Legal Review\n\nTwo NSA requests for access to the original OLC legal\nopinion were denied.\n\nFirst Request. NSA General Counsel Robert Deitz stated that\nhe asked the Vice President?s Counsel if he could see the opinion. Even\nthough Mr. Deitz?s request was denied, the Vice President?s Counsel read a\nfew paragraphs of the opinion to him over the classi?ed telephone line]\n\nSecond Request. At a 8 December 2003 meeting with the\nAssociate Deputy Attorney General to discuss collection of metadata\nand an upcoming NSA OIG compliance audit, IG and Deputy GC\nrequested to see the OLC legal opinion. The Counsel to the Vice President,\nwho unexpectedly attended the meeting, denied the request and said that\nany request to see the opinion had to come directly from General Hayden.\n\nGeneral Hayden stated he never asked for or read the OLC\nlegal opinion supporting the PSP. The Deputy GC stated that it was his\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n21\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OF ORN\n\nunderstanding that the opinion was not shared with NSA because it was\nconsidered con?dential legal advice to the President.\n\nThe IG, GC, and Deputy GC agreed that their inability to read\nthe OLC opinion did not prevent or impair them from executing and\noverseeing the Program. They were able to determine legality of the\nProgram independently from DOJ (see Appendix D). However, the IG said\nthat he found the secrecy surrounding the legal rationale to be ?odd.?\nSpeci?cally, he said that it was ?strange that NSA was told to execute a\nsecret program that everyone knew presented legal questions, without\nbeing told the underpinning legal theory.? The IG, GC, and Deputy GC all\nstated that they had yet to see the full text of the original OLC opinion.\n\nAccess to the May 2004 Opinion\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, the Associate Deputy Attorney General\nand the OLC Assistant Attorney General visited NSA to receive brie?ngs\non the PSP. On 04 May 2004, NSA, at the request of the OLC Assistant\nAttorney General, provided comments on the draft opinion on the\nLegality of the PSP. The OLC Assistant Attorney General submitted his\nopinion on 06 May 2004.\n\nAccess to the Presidential Authorization\n\n \n\nF) As directed by the White House, access to the original\nPresidential authorization and subsequent renewals was controlled.\n\n(C) The Vice President?s Counsel drafted the Authorizations and personally\ndelivered them to NSA. On a few occasions, NSA picked up the\nAuthorization at the White House.\n\n(C) The ?rst Authorization and subsequent renewals were kept in a safe in\nthe Director?s office. Initially, access was limited to General Hayden and a\nfew others, including three OGC attorneys, Program Managers, and certain\nOperational personnel. Those with access were not allowed to disseminate\nthe Authorizations.\n\nImportantly, most NSA operations personnel, including the\nChief of the CT Product Line, who approved tasking for content collection,\nwere not allowed to see the actual authorization. Rather, OGC answered\ntargeting, information sharing, and implementation legal questions on an\n?on call? basis for operators. When the Authorization changed, OGC\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nsummarized those changes in emails distributed to key program executives\nor communicated changes in due diligence meetings.\n\nSuch limited access to the Authorization was documented\nin an IG investigation as a primary cause of two early violations of the\nAuthorization. At the recommendation, in March 2003, General\nHayden began issuing Delegation of Authority letters that explained the\nAuthorization as it applied to executing the Program. A new Delegation of\nAuthority was promulgated with each renewal of the Authorization. The\nDelegation of Authority letters were sent to the Program Manager and the\ntwo managers of the SID CT Product Line and not further disseminated.\n(See Section Six.)\n\n(U) Access to Program Information\n\n \n\nBetween 4 October 2001 and 17 January 2007, NSA\ncleared over 3,000 people for the PSP. The majority worked at NSA.\nOthers were from the CIA, the FBI, the Department of Justice, Congress,\nthe FISC, the ODNI, the White House, and the DOD.\n\nPSP Clearance Totals\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAgency Number of Cleared\nPersonnel\nNSA 1,936\nCIA 460\nFBI 467\nDOJ 64\nCongress 60\n\n \n\n \n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\n23\n\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE ORN\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFISC 14\nODNI 13\nWhite House 14\nDOD (excluding NSA) 5\nTotal 3,033\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWithin the ?rst 30 days of the Program, over 190\npeople were cleared into the Program.

By June 2002, over 500 people had been cleared, including two\nadditional members of Congress, Senator Daniel Inouye and former\nSenator Theodore Stevens, as well as FISC Judge Colleen Kollar?Kotelly.\nSee Appendix for a list, by date, of the number of people briefed into the\nProgram.\n\n(U) Non-Operational Personnel\n\nF) Knowledge of the PSP was strictly limited at the express\ndirection of the White House. General Hayden, over time, delegated his\nPSP clearance approval authority for NSA, FBI, and CIA operational\npersonnel working the mission to the NSA PSP Program Manager. For\nmembers of Congress, FISC, outside counsel for providers, and the NSA\nIG, General Hayden had to Obtain approval from the White House.\n\nFrom the start, General Hayden and NSA leadership pushed to\nkeep members of the legislative and judicial branches of government\ninformed. General Hayden said he told the Vice President that he had no\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nconcerns about the lawfulness of the Authorization but worried about the\npolitics. After some hesitancy, the White House gave General Hayden\npermission to brief certain members of Congress. In addition, the Chief\nJudge of the FISC was ?rst cleared in January 2002 (see Section \n\nInteractions with Members of Congress. Between 25\nOctober 2001 and 17 January 2007, General Hayden, sometimes supported\nby operational target experts from the CT Product Line and SSO of?ce,\nconducted over 49 brie?ngs to members of Congress or their sta?.

He\nsaid that during the many PSP-related brie?ngs he gave to members of\nCongress, no one ever said that NSA should stop what it was doing. He\nemphasized that he did not just \"?ip through slides\" during the brie?ngs.\nThey lasted as long as attendees desired.\n\nInteractions with the FISC. On 31 January 2002, Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth was briefed on the PSP and on 17 May 2002, his\n\nsuccessor, Colleen Kollar?Kotelly, was briefed. A law clerk was also\nbriefed in April 2004. (See Section Five.)\n\nThe Clearance Process\n\nF) NSA managed the NSA clearance process. Clearance\nrequests were submitted to the PSP Program Office for Program Manager\napproval or disapproval. Access was granted only to those who needed it\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\n25\n\nT-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nto perform assigned job duties. The Program Manager questioned access\nrequests with unclear justi?cations. Approved requests were forwarded to\nthe Program security officer, who performed a security check. If the\nsecurity check yielded nothing to impede access, individuals were\ninstructed to go to the security of?ce to read the ?Security Pre?Brief\nAgreement? and sign a ?Sensitive Compartmented Information\nNondisclosure Agreement? form. General Counsel also had the\nauthority to read in Attorneys from other agencies.\n\nOn 20 May 2005, the Program Manager changed the PSP\nclearance request and re?certi?cation process. The Project Security Of?cer\nassigned to Special Source Operations in the SIGINT Directorate assumed\nresponsibility for the PSP clearance process. (Special Source Operations\nmanaged all PSP-related collection for NSA.) Additionally, the Program\nManager initiated PSP clearance brie?ngs.\n\nFrom 4 October 2001 until 23 May 2005, a two?level PSP\nclearance structure was used. One level was limited to the ?fact of?\nProgram existence. A second level included access to PSP targeting data\nthrough a ?must know? principle. Access lists were maintained in the SSO\nSecurity Director?s Office on an internal SSO compartmented LAN.\n\nF) Regular zero-based reviews were conducted by the SSO\nSecurity Director?s Of?ce quarterly to validate that cleared individuals had\na continuing need for access to PSP information. The clearance did not\nautomatically transfer with individuals who moved to new assignments.\nThe clearance had to be re-justi?ed for the new position, or the individual\nwould be debriefed from the Program.\n\nTOP SECRE OMIN CONAV OF ORN\n\n26\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) FOUR: NSA PRIVATE SECTOR RELATIONSHIPS\n\nTo conduct foreign intelligence-gathering activities\nunder the PSP, NSA required the assistance of private companies,\nwhich provided access to international communications chokepoints\nin United States. Immediately after 11 September 2001, some private\ncompanies contacted NSA to offer support. Subsequent to PSP\nauthorization, NSA sent request letters to companies stating that\ntheir assistance was authorized by the President with legal\nconcurrence of the Attorney General.\n\n(U) Need for Private Sector Cooperation\n\n \n\nThe United States carries out foreign intelligence activities\nthrough a variety of means. One of the most effective means is to partner\nwith commercial entities to obtain access to information that would not\notherwise be available.\n\nTelephony\n\nMost international telephone calls are routed through a small\nnumber of switches or ?chokepoints? in the international telephone\nswitching system en route to their ?nal destination. The United States is a\nmajor crossroads for international switched telephone traffic. For example,\nin 2003, circuit switches worldwide carried approximately 180 billion\nminutes of telephone communications. Twenty percent of this amount,\nover 37 billion minutes, either originated or terminated in the United\nStates, and another thirteen percent, over 23 billion minutes, transited the\nUnited States (neither originating nor terminating here). is\nauthorized under Executive Order 12333 to acquire transiting telephone\ncalls]\n\nF) NSA determined that under the Authorization it could gain\naccess to approximately 81% of the international calls into and out of the\nUnited States through three corporate partners: COMPANY A had access to\n39%, COMPANY 28%, and COMPANY 14%. NSA did not seek\nassistance from local exchange carriers, because that would have given\nNSA access primarily to domestic callsCRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nInternet Communications\n\nF) Al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations have made\nextensive use of the Internet. It is their preferred method of\ncommunication. Terrorists use Internet communications, particularly web?\nbased services, because they are ubiquitous, anonymous, and usually free\nof charge. They can access Web?based email accounts and similar services\nfrom any origination point around the world.\n\nThe United States is a major Internet communications hub.\nThe industry standard for characterization of the volume of Internet\ncommunications is bandwidth, which measures the amount of digital data\ntransmitted in one second bits per second or bps. For example, data\navailable from 2002 shows that at that time, worldwide international\nbandwidth was more than 290 Gbps7. Of that total, less than 2.5\nwas between two regions that did not include the United States.\n\nThe United States is also home to computer servers providing\nInternet communications services often used by terrorists. The majority of\nknown terrorist email addresses that NSA has tracked are hosted on U.S.-\n\nbased providers or forei n?mana ed roviders hosted on servers in the\nUnited  \n\n(UIIFOUO) Evolution of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n\n \n\n(U) History of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n\nAs far back as World War II, NSA has had classi?ed\nrelationships with carefully vetted US. companies that assist with essential\nforeign intelligence-gathering activities. NSA maintains relationships with\nover 100 US. companies. Without their cooperation, NSA would not be\nable respond to intelligence requirements on a variety of topics important\nto the United States.\n\nTwo of the most productive SIGINT collection partnerships\nthat NSA has with the private sector are with COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY B. These two relationships enable NSA to access large\nvolumes of foreign-to-foreign communications transitng the United States\n\n \n\nis an abbreviation for Gigabits per second, which can also be described as one billion bits per second\nor 1,000,000,000 bps.\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n28\n\nTOP SECRE ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nthrough ?ber-Optic cables, gateway switches, and data networks. They also\nprovide foreign intelligence authorized under the FISA.\n\nAccording to General Alexander, General Hayden?s\nreplacement as Director of if the relationships with these\ncompanies were ever terminated, the US. SIGINT system would be\nirrevocably damaged, because NSA would have sacri?ced America?s home\n?eld advantage as the primary hub for worldwide telecommunications.\n\n(U) Partnerships after 11 September 2001\n\nAccording to the former Deputy Chief of SSO, between 11\nSeptember 2001 and the 4 October 2001 Authorization, COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY contacted NSA and asked ?what can we do to help??\nCOMPANY personnel approached NSA SSO personnel through an\nexisting program. They said they noticed odd patterns in domestic calling\nrecords surrounding the events of 11 September and offered call records\nand analysis. With no appropriate authority under which to accept the call\nrecords, NSA suggested the company contact the FBI.\n\nPartnerships Supporting the PSP\n\nF) Once the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, NSA\nbegan a process of identifying and visiting commercial entities requesting\ntheir support. While requesting help from corporate entities to support the\nPSP, NSA personnel made it clear that the PSP was a cooperative program\nand participation was voluntary. NSA knew that the PSP was an\nextraordinary program and understood if companies viewed it as too much\nof a liability.\n\nNSA Approaches to Private Sector Companies\n\n2001: On Columbus Day, 8 October 2001, NSA Special\nSource Operations (SSO) personnel responsible for the access relationships\nwith corporate partners COMPANY A, COMPANY B, and COMPANY \nwere called in to work and informed that the President had authorized the\nPSP on 4 October 2001. The SSO personnel were tasked with initiating a\ndialog with the respective TS/SCI-cleared of?cials from COMPANIES A,\nB, and to seek their cooperation under the new Authorization. Over the\nnext few business days, SSO personnel met separately with o??icials from\nthe three companies. Each company agreed to cooperate.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n29\n\n7109?0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nUpon con?rmation that formal NSA letters requesting their\nassistance were forthcoming, the providers, acting independently and\nof?cially unaware of the cooperating agreements with other companies,\ninitiated collection to support the PSP.\n\n2002: In early 2002, NSA SSO personnel met with the Senior\nVice President of Government Systems and other employees from\nCOMPANY E. Under the authority of the PSP, NSA asked COMPANY \nto provide call detail records (CDR) in support of security for the 2002\nOlympics in Salt Lake City. On 11 February 2002, the company?s CEO\nagreed to cooperate with NSA. On 19 February 2002, COMPANY \nsubmitted a written proposal that discussed methods it could use to\nregularly replicate call record information stored in a COMPANY facility\nand potentially forward the same information to NSA. Discussions with\nCOMPANY continued in 2003. However, the COMPANY General\nCounsel ultimately decided not to support NSA.\n\nOn 5 September 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with intemet provider COMPANY D?s General Counsel to discuss the\nPSP and ask for the company?s support. COMPANY provided support,\nbut it was minimal. (For a description of COMPANY D?s support, see\npage ?What Providers \n\nOn 29 October 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with intemet provider COMPANY F?s Legal and Corporate Affairs\npersonnel, and a former NSA OGC employee hired by COMPANY as\nindependent counsel. NSA requested COMPANY F?s support under the\nPSP for email content. At the meeting, COMPANY requested a letter\nfrom the Attorney General certifying the legality of the PSP. In December\n2002, Commercial Technologies Group was informed that the\ncompany?s CEO agreed to support the PSP. According to General\nCounsel, COMPANY did not participate in the PSP because of corporate\nliability concerns.\n\nF) 2003: In April 2003, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with the President and Chief Operating Of?cer, General Counsel, and\nother personnel from private sector COMPANY G. After the meeting, the\ncompany?s General Counsel wanted to seek the opinion of outside counsel.\nNSA determined the risk associated with additional disclosure outweighed\nwhat COMPANY would have provided.

NSA OGC drafted the letters for\nthe Director, tracked each renewal of the President?s _authorization and\nmodi?ed the letters accordingly, and ensured the letters were delivered to\nthe companies. Between 16 October 2001 and 14 December 2006, NSA\nsent 147 request-for?assistance letters to private sector partners.\n\nCOWANY A: 44 Letters\nCOMPANY B: 44 Letters\nCOMPANY C: 46 Letters\nCOMPANY D: 11 Letters\nCOMPANY E: 2 Letters\n\n2001. In his ?rst PSP-related letter on 16 October 2001\nto COMPANIES A, and C, General Hayden stated that the National\nSecurity Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation required their\nassistance ?to collect intelligence vital to the national security arising from\nthe events of 11 September 2001,? and speci?cally requested that they\n?provide survey, tasking and collection against international traffic, some\nof which terminates in the United States; provide aggregated call record\ninformation; and supply computer to computer data which can be used to\ndetermine the communicants.? Their assistance was ?needed to identify\nmembers of international terrorist cells in the United States and prevent\nfuture terrorist attacks against the United States.? These ?rst letters also\nstated that the requested assistance was authorized by the President with\nthe legal concurrence of the Attorney General, pursuant to Article II of the\nConstitution.\n\n2002: Subsequent letters were sent to COMPANIES A,\nB, and by General Hayden (or his deputy) each time the President\nreauthorized the PSP. Throughout 2002, these written requests for\nassistance referenced the 16 October letter; repeated the need to provide\nthe Presidentially?authorized assistance; emphasized that such assistance\nwas necessary to counter a ?iture terrorist attack; and stated that such\nassistance was reviewed by the Attorney General and had been determined\nto be a lawful exercise of the President?s powers as Commander-in-Chief.\nStarting in mid-2003, the wording of the letters was revised but in\nsubstance remained the same.\n\nTwo request letters for assistance were sent to private\nsector COMPANY E.

The ?rst\nletter was on 9 October 2002 and the last letter was 11 September 2003.\nAll letters were signed by General Hayden or his designee.\n\n2003: In June 2003, COMPANY C?s General Counsel\nand Chief of Staff requested a written Attorney General opinion on the\nlegality and lawfulness of the PSP, to include a directive to comply.\nCOMPANY cited corporate liability concerns as their reason. On 8\nAugust 2003, the Attorney General sent COMPANY a letter stating that\nthe request for support was a lawful exercise of authorities assigned to the\nPresident under Article II of the Constitution. Additionally, the Attorney\nGeneral directed COMPANY to comply with request.\n\n2004: On 26 March 2004, the President amended his 11\nMarch 2004 authorization after deciding to discontinue bulk collection of\nInternet metadata. Before 11 March 2004, all authorizations covering\nInternet metadata collection (as well as content collection and telephony\nmetadata collection) were approved for form and legality by the Attorney\nGeneral. Accordingly, 12 March 2004 letters to the companies\nstated that the most recent authorization had been approved for form and\nlegality by the Counsel to the President, not the Attorney General as with\nprevious authorizations.\n\n2005: Beginning 19 September 2005 through 14\nDecember 2006, new Director General Alexander, or his\ndesignee, signed the request letters to the companies.\n\n2006 Attorney General Letters. On 24 January 2006,\nthe Attorney General sent letters to COMPANIES A, B, and C, certifying\nunder 18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(a)(ii)(B) that ?no warrant or court order was or is\nrequired by law for the assistance, that all statutory requirements have been\nmet, and that the assistance has been and is required.?\n\n2006 DNI Letters. On 13 April 2006, the Director of\nNational Intelligence (DNI) sent letters to Companies A, B, and to\nunderscore the continuing critical importance of their assistance.

COMPANY sometimes picked up its\nletters at NSA Headquarters. Letters for COMPANY were stored at NSA\nsince no one at the company had the proper clearance to store them.\n\nPSPAuthorized'Support to NSA\n\nPrivate sector companies provided assistance to NSA\nunder the PSP in three categories: telephone and Internet Protocol content,\nMetadata from Call Detail Records, and Internet Protocol Metadata.\n\nF) The PSP allowed content to be collected if the selected\ncommunication was one-end foreign or the location of the communicants\ncould not be determined. Selectors (email addresses and telephone\nnumbers) were provided by Of?ce of Counterterrorism.\n\nF) Content: Telephony. Under the PSP, companies\nprovided the content of one-end?foreign international telephone calls\n(telephony content) and the content of electronic communications (email\ncontent) of al Qaeda and its affiliates. COMPANIES A, B, and provided\ntelephony content from communications links they owned and operated.\nThey had been providing telephony content to NSA before 2001 under\nFISA and ED. 12333 authorities. NSA began to receive telephony content\nfrom COMPANIES A and on 6 October 2001 and COMPANY on 7\nOctober 2001. This support ended on 17 January 2007.\n\nContent: Internet Email. COMPANIES A, B, and \nprovided access to the content of Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda?af?liate email\nfrom communication links they owned and operated. NSA received email\ncontent from COMPANY A as early as October 2001 until 17 January\n2007, from Company beginning February-March 2002 through 17\nJanuary 2007, and from COMPANY from April 2005 until 17 January\n2007. From April 2003 through November 2003, COMPANY provided\na limited amount of email content under the PSP. It did not provide PSP-\nrelated support after November 2003, but it did provide support under\nFISA.\n\nF) Metadata from Call Detail Records. COMPANIES A\nand provided Call Detail Records to NSA. The records were used by\nNSA Counter-Terrorism metadata to perform call chaining and\nnetwork reconstruction between known al Qaeda and al Qaeda-affiliate\ntelephone numbers and previously unknown telephone numbers with which\nthey had been in contact.

The Call Detail\nRecords were aggregated as large ?les by TS/SCI-cleared groups at\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY and forwarded, on an hourly or daily\nbasis, across classi?ed communications circuits to a PSP-restricted NSA\ndata repository.\n\nCOMPANY A provided PSP-authorized CDRs as early as November 2001,\nand COMPANY began to provide CDRs in February 2002. Both\ncontinued to provide this support through the end of the PSP, and support\ncontinues today under the FISC Business Records Order. COMPANY \nprovided select PSP-authorized CDRs from December 2002 through March\n2003.\n\nF) Internet Metadata. The last category of private sector\nassistance was access to Internet Protocol (IP) metadata associated with\ncommunications of al Qaeda (and af?liates) from data links owned or\noperated by COMPANIES A, B, and C. In order to be a candidate for PSP\nIP metadata collection, data links were ?rst vetted to ensure that the\npreponderance of communications was from foreign sources, and that there\nwas a high probability of collecting al Qaeda (and affiliate)\ncommunications.

Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who replaced Judge\nLamberth as Chief Judge in May 2002, and one law clerk were the only\nmembers of the FISC that NSA had briefed on the PSP. In the spring of\n2004, interaction with Judge Kollar- Kotelly increased as NSA and\nbegan transitioning PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders in 2004.\nIt was not until after parts of the PSP were publicly revealed in\n\nDecember 2005 that all members of the FISC were briefed on the\nProgram.\n\n(U) Interaction with the FISC\n\n \n\nGeneral Hayden stated that from the start of the PSP, he and\nother NSA leaders recognized the importance of keeping all three branches\nof the Government informed of the Program and pressed the White House\nto do so.\n\nIn all of its interactions, neither NSA nor presented\nbefore the FISC the factual and legal issues arising from the PSP in any\ncase or controversy. Therefore, the FISC did not express any view or\ncomment on the legality or illegality of the PSP.\n\nNSA Briefings on the PSP to Members of the FISC\n\nThe White House ?rst permitted NSA to brief the Chief Judge\nof the FISC in January 2002. General Hayden stated that on 31 January\n2002, he provided Judge Lamberth a very detailed PSP brie?ng, and the\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General in the OLC explained the\nProgram?s legality. General Hayden stated that this brie?ng was prompted\nby a concern expressed by DOJ that PSP-derived information would be\nused in ISA applications\n\nOn 17 May 2002, General Hayden briefed incoming Chief\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly, with Judge Lamberth in attendance, on the PSP. In a\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nletter to the Counsel for Intelligence Policy dated 12 January 2005, Judge\nKollar?Kotelly stated that, on that date, she was also shown a short legal\nmemorandum, prepared by the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the\nOLC, that set out a broad overview of the legal authority for\nconducting the PSP. Judge Kollar-Kotelly added that she was allowed to\nread the memorandum but not to retain it for study.\n\nNSA records show that Judge Kollar?Kotelly was briefed\nagain on 12 August 2002 at the White House. Although we found no\ndocumentation of the purpose of the meeting or topics discussed, Judge\nKollar?Kotelly stated in the January 2005 letter to the Counsel for\nIntelligence Policy that, at her request, she was permitted to review the\nAuthorization of the PSP on that date.\n\nIn response to a New York Times ?warrantless wiretapping?\nstory published in December 2005, General Alexander briefed all FISC\nmembers on the PSP on 9 January 2006.9\n\n(U) Transition of PSP Authorities to FISC Orders\n\n \n\nThe transition of PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders\nwas precipitated by preliminary results of OLC legal review of the\ncomponents of the Program. In March 2004, OLC found three of the four\ntypes of collection authorized under the PSP to be legally supportable.\nHowever, it determined that, given the method of collection, bulk Internet\nmetadata was prohibited by the terms of FISA and Title \nConsequently, the White House Counsel rather than the Attorney General\nsigned the 11 March 2004 Authorization.\n\n \n\nNSA Implements Controversial\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9 Scullin did not attend this brie?ng, but was later briefed on 31 January 2006.\nJudge Bates, a new judge, was briefed on 21 March 2006.\n\nOLC ultimately issued three opinions: 15 March 2004, 6 May 2004, and 16 July\n2004.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n37\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n \n\n \n\nUntil March 2004, NSA considered its\ncollection of bulk Internet metadata under the PSP to be\nlegal and appropriate. Speci?cally, NSA leadership,\nincluding OGC lawyers and the IG, interpreted the terms of\nthe Authorization to allow NSA to obtain bulk Internet\nmetadata for analysis because NSA did not actually\n?acquire? communications until specific communications\nwere selected. In other words, because the Authorization\npermitted NSA to conduct metadata analysis on Selectors\nthat met certain criteria, it implicitly authorized NSA to\nobtain the bulk data that was needed to conduct the\nmetadata analysis.\n\nOn 11 March 2004, General Hayden had to\ndecide whether NSA would execute the Authorization\nwithout the Attorney General?s signature 11).\nGeneral Hayden described a conversation in which David\nAddington asked, ?Will you do it (I 11 At that time,\nGeneral Hayden also said that he asked Daniel Levin,\nCounsel to the Attorney General, in March 2004 if he\nneeded to stop anything he was doing. Mr. Levin said that\nhe did not need to stop anything and \nAfter conferring with NSA operational and legal\npersonnel, General Hayden stated that he decided to\ncontinue the PSP because 1) the members of Congress he\nbriefed the previous day, 10 March, were supportive of\ncontinuing the Program, 2) he knew the value of the\nProgram, and 3) NSA lawyers had determined the Program\nwas legal.\n\n \n\nEight days later on 19 March 2004, the President rescinded the\nauthority to collect bulk Internet metadata and gave NSA one week to stop\ncollection and block access to previously collected bulk Internet metadata. NSA\ndid so on 26 March 2004. To close the resulting collection gap, and NSA\nimmediately began efforts to recreate this authority in what became the \norder. By January 2007, the remaining three authorities had also been replicated in\nFISC orders: the Business Records (BR) Order, the Foreign Content Order, and the\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n38\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nDomestic Content Order. On 1 February 2007, the ?nal Authorization was allowed\nto expire and was not renewed.\n\nTransition of Internet Metadata Collection to Pen Register/T rap\nand Trace Order Authority\n\nF) According to NSA personnel, the decision to transition\nInternet metadata collection to a FISC order was driven by At a\nmeeting on 26 March 2007, Do] directed NSA representatives from OGC\nand SID to ?nd a legal basis, using a FISC order, to recreate PSP\nauthority to collect bulk Internet metadata.\n\nAfter extensive coordination, and NSA devised the\ntheory to which the Chief Judge of the FISC seemed amenable.\nand NSA worked closely over the following months, exchanging\ndrafts of the application, preparing declarations, and responding to\nquestions from court advisers. NSA representatives explained the\ncapabilities that were needed to recreate the Authority, and personnel\ndevised a workable legal basis to meet those needs. In April 2004, NSA\nbriefed Judge Kollar?Kotelly and a law clerk because Judge Kollar?Kotelly\nwas researching the impact of using PSP-derived information in FISA\napplications. In May 2004, NSA personnel provided a technical brie?ng\non NSA collection of bulk Internet metadata to Judge Kollar?Kotelly. In\naddition, General Hayden said he met with Judge Kollar?Kotelly on two\nsuccessive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the on-going\nefforts.\n\nThe ISC signed the ?rst order on 14 July 2004.\nAlthough NSA lost access to the bulk metadata from 26 March 2004 until\nthe order was signed, the order essentially gave NSA the same authority to\ncollect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP, except that it\nspeci?ed the datalinks from which NSA could collect, and it limited the\nnumber of people that could access the data. The FISC continues to renew\nthe approximately every 90 days.\n\nTransition of Telephony Metadata Collection to the Business\nRecords Order\n\nAccording to NSA General Counsel Vito Potenza, the\ndecision to transition telephony metadata to the Business Records Order\nwas driven by a private sector company. After the New York Times article\nwas published in December 2005, Mr. Potenza stated that one of the PSP\nproviders expressed concern about providing telephony metadata to NSA\nunder Presidential Authority without being compelled. Although \n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n39\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nMay 2004 opinion states that NSA collection of telephony metadata as\nbusiness records under the Authorization was legally supportable, the\nprovider preferred to be compelled to do so by a court order.?\n\nAs with the Order, and NSA collaboratively\ndesigned the application, prepared declarations, and responded to questions\nfrom court advisers. Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT Order\nmade this process more efficient.\n\nThe ISC signed the ?rst Business Records Order on 24 May\n2006. The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk\ntelephony metadata from business records that it had under the PSP. And,\nunlike the PRTT, there was no break in collection at transition. The order\ndid, however, limit the number of people that could access the data and\nrequired more stringent oversight by and reporting to DOJ. The FISC\ncontinues to renew the Business Records Order every 90 days or so. (See\nAppendix H.)\n\nTransition of Internet and Telephony Content Collection to the\nForeign and Domestic Content Orders\n\nAccording to NSA OGC, the transition of PSP content\ncollection to FISC orders was driven by had contemplated a\ntransition in July 2004 when the signing of the order\nindicated its willingness to authorize PSP activities under court order.\nGiven this precedent, concluded the FISC might also accept content\ncollection. However, little progress was made until June 2005 when the\nOIPR with NSA OGC and SID representatives began researching the\nfeasibility of collecting PSP content under court order. In essence, DOJ\nand NSA needed to ?nd a legal theory that would allow NSA to add and\ndrop thousands of foreign targets for content collection. Because the law\nwas more restrictive for content than metadata, NSA had serious\nreservations about whether it would be possible to ?nd a workable solution\nusing a FISC order at that time, especially given the large number of\nselectors to be tasked and the complexity from legal and operational\nperspectives. For example:\n\n \n\nIn addition to the telephony metdata that NSA was receiving from private sector\ncompanies as business records, it was also obtaining ?live? telephony metadata from its own SIGINT\ncollection sources. It continued until mid-2005. will include a reference to the corresponding\n\nnoti?cation here.** \n\nTOP SE CRE TL OMIN OF ORN\n\n40\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN CONW OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nNSA risked losing ?exibility in the means of\ncollection, given that facilities and collection accesses were\ncomplex and in constant flux.\n\nIn executing the and Business Records Orders,\nthe and DoJ?s consistently increasing demands for\ninformation took NSA away from target-related duties.\n\nF) The process imposed by the FISA statute was not able\nto handle the large volume of NSA requests for FISC authorization\nneeded after\n11 September 2001.\n\nBecause May 2004 opinion found that the\nexisting Authorization for content collection was lawful, there was\nno pressing need to ?nd an alternative legal vehicle.\n\nIn a letter dated 21 February 2006, the NSA GC expressed the\naforementioned concerns, among others, to the Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral suggesting that:\n\n. . . . now might be the right time to seek substantial revisions to\nthe FISA. The purpose of the legislation was to protect the\nprivacy of US. persons who could be subjected to surveillance,\neither intentionally or incidentally. Twenty-seven years later, the\nUnited States Government ?nds itself obtaining FISA orders so\nthat it can cany out surveillance on foreign intelligence targets\nwho are outside the United States and, more o?en than not,\ncommunicating only with others outside the United States. This\nserves no US. person?s privacy interests, was never anticipated by\nthe statute?s drafters, and diverts valuable resources from the ?ght\nagainst terrorism. The FISA needs to be simpli?ed and\nstreamlined.?\n\nUltimately, decided to pursue a FISC order for content\ncollection wherein the traditional FISA de?nition of a ?facility? as a\nspeci?c telephone number or email address was changed to encompass the\ngateway or cable head that foreign targets use for communications.\nMinimization and probable cause standards would then be applied. As\nwith the PRTT and Business Records orders, NSA collaborated with Do] to\nprepare the application and declarations and provided the operational\nrequirements needed to continue effective surveillance.\n\nAfter 18 months of concerted effort and coordination, the\nFISC ultimately accepted the theory for foreign selectors but rejected it for\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n41\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\ndomestic selectors. Consequently, on 10 January 2007, the FISC signed\ntwo separate orders: the Foreign Content Order and the Domestic Content\nOrder.\n\nThe Foreign Content Order negatively affected SIGINT\nexploitation. Most notably, the number of foreign selectors on collection\ndropped by 73 percent, from 11,000 selectors under PSP to 3,000 under the\norder. In addition, the administrative workload for NSA to put\ncritical foreign selectors on collection was so burdensome that the order\nbecame operationally unsustainable. The order was eventually superseded\nby Congress? FISA modernization. It was temporarily replaced by the\nProtect America Act in August 2007 and then permanently replaced by the\nFISA Amendments Act in July 2008.\n\nF) The Domestic Content Order did not create a similar loss in\ncollection because so few domestic numbers were tasked at that time. It\ndid, however, slow operations because of the documentation required, and\nit took considerably longer to task under the order than under the PSP.\nOver time, the scope of the Domestic Content Order gradually decreased to\na single selector tasked for collection in January 2009. In January 2009,\nthe FBI, at request, assumed responsibility for the Domestic Content\nOrder and became the declarant before the FISCCRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) SIX: NSA OVERSIGHT OF PSP SIGINT ACTIVITIES\n\nNSA Office of General Counsel and SID, Oversight and\nCompliance provided oversight of NSA PSP activities from October 2001\nuntil January 2007. NSA OIG initiated PSP oversight in 2002.\n\n(U) Office of General Counsel\n\n \n\nThe OGC was the ?rst NSA organization with oversight\nresponsibilities to learn of the PSP, and it continued to provide signi?cant\noversight over the life of the Program. The GC was briefed on 4 October\n2001, the day the Authorization was signed. On 6 October, he gave the\nDirector and Deputy Director talking points for brie?ng NSA personnel on\nthe new authority. The talking points included the fact that General\nHayden had instructed the GC and the lead attorney for operations to\nconduct routine review and oversight of PSP activities.\n\nThe NSA Assistant General Counsel for Operations provided\nmost of the Program oversight before the OIG learned of the PSP in 2002.\nHe and his successors reviewed proposed target packages and rejected\nthose not compliant with the Authorization, answered questions, gave\nbrie?ngs, reviewed program implementation, and coordinated program-\nrelated issues with Do].\n\n(U) SIGINT Directorate\n\n \n\nThe SIGINT Directorate Office of Oversight and Compliance\nrepresents the Director and the Signals Intelligence\nDirector in overseeing compliance with authorities that govern the\ncollection, production, and dissemination of intelligence by the National\nSecurity Agency. The Chief of was briefed on the PSP on 10\nOctober 2001. Initially, ability to provide effective oversight was\nlimited by insufficient staf?ng and a lack of methodologies to provide\nmeaningful oversight of PSP collection. It, therefore, focused on\nidentifying problem areas while documenting program activity. It also\nhelped establish database partitions and assisted with data ?ow compliance\nissues to prevent uncleared personnel from seeing Presidentially-authorized\ncollection. Later, it reviewed justi?cation statements for tasked selectors.\nAlso, it directed PSP-cleared SIGINT operations personnel to follow\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n43\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nestablished procedures for the dissemination of US. person information\nand obtained approvals to permit dissemination of US. person information\n\n(U) Office of Inspector General\n\n \n\nNSA OIG conducted oversight of PSP activities from August\n2002 until the Program ended in January 2007. It issued 12 formal reports\nand 14 Presidential Noti?cations on PSP activities at NSA.\n\nInvestigations were conducted in response to speci?c incidents or\nviolations to determine the cause, effect, and remedy.\n\nReviews were conducted to determine the adequacy of management\ncontrols to ensure compliance with the Authorization and related\nauthorities; to assess the ef?ciency and effectiveness in mitigating\nhigh-risk activities associated with the Program; and to identify\nimpediments to satisfying the requirements of the Authorization and\nrelated authorities.\n\nPresidential Noti?cations were drafted for the Director?s signature\nto notify the President?s Counsel about violations of the\nAuthorization. (See below for additional details.)\n\nDue Diligence Meetings were held by program officials\nto exercise ?due diligence? in addressing program issues and\ndeveIOpments. The OIG attended these meetings to stay aware of\nprogram activities.\n\nOIG also provided oversight of FISC-authorized activity\npreviously conducted under Authorization.\n\nSee Appendix for a list of OIG reports on PSP activity at\nNSACRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n \n\n(U) NSA IG Not Cleared until 2002\n\nWe could not determine exact reasons for\nwhy the NSA was not cleared for the PSP until\nAugust 2002. According to the NSA General Counsel,\nthe President would not allow the to be briefed\nsooner. General Hayden did not speci?cally recall why\nthe IG was not brought in earlier, but thought that it\nhad not been appropriate to do so when it was\nuncertain how long the Program would last and before\noperations had stabilized. The NSA IG pointed out\nthat he did not take the IG position until April 2002, so\nNSA leadership or the White House may have been\nresistant to clearing either a new or an acting IG.\n\nRegardless, by August 2002, General\nHayden and the NSA General Counsel wanted to\ninstitutionalize oversight of the Program by bringing in\nthe IG. General Hayden recalled having to ?make a\ncase? to the White House to clear the IG at that time.\n\n \n\n \n\nOIG concerns lead to change\n\n(C) In addition to formal recommendations made in review and\ninvestigative reports, OIG concerns about access to the terms of the\nPresidential authorization and about the means of reporting PSP violations\nresulted in three major changes.\n\n(C) First, in December 2002, the IG recommended that General Hayden\nformally delegate authority to NSA operational personnel, some of whom\nhad unknowingly violated terms of the Authorization. The Counsel to the\nVice President, demanding secrecy, re?ised to let them see terms of the\nauthority, which had been delegated by the President to the Secretary of\nDefense, who delegated it to the Director of NSA. General Hayden issued\nthe ?rst ?Delegation of Authority? letter to key operational personnel in the\nSID on 4 March 2003. Subsequent delegation letters were issued each time\nthe President renewed the authority.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n45\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n(C) Second, in March 2003, the IG advised General Hayden that he should\nreport violations of the Authorization to the President. In February of\n2003, the OIG learned of PSP incidents or violations that had not been\nreported to overseers as required, because none had the clearance to see the\nreport.\n\nBefore March 2003, NSA quarterly reports on\nintelligence activities sent to the President?s Intelligence Oversight Board\n(through the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence\nOversight) stated that the Director was not aware of any unlawful\nsurveillance activities by NSA other than that described in the report.\nBeginning in March 2003, at the direction, NSA quarterly reports\nstated that except as disclosed to the President, the Director was not aware\nof any unlawful surveillance activities by NSA. Also beginning in March\n2003, PSP violations, including those not previously reported to the\nIntelligence Oversight Board, were reported in ?Presidential Noti?cations.?\n\nThird, shortly after learning about the Program, the IG\nparticipated in a September 2002 meeting of key cleared personnel at\nwhich important PSP matters were discussed. He recommended that these\ntypes of meetings be held every month. As a result, ?due\ndiligence? meetings were held until the Program ended.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nThis page intentionally left blank.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n47\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002 WORKING DRAFT\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n"

This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classi?cation instructions,\nwhile classi?cation guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an ISA/Protect America Act\nAmendments Act (FAA) classi?cation guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will\nreference an AA classi?cation guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by\nthe ISC. Also, this document references classi?cation guidelines for information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information\n(ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary.

The below column is unclassified in its\nentirety.\n\nDear Zelda,\n\nHere's the scenario: when the boss sees co-workers having a quiet conversation, he wants to know what\nis being said (it's mostly work related). He has his designated \"snitches\" and expects them to keep him\napprised of all the office gossip -- even calling them at home and expecting a run-down! This puts the\n\"designees\" in a really awkward position; plus, we're all afraid any offhand comment or anything said\nin confidence might be either repeated or misrepresented.\n\nNeedless to say, this creates a certain amount of tension between team members who normally would\nget along well, and adds stress in an already stressful atmosphere. There is also an unspoken belief that\nhe will move people to different desks to break up what he perceives as people becoming too\n\"chummy.\" (It's been done under the guise of \"creating teams.\")\n\nWe used to be able to joke around a little or talk about our favorite \"Idol\" contestant to break the\ntension, but now we're getting more and more skittish about even the most mundane general\nconversations (\"Did you have a good This was once a very open, cooperative group who\nworked well together. Now we're more suspicious of each other and teamwork is becoming harder. Do\nyou think this was the goal?\n\nSilenced in SID\n\nDear Silenced,\nWow, that takes \"intelligence collection\" in a whole new -- and inappropriate -- direction!\nIt's lonely at the top\n\nFirst let me say that I do not think this manager's intent is to discourage teamwork. What it sounds like\nto me is that he (I'll call him \"Michael\") feels like an outsider and wants to be in the know. It can be\nlonely being the boss. You sit closed off in an office and miss the easy camaraderie with your co-\nworkers, while at the same time feeling the need to \"police\" their behavior. Maybe someone told\nMichael there was too much chit-chat in his organization or that some specific problem existed, and\nresorting to snitches is his misguided way of ferreting out the culprit(s). Either that or he's been\nwatching too much \"Law and Order.\"\n\nWhy don't you try this: go overboard communicating with him. Call him over when he's wandering\naround spying on people and fill him in on things. Give him details of work projects and ask his\n\nopinion about mission matters so he feels like he's 1n the loop.\" Get others to drop by his desk\nperiodically just to say hello, \"hope you had a good weekend,\" or \"How 'bout them I bet that will\n\nsatisfy his need to know what's going on and he'll back off with the nosiness.\nSecrets Allowed\n\nWe work in an Agency of secrets, but this kind of secrecy begets more secrecy and it becomes a\ndownward spiral that destroys teamwork. What if you put an end to all the secrecy by bringing it out\ninto the open? You and your co-workers could ask Michael for a team meeting and lay out the issue as\nyou see it: \"We feel like you don't trust us and we aren't comfortable making small talk anymore for\nfear of having our desks moved if we're seen as being too chummy.\" (Leave out the part about the\nsnitches.) Tell him how this is hampering collaboration and affecting the workproblem with the team's behavior, and see what he says. Encourage him to come directly to the\nemployee in question if he has a concern (rather than ask a third party to gather intel for him). In any\ncase, the meeting will clear the air. Stick to the facts and how you feel, rather than making it about him\n(\"We're uncomfortable\" vs. \"You're spying on \n\nIf, after your attempts to bring things out in the open, it becomes clear that Michael is simply evil\n(some people live to stir up trouble), your best recourse may be to approach Michael's boss with the\nproblem and perhaps Michael can be reassigned. Be sure to focus on the effect it's having on the team's\nwork when you talk to his manager.\n\nNo one likes a tattle-tale\n\n\"Silenced\" implied that in this situation the snitches were unwilling accomplices for Michael. The\nreluctant snitches feel like they're \"damned if they do and damned if they don't,\" and everyone else is\nwalking on eggshells. If you are bothered by snitches in your office, whether of the unwilling or\nvoluntary variety, the best solution is to keep your behavior above reproach. Be a good performer,\nwatch what you say and do, lock your screen when you step away from your workstation, and keep\nfodder for wagging tongues (your Viagra stash, photos of your wild-and-crazy girls' weekend in\nAtlantic City) at home or out of sight. If you are put in the \"unwilling snitch\" position, I would advise\ntelling your boss that you're not comfortable with the role and to please not ask that of you.\n\nTrust is hard to rebuild once it has been broken. Your work center may take time to heal after this\ndeplorable practice is discontinued, but give it time and hopefully the open cooperation you once\n\nenjoyed will return.\n\nzelda\n\nEditor's note: Have thoughts on this topic? Post them on the associated Tapioca Pebble.\n\nStandard disclaimer: \"Zelda's\" views are her own and do not represent the official views of\nthe Associate Directorate for Corporate Leadership, Human Resources, SID, or any other NSA\norganization.\n\n"

    "doc_text": "(U) UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen -- Will the Developed and Developing\nWorld Agree on Climate Change?\n\nFROM:\nDeputy SINIO for Economics and Global Issues (S17)\nRun Date: 12/07/2009\n\n(U) Delegates from around the world will convene in Copenhagen from 7 to 18 December for the\nUN Climate Change Conference (COP-15). The event is intended to be the culmination of two\nyears of negotiations by the international community to reach consensus on legally binding\ncommitments to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would enter into force in 2012, when\nthe ?rst phase of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change expires. Over 90 world leaders, including\nthe US. President, are expected to participate. In Copenhagen, these leaders will attempt to reach\nan agreement that both launches immediate action and ensures long-term commitments. However,\nit remains to be seen if an agreement will be reached or whether negotiations will break down\nentirely. Success or failure will have far-reaching effects in the areas of foreign policy,\nenvironmental issues, and energy security.\n\n(U) Reaching a global climate-change agreement will not be easy for the delegates. The greatest\nchallenge to the talks remains the North-South divide. The leaders from the North -- developed\ncountries -- see climate change as a problem with irreversible consequences that cannot be solved\nwithout the full participation of developing countries, especially emerging market economies. The\nleaders from the South -- or developing countries, led by China and India -- see the climate change\nproblem as not of their making and believe they are being asked to ?x it in ways which will hamper\ntheir ability to raise their standards of living.\n\n(U) These divisions are deep, with both sides showing few signs of compromise. During the\nopening session of preliminary negotiations in Barcelona last month, the 50-member Africa Group,\nin a show of unity, walked out, announcing that they would boycott the Kyoto Protocol talks until\ndeveloped countries got serious about their climate change commitments. They ended their boycott\nof the talks after winning promises for more in-depth talks on how much developed countries need\nto reduce GHG emissions.\n\n(U) To move the process forward, it will be necessary to bridge this divide. There are efforts\nunderway to do this, including the Franco-Brazilian common position, which aims to reduce GHG\nemissions globally by at least 50 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. In a mid-November statement\nto the press, Presidents Sarkozy and Lula emphasized that they hoped to demonstrate that two\ncountries with different national and regional situations can successfully adopt a joint position on\nclimate change. Meanwhile, the Danes, as host of the event, are tirelessly engaging world leaders to\ngarner support for their draft political agreement - which was created when it became clear that the\nprocess had run out of time to reach agreement on a legally binding treaty. Supporters of this\napproach hope the political agreement will subsequently be transformed into a legally binding\nclimate treaty sometime next year.\n\nhere at NSA, as well as our Second Party partners, will continue to provide\npolicymakers with unique, timely, and valuable insights into key countries' preparations and goals\nfor the conference, as well as deliberations within countries on climate change policies and\nnegotiating strategies. A late November report detailed China's efforts to coordinate its position\nwith India and ensure that the two leaders of the developing world are working towards the same\noutcome. Another report provided advance details of the Danish proposal and their efforts to launch\na \"rescue plan\" to save COP-15.\n\nGiven such large participation (with all 192 UN member states invited to attend),\nleaders and negotiating teams from around the world will undoubtedly be engaging in intense last-\nminute policy formulating; at the same time, they will be holding frequent sidebar discussions with\ntheir counterparts -- details of which are of great interest to our policymakers. While the outcome\nof the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference remains uncertain, signals intelligence will\nundoubtedly play a signi?cant role in keeping our negotiators as well informed as possible\nthroughout the 2-week event.\n\n"

The objectives de?ning the scope of this\nresearch activity are:\n\nl) To assess if it is to bene?t to continue research into Whether\npractical-scale QC can be developed Within a reasonable timeframe, to identify its most\npromising physical embodiment(s), and to formulate a credible scenario for its large-scale\ndevelopment;\n\n2) To gain an understanding of the computational capabilities\nof quantum computers; and\n\n3) To identify practical methods that are not susceptible to\nquantum computational attack.\n\nThese guidelines do not cover the possibility of large-scale QC\ndevelopment programs at NSA, but only the research and planning preliminary to, and in\npossible support of, such programs.\n\nMuch of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most\neffectively pursued in NSA-funded open research programs. These programs play a critical role\nas the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the ?eld. However, NSA\nis pursuing more than just basic, unclassi?ed research.

These goals must be pursued at the\nclassi?ed level.\n\nThere are several fundamental reasons for classifying QC research:\n1) To protect efforts to develop QC to attack high-\n\ngrade public key systems by denying adversaries information concerning\nassessment of, and/or plans for, large-scale QC development;\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n2) To enable us to track our adversaries? degree of success or failure in similar\nQC development efforts; and\n\n3) To protect our own systems against adversarial QC efforts.\n\nBased on this, the distinctions between unclassi?ed and classi?ed information\ncontained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassi?ed basic-level, academic-scale\nresearch of scienti?c interest, and more comprehensive classi?ed research which might disclose\ntechniques that may otherwise be possible to protect, or which might imply, or wrongly,\nserious intent on part to pursue large-scale development of quantum\n\ncomputers.\n\n \n\nDescription of Information\n\nClassi?cation/\nMarkings\n\nCategory\n\nDeclass\n\nRemarks\n\n \n\nA.

He was slated to retire last August, but was extended until August\n2013. He will be accompanied by Ms. Christina Malm, FRA. The remainder of\nthe delegation includes:\n\nMs. Lena Nyberg, SIGINT Director, FRA\nMr. Mats Nordqvist, Technical Director, FRA\n\nMr. Strategic Adviser Chief Studies and Development, FRA\nMs. Chief Foreign Relations Of?cer, FRA\nPURPOSE OF THE VISIT:\n\nII T0 USA, SWE) Each year a high-level FRA delegation visits NSAICSS to\nattend the SWEDU SA SPC. Discussions will center on topics of mutual interest and\nfuture areas of collaboration. It also presents an opportunity for NSAICSS leadership to\nreiterate their commitment to the Swedish partnership.\n\nVISITOR REQUESTED:\n\nI USA, SWE) RA requested a (Quantum project) update and\nasked to hear about our plans for sharing reports on Quantum tipping or intercepts from\nthe Quantum tipping. FRA plans to start the conference by giving an overview of its\nSIGINT Roadmap, to include Russia,\n\n. It will also provide a Cyber update--speci?cally\nbrie?ng NSA on its new cyber division, its active and passive sensors and tradecra?\ncollaboration with Threat Operations Center updates on the special\n\nDerived From: NSAICSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 30320108\nTOP \n\nTOP SECRETUCOMINTHNOFORN\n\nproject and and a discussion of how new legislation has helped improve the\nFRA-Swedish Security Service (SAPO) relationship.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP SECRETHCOMINTHNOFORN\n\nGUIDANCE: (U) NIA\n\nPREP SESSION GUIDANCE:\n\na (U) Due to the nature of the visit, no specific guidance has been conveyed to other\nparticipants.\n\nNSAICSS REQUESTED:\n- Further Cyber Securityr'Defense Cooperation;\n- TO USA, SWE) Future CT cooperation (value of CT Deployed Analyst);\n- (SHREL TO USA, SWE) Status of relationship between FRA and SAPO under the new\nlegislation;\n0 TO USA, SWE) Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) Update;\nI (TSUREL TO USA, SWE) Update on Special project;\n\nCYBERCOM REQUESTED: NIA\n\nCOMMON THREADS:\nI TO USA, SWE) Emphasize the value ofthe NSA-FRA partnership.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\nUSA, SWE) Recommend General Alexander and DKDIR emphasize the following\npoints:\n\nQuantum Operations:\n\nII (TSHSIHREL TO USA, SWE) Acknowledge the success that NSA, FRA, and GCHQ\nhave had on WINTERLIGHT. Last month, we received a message from our Swedish\npartner that GCHQ received FRA QUANTUM tips that led to 100 shots, five of which\nwere successfully redirected to the GCHQ server. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)\ncon?rmed with Tailored Access Operations (TAO) that this validates the \"proof of\nconcept\" that was originally trying to be accomplished. Additionally, FAD, TAO, and\nEnterprise Information Technology Services are still working through the technical\nsolution to have FRA tip directly to NSA. S3 Data Acquisitions? goal is to have a\nsolution for a direct tip to RA operational by this summer. The Quantum effort\nmotivated the recent XKEYSCORE installation. RA is currently evaluating it for use to\nsupport their SIGINT Development work.\n\nCable Aecesszeporting and Analysis:\n\nTO USA, SWE) Highlight that would like to continue to\ncollaborate on cable access program, which has resulted in unique SIGINT\nreporting on a variety of high-priority SIGINT topics (123 reports thus far this ?scal\nyear). FRA continues to gain access to more data from additional telecommunications\ncompanies, making the cable access potentially lucrative for for targets beyond\nRussia.\n\nTOP \n\nCyber:\n\nSecure\nI\n\nTOP \n\n(TSIIREL TO USA, SWE) Stress that NTOC is ready to seriously engage with FRA on\ncyber defense. Mr. kesson has reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\n\nand has no changes; therefore, we would like to have an official signing during the\n24 April I 130?1200 discussions.\n\nNTOC shared some information with FRA about a Swedish intrusion in\nNovember 2012. RA came in with questions in February 2013 that led NTOC to do\nmore analysis. Subsequently, NTOC reached the same conclusion as FRA, that it\ninvolved the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. RA asked if it could alert Israel and NTOC\nagreed that it could tell Israel about the intrusion. Israel?s identity was never\ncompromised.\n\nVTC Capability\n\nTO USA, FVEY) Encourage FRA to set up its equipment soonest to allow for\nsecure VTC capability. That capability already exists with Norway and Denmark and has\nshown bene?t in expanding analytic collaboration on a myriad of issues. FRA's\ntechnology directorate is just waiting on requirements from its SIGINT directorate to be\nable to ?nalize the set-up and installation.\n\nCounterterrorism:\n\nTO USA, SWE) Counterterrorism (CT) and FRA\ncontinue to cooperate and collaborate on CT threat-related activities in Europe. Several\nanalyst-to-analyst meetings have taken place and European Center (ECC) in\nDarmstadt, Germany, is formally coordinating a Staff Processing Form (SPF) to have\nSweden assist with high-priority CT Swedish language traf?c that ECC is\ncurrently unable to fully analyze. In January 2013, CT established its first CT deployed\nanalyst position in Stockholm. Also in January, FRA and SAPO were legally allowed to\ncollaborate after a 4-year hiatus.\n\nTO USA, SWE) Encourage increased collaboration on CT threat streams.\n\nRussia:\n\nTO USA, SWE) Thank Sweden for its continued work on the Russian\ntarget, and underscore the primary role that FRA plays as a leading partner to work the\nRussian target, including Russian leadership, energy, and and\ncounterintelligence. cable access has resulted in unique SIGINT reporting on all\nof these areas.\n\nTO USA, SWE) Encourage continued collaboration and sharing of reporting\non Russian topics.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nVISIT FORMAT:\n\n0 TO USA, SWE) GEN Alexander?s opening remarks will set the tone for a\nproductive conference.\n\na (SHREL TO USA, SWE) FRA will provide brie?ngs on SIGINT Roadmap; its\nnew cyber division; its relationship with the Swedish Internal Security Service, \nand updates on the special project and NAPA-3.\n\n0 (UHFOUO) NSA Participants: SID DIR, DIRFA, Associate for CT, GCM, Russia\nProduction Center, GCM, Of?ce of South Asia, GCM, Of?ce of ChinaIKorea, NTOC,\nNCSC, SSO, Special Projects Of?ce (LEGEND).\n\nPREVIOUS VISITS AND RESPECTIVE TOPICS:\n\n0 TO USA, SWE) Mr. Akesson last visited for SWEDUSA in May\n2012.\n\nPOTENTIAL LANDMINES: (U) None.\nOTHER INFORMATION: (U) None.\n\nRECENT PRESS INDICATIONS: (U) None.\n\nTOP \n\n"

Online gaming represents a\ntechnology that is rapidly growing in popularity worldwide. World of Warcraft is\none with an impressive following of gaming enthusiasts. With over 10 million users\nworldwide, WOW may be providing SIGINT targets a way to hide in plain sight. Targets\nhave been spotted receiving ?no reply\" emails from gaming providers and GCHQ\nhave correlated known SIGINT targets to online gaming events. The New\nMission Development Center at MHS, the Global Network Exploitation (OPD-GNE) and\nthe Applied Research Special Topics (B18) organization at GCHQ are working together\n\nTOP TO USA, FVEY\n\nxJ\n\nTD \n\nto filter the survey environment for this traffic and ektract various types of\nWow metadata forelelth development and network knowledge enrichment.\n\nCommunication is at the core of online gaming\nand in Wow there are many ways to\ncommunicate and interact in lhe virtual world. A\nplayer has a character lo and can join different\ngroups. A \"party\" brings players together for a\ncommon, defined purpose or guest. It is\ntemporary and task-oriented. \"Guilds,\" on the\nother hand, are for characters with persisting\nrelationships and can take on an organizational\nstructure with ranks and positions. The guild is\nmore permanent and ideological. Characters can\ncommunicate verbally and non-verbally and may\nset up different types of channels to talk within a\nguild or privately, characterto character.\n\n \n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nrecently asked llee's New lvlission Development Center \nto support an online gaming research effort focusing on Wow. Eager to assist in a new\npotential area of target development, the NileC discussed metadata needs with \nin order to enable Wow target and network research in the arena. The\nNileiC engaged SHORT, an open source packet-sniffing software, which runs on all\nFCRN SAT survey packet data, to filter out Wow packets. provided several\nWow protocol parsing scripts to process the traffic and produce Warcraft metadata from\nall NileC survey. These logs are now being forwarded back to for\nadditional analysis, target development and network knowledge enrichment. By fusing\ninformation from different systems, databases, and resources has correlated\ntarget entities to Wow logon events and continues to uncover potential SICIN value by\nidentifying accounts, characters, and guilds related to Islamic Ektremist Groups, Nuclear\nProliferation and Arms oealing.\n\nWow certainly provides entertainment for a large number of people\nworldwide, but its gaming format can provide a virtual organizational platform for\npotential SIGINT targets as well. Furthermore, this technology can assist the target and\nsimultaneously assist the SIGINT community in tracking that target. The Wow gaming\ninfrastructure provides ample information for network development through the data\npassed during Wow messages, such as country and time zone information, local IP\naddresses and realm server addresses. In terms of active target development, there are\nclear parallels: tradiljonal SIGINT development may follow emails, chat and buddy lists,\nwhereas Wow target development may follow character IDs and logons, gaming\ncommunication channels and guilds.\n\nMHS el?lo will continue to develop and collaborate ol?l this\npotentially lucrative venue.\n\nTD 3\n\n"

    "doc_text": "TOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \nSI) Topic: Exploiting Terrorist Use of Games Virtual Environments\n\nSI) Issue: We know that terrorists use many feature-rich Internet communications media\nfor operational purposes such as email, chat, proxies, and web forums and it is highly\nlikely they will be making wide use of the many communications features offered by Games and\nVirtual Environments (GVE) by 2010. The SIGINT Enterprise needs to begin taking action now\nto plan for collection, processing, presentation, and analysis of these communications. With a\nfew exceptions, NSA can?t even recognize the traf?c, and therefore it is impossible to even say\nwhat percentage of the environment is let alone determine how targets are using the\ncommunications features of GVEs. However, GVES offer a opportunity space\nand more research is needed to figure out effective exploitation.\n\nSI) GVES today allow individuals to gather with like-minded others online. Many GVEs\noffer communications such as private chat (P2P), group chat, chat to an alias, and broadcast chat\n?both text and voice. Also many GVES allow convergent technologies to intermingle such as\nXboxLive! which can be run via an Xbox360 gaming console and/or connect via a PC to normal\nMSN chat. Second Life offers the ability to anonymously text to a GSM phone (SMS) and soon\nthey will offer anonymous voice calls so that phone numbers do not have to be known by either\nparty and won?t show up in collection. Some GVES allow third party interfaces which allow\nlimited functionality from a web browser. This overcomes obstacles such as a high-bandwidth\nrequirement and or not being allowed to download software (think Internet cafe usage). In\naddition, many GVES are able to be used via mobile devices connected wirelessly (phones,\nhandhelds, laptops). Connected to the GVEs, specialized forums and other social networking\nsites have sprung up to provide an additional place to interact, connect, or share. These sites and\nany others can be advertised in the GVEs, so that if a terrorist web forum has to move locations it\ncan be found by its members again. Areas/groups can be access-restricted, member-only. They\nare essentially private meeting places, and can be used for planning, comms, and training, etc.\nGVES are used for collaboration; Forterra?s 3D world is coming to JWICS to do this IC-wide.\n\nGVES have been made that reinforce prejudices and cultural stereotypes while\nimparting a targeted message or lesson both from the Western point of view and in the Middle\nEast. America?s Army is a US. Army produced game that is free download from its recruitment\npage and is acknowledged to be so good at this the army no longer needs to use it for\nrecruitment, they use it for training. The Lebanese Hizballah has taken this concept and the same\nbasic game design and made its own version of the game called Special Forces 2 (SF2), which its\npress section acknowledges is used for recruitment and training in order to prepare their youth to\n?fight the enemy?, a radicalizing medium; the ultimate goal is to become a suicide martyr. One\ncannot discount the ?fun factor? involved it is important to hold your target audience?s\nattention-- and makes ingesting the message not even noticeable. SF2 features multi-player, on-\nline text and voice chat for up to 60 players simultaneously, effectively acting like a VPN or\nprivate chat forum. SF2 is offered at $10 a copy and so also goes to fund terrorist operations.\n\n \n\nSI) These games offer realistic weapons training (what weapon to use against what target,\nwhat ranges can be achieved, even aiming and ?ring), military operations and tactics,\nphotorealistic land navigation and terrain familiarization, and leadership skills. While complete\nmilitary training is best achieved in person, perfection is not always required to accomplish the\nmission. Some of the 9-11 pilots had never ?own a real plane, they had only trained using\nDerived From: 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20320108\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \nMicrosoft?s Flight Simulator. When the mission is expensive, risky, or dangerous, it is often a\nwiser idea to exercise virtually, rather than really blow an operative up assembling a bomb or\nexposing a sleeper agent to law enforcement scrutiny. Militaries around the world use virtual\nsimulators with great success and the Hizballah has even hooked up a Playstation controller to a\nlaptop in order to guide some of its real missiles. Kuma Wars is a US. owned company that\noffers realistic battle simulation of real battles in Iraq usually one month after they actually\nhappened. The player can re-do maneuvers in a lessons learned way for training, or you can\nswitch sides and see how it works from the opposite side. It also provides real terrain features,\nsuch as real road signs from real roads in Iraq, and a simulated night-vision goggles\nenvironment.\n\nSI) Al Qaida terrorist target selectors and GVE executables have been found associated\nwith XboxLive, Second Life, World of Warcraft, and other GVEs in PINWALE network traf?c,\nTAO databases, and in forensic data. Other targets include Chinese hackers, an Iranian nuclear\nscientist, Hizballah, and Hamas members. GCHQ has a vigorous effort to exploit GVEs and has\nproduced exploitation modules in XboxLive! and World of Warcraft. After beta testing, they\nexpect reporting to begin in April 2008. The FBI, CIA and the Defense Humint Service all have\nHUMINT operations in Second Life and other GVEs and are very interested in forming a\ndecon?iction and tipping group that would be able to collaborate on operations.\n\nGVEs are an opportunity! We can use games for: CNE exploits, social network\nanalysis, HUMINT targeting, ID tracking (photos, doc IDs), shaping activities, geo-location of\ntarget, and collection of comms. It has been well documented that terrorists are OPSEC and tech\nsaavy and are only getting more so over time. These applications and their servers however, are\ntrusted by their users and makes an connection to another computer on the Internet, which can\nthen be exploited. Through target buddylists and interaction found in the gaming and on gaming\nweb sites, social networks can be diagramed and previously unknown SIGINT leads and\nconnections and terrorists cells discovered. GVEs can contain on-line presence indicators,\ngeolocation, and ID tracking can be gleaned and used in apprehension operations.\n\nSI) Recommendation: The amount of GVEs in the world is growing but the specific ones\nthat CT needs to be methodically discovered and validated. Only then can we find evidence that\nGVEs are being used for operational uses. Protocol Exploitation, SFL, and TAO should begin\npro?ling their databases and the GVEs for collection and exploitation possibilities. Open source\n(APSTARS) produced GVE lists and selectors should be used to run against UTT and other\ndatabases to check for cross matches to develop target selectors. CT SIGDEV along with CT\nTOPIs will study the collected traf?c to find and track targets of interest. There should be a\nconcentrated effort to conduct research into target use of GVEs, and signatures for survey\ncollection should be developed. Targets and speci?c apps should be chosen to exploit to ensure\nthat terrorists? GVE/social site usage is covered by SIGINT and the system is not left behind the\ntimes. All avenues should be taken to develop PES and CNE exploits as GVEs are found on\ntarget computers. We need to develop a viewer/db that allows to\nview/experience voice/text/video traf?c together and archivee the GVE data associated with\nreporting. which will also be essential for Yahoo, Skype, webcam, VTCs and Biometrics.\n\nSI) CT should establish a process to decon?ict IC-wide ops in GVEs and to\ndevelop strategy for collaboration. Members from at least CIA, FBI, DIA, NSA and GCHQ\nshould participate to make the coordination signi?cant. Members should have ability to check\ntasking, traf?c, and status of current operations.\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, \n\n"

FVEY) NSA's relationship with the Swedish SIGINT service,\nForsvarets Radioanstalt (F RA). was established in 1954 under the UKUSA agreement.\nAt that time it was agreed that GCHQ would take the lead for the exchange of COMINT\ninformation and that NSA would take the lead for the ELINT exchange. As of April\n2004, NSA. GCHQ and the FRA agreed to dissolve this part of the UKUSA agreement\nand hold bilateral exchanges on both COMINT and ELINT.\n\nF) NSA's relationship with the FRA. an extremely competent. technically\ninnovative. and trusted Third Party partner. continues to grow. The RA provided NSA\nwith access to its cable collection in 2011. providing unique collection on high-priority\nRussian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy.\n\n. efforts against counter-terrorism (CT) targets continue to expand. and\nnew legislation enacted in January 2013 has improved its ability to work directly with the\nSwedish internal security service (SAPO). Data Acquisition is actively engaged\nwith the FRA. which has numerous collection sites and is pro?cient in coilecting a wide\nvariety of communications.\n\n(U) Key Issues\n\n(TSNSINNF) The FRA continues to place more emphasis on cyber. NSA's National\nThreat Operations Center (NTOC) and FRA have an ongoing exchange\ndiscussing malware topics. The FRA is positioning itself to become the cyber defense\nauthority in Sweden and hopes to receive the Swedish government mandate in the near\nfuture.\n\nDerived From: NSAICSSM 1'52\nDated; 20070108\nDeclassity 0n 20320108\nTOP SECRETHCOMINTHNOFORN\n\nTOP SECRETIICOMINTIINOFORN\n\n(U) What NSA Provides to Partner\n\n(SNREL TO USA.

On the GS\nagenda are international development (health, food security, natural resources trade, and climate\n\nchange); and peace and security (nonproliferation and AfghanistanmPakistan).\n\n(U) The G20 Summit is to focus on implementing the September 2009 Pittsburgh G20 Summit's\nframework for strong and balanced world economic growth. Also on the agenda are international\n?nancial institutions reform and re-?nanoing, ?nancial sector regulatory reform, and countering\n\ntrade protectionism.\n\n\n\nfr\" ti\n\nSummit Venues (U)\n\n(U) The G8 Summit will be held on 25 and 26 June in Huntsville, in Ontario's Muskoka Region.\n\n(The GS Summit venue is also called Muskoka.) The GZG Summit will be held\nJune in Toronto, Ontario -- about 140 miles sooth of Huntsville.

Our customers and\nstakeholders can rely on us to provide timely, high quality products and services, because we never stop\ninnovating and improving, and we nevergive up!\n\n(U) The Environment\n\n(U FOUO) For decades, Signals Intelligence has sustained deep and persistent access to all manner of\nadversaries to inform and guide the actions and decisions of Presidents, military commanders, policy\nmakers and clandestine service officers. As the world has changed, and global interdependence and the\nadvent of the information age have transformed the nature of our target space, we have adapted in\ninnovative and creative ways that have led some to describe the current day as ?the golden age of\n\n\n(U FOUO) That reputation was hard-won, but will only endure if we keep sight of the dynamic and\nincreasingly market driven forces that continue to shape the SIGINT battle space. We must proactively\nposition ourselves to dominate that environment across discovery, access, exploitation, analysis,\ncollaboration and in the products and services we provide. The SIGINT system and our interaction\ntherein must be as agile and dynamic as the information space we confront.\n\n(U FOUO) The mission space for SIGINT in the years ahead will continue to grow at a rapid pace\namidst a dramatically new set of challenges:\n\n(U FOUO) The interpretation and guidelines for applying our authorities, and in some cases the\nauthorities themselves, have not kept pace with the complexity of the technology and target\nenvironments, or the operational expectations levied on mission.\n\n- (U) Digital information created since 2006 grew tenfold, reaching 1.8 exabytes in 2011, a trend\nprojected to continue; ubiquitous computing is fundamentally changing how people interact as\nindividuals become untethered from information sources and their communications tools; and the\ntraces individuals leave when they interact with the global network will define the capacity to locate,\ncharacterize and understand entitiesl.\n\n \n\n1 (U) Center for the Study of Intelligence (2010) Where Tomorrow Will Take Us: The New Environment for Intelligence. August 2010\n\n2\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\nTOP TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n- (U) Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming U.S. advantages\nin conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneously and exceedingly hard to\ntrace. Such attacks may not cause the mass casualties of a nuclear strike, but they could paralyze US.\nsociety all the samez.\n\n- (U) The international system as constructed following the Second World War will be almost\nunrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers, a globalizing economy, an historic\ntransfer of relative wealth and economic power from West to East, and the growing in?uence of\nnon-state actors3.\n\n(U) Expectations\n\n(U FOUO) The power of information, its short shelf life in the information age and the speed at which\nit moves will set the conditions for how NSA interacts with customers. Transactional, passive or linear\nrelationships will be replaced by embedded, deeply interactive engagements. Existing investments in\ncyber security will by necessity expand across the enterprise to meet the demand and speed of action\nrequired to thwart our adversaries. To remain a value for the warfighter our information must be\nimmediately available at the lowest classification level. The nation will continue to depend upon NSA to\nbe the lead for the application of the science of sustaining access and understanding of\ndata even as becomes automatic, transparent and prolific. Products and services from NSA\nwill evolve into forms and across boundaries that mirror the networked and agile manner in which\npeople interact in the information age, and we will share information, responsibly and securely, with\nexternal partners and customers.\n\nFor SIGINT to be optimally effective, legal, policy, and process authorities must be as\nadaptive and dynamic as the technological and operational advances we seek to exploit. Nevertheless,\nthe culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary\nauthorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue\nlegal authorities and a policy framework mapped more fully to the information age.\n\n(U FOUO) To sustain current mission relevance and to meet the challenges, the Signals Intelligence\nDirectorate must undertake a profound and revolutionary shift from the mission approach which has\nserved us so well in the decades preceding the onset ofthe information age to a SIGINT system that is\nas agile and dynamic as the information space we confront. The environment demands it, the capability\nof the SIGINT system can achieve it and the work force has the creativity and the skill base to make it\npossible.\n\nWhat follow are the five challenge goals the SIGINT leadership has established to close gaps\nbetween the environment and expectations over the next five years.\n\n \n\nLynn, William (2010).

The purpose of the\ntool is to fundamentally shift the manner in which GAO describes its collection posture. BOUNDLESSINF ORMAN \nprovides the ability to dynamically describe GAO's collection capabilities (through metadata record counts) with no human\nintervention and graphically display the information in a map view, bar chart, or simple table. Prior to\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT, the method for understanding the collection capabilities of GAO's assets involved ad hoc\nsurveying of repositories, sites, developers, and/or programs and of?ces. By extracting information from every DNI and DNR\nmetadata record, the tool is able to create a near real-time snapshot of collection capability at any given moment. The\ntool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collection against that\ncountry. The tool also allows users to view high level metrics by organization and then drill down to a more actionable level -\ndown to the program and cover term.\n\nSample Use Cases\nHow many records are collected for an organizational unit g. \n\nHow many records (and what type) are collected against a particular country?\nAre there any visible trends for the collection?\nWhat assets collect against a speci?c country? What type of collection?\n\nWhat is the ?eld of View for a speci?c site? What countriees does it collect against? What type of\ncollection?\n\n(U) Who are the intended users of the tool?\n\n0 Mission and collection managers seeking to understand output characteristics of a site based on what is being\ningested into repositories.\n\n0 Strategic Managers seeking to understand top level metrics at the organization/of?ce level or seeking to\nanswer data calls on NSA collection capability.\n\nlooking for additional sites to task for coverage of a particular technology within a speci?c country.\n\nWhat are the different views?\n\nMap View The Map View is designed to allow users to view overall DNI, DNR, or aggregated collection\nposture of the agency or a site. Clicking on a country will show the collection posture (record counts, type of collection, and\ncontributing SIGADs or sites) against that particular country in addition to providing a graphical display of record count\n\nPage 1 of 3\nOFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\n \n\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT Frequenth Asked Questions\n\n4)\n\n5)\n\n6)\n\n7)\n\n8)\n\nOFFICIAL USE ONLY\n09-06-2012\n\ntrends. In order to bin the records into a country, a normalized phone number (DNR) or an administrative region atom (DNI)\nmust be populated within the record. Clicking on a site (within the Site Speci?c view) will show the viewshed for that site \nwhat countries the site collects against.\n\nOrg View The Organization View is designed to allow users to View the metadata record counts by\norganizational structure GAO SSO RAM-A SPINNERET) all the way down to the cover term. Since it?s not\nnecessary to have a normalized number or administrative region populated, the numbers in the Org View will be higher than\nthe numbers in the Map View.\n\nSimilarity View The Similarity View is currently a placeholder view for an upcoming feature that will\ngraphically display sites that are similar in nature. This can be used to identify areas for a de-duplication effort or to inform\nof additional SIGADs to task for queries (similar to Amazon?s ?if you like this item, you?ll also like these? feature).\n\n(U) Where do you get your data?\n\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT extracts metadata records from GM-PLACE (DNI ingest processor)\nand (DNR ingest processor). The records are enriched with organization information g. SSO,\nFORNSAT) and cover term. Every valid DNI and DNR metadata record is aggregated to provide a count at the appropriate\nlevel. See the different views question above for additional information.\n\n(U) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?\n\n0 The tool resides on GM-PLACE which is only accredited up to Therefore, the tool\ndoes not contain ECI or FISA data.\n\n0 The Map View only shows counts for records with a valid normalized number (DNR) or administrative\nregion atom (DNI).\n\nOnly metadata records that are sent back to through FASCIA or FALLOUT are counted.\nTherefore, programs with a distributed data distribution system g. MUSCULAR and Terrestrial RF) are not\ncurrently counted.\n\n0 Only SIGINT records are currently counted. There are no ELINT or other records included.\n\n(U) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?\n\n\n\n(U) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?\n\nThe tool currently makes no distinction between sustained collect and survey collect. This feature is on the\nroadmap.\n\nWhat is the technical architecture for the tool?\n\nClick for a graphical view of the tool?s architecture\nDNI metadata (ASDF), DNR metadata (FASCIA) delivered to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)\non GM-PLACE\n\n0 Use Java MapReduce job to transform/?lter and enrich data with business logic to\nassign organization rules to data\n\n0 Bulk import of data (serialized Google Protobuf objects) into Cloudbase (enabled by custom\naggre gators)\n\n0 Use Java web app (hosted via Tomcat) on MachineShop (formerly TurkeyTower) to query Cloudbase\n\n0 GUI triggers queries to CloudBase GXT \n\n9) What are some upcoming features/enhancements?\n\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT FAQ\n\nPage 2 of 3\nUNCLAS OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nUN OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT Frequently Asked Questions 09?06-2912\n\nAdd technology type (6. g.

This access has been critical to efforts to disrupt and contain the operational\ncapabilitics of terrorists in our region as highlighted by the recent arrest of fugitive Bali\nbomber Umar Patch.\n\nWe would very much welcome the opportunity to estend that partnership with NSA to cover\nthe increasing number of Australians involved in international estretnist activities in\nparticular Australians involved with AQAP.\n\n"

Numerous 52 have complained of its existence, and the relatively\nsmall intelligence value it contains does not justify the sheer volume of collection at MUSCULAR (1/4th of the total daily collect).\n\nBackground: Since July of 2012, Yahoo has been transferring entire email accounts using the Narchive data format (a proprietary\nformat for which NSA had to develop custom demultiplexers). To date, we are unsure why these accounts are being transferred \nmovement of individuals, backup of data from overseas servers to US servers, or some other reason. There is no way currently to\npredict if an account will be transferred via Yahoo Narchive.\n\nCurrently, Narchive traffic is collected and forwarded to NSA for memorialization in any quantity only from DS-2008. On any given\nday, Narchive traffic represents 25% (15GB) of daily PINWALE content allocation (60GB currently). DS-2008 is scheduled\nto be upgraded in the summer of 2013; it is likely that memorialized Narchive traffic, if still present in the environment, will grow\nproportionally double now, to 30 GB/day).\n\nNarchive traffic is mailbox formatted email, meaning unlike Yahoo webmail, any attachments present would be collected as part of\nthe message. This is a distinct advantage. However, it has not been determined what causes an Narchive transfer of an account, so\nthese messages are rarely collected \"live\".\n\n \n\nBased on analysis of Narchive email data and_, we were able to indentify statistics for the original\ncommunications date for Narchive email messages collected:\n\n30 days 1118 11%\n30 days, 90 days 1758 17%\n90 days 180 days 1302 13%\n180 days, 1 year 2592 26%\n1years, 5 years 3084 31%\n5years 154 \n\nNumerous target offices have complained about this collection \"diluting\" their workflow. One argument for keeping it is that it\nprovides a retrospective look at target activity this argument is hampered by a) the unreliable and non-understood nature of when\nthe transfer occurs for an account, and b) that FISA restrospective collection would retrieve the exact same data \"on demand?.\n\nSSO Optimization believes that while this is \"valid\" collection of content, the sheer volume and the age coupled with the\nunpredictable nature of Narchive activity makes collecting older data a less desirable use of valuable resources. 59% of Narchive\nemail collected was originally sent and received more than 180 days after collection. This represents about 8.9 GB a day of \"less\ndesirable? collection long term allocation that could be easily filled with more timely, useful from this lucrative 550 site. As\nalways with our optimization, the data would still be available at the site store for SIGDEV. This would not impact metadata\nextraction.\n\nPast DO volume reduction efforts:\nWebmail OAB- Leap day 2012: the original defeat only targeted gmail, yahoo, and hotmail webmail protocol\nFB buddylist sampling since last year\n\nToday: FB OAB this is a JSON addressbook\n\n"

During a January 2013 visit= unbeknownst to FAD\nDesk Officers and SUSLAF, DGSE and ANSSI questioned DIRNSA about the cyber\nattacks and asked about S. involvement DIRNSA denied US involvement and offered\nNSA's assistance to France in attributing the attacks. Two (2) SS Threat\nOperations Center (NTOC) were prepared to travel to Paris in March to provide\nsupport to the French; DGSE and ANSSI canceled the meeting the day before the team\nwas scheduled to depart and instead. requested a visit to NSA on 12 April. For this visit.\nMr. Barbier and Mr. Pailloux will be accompanied b_v:\n\n. . . . 51?\"\n\n \n\n(U) PURPOSE OF THE VISIT:\n\n0 SI NF) Mr. Barbier and Mr. Pailloux will present technical details of the cyber\nattacks against the French Presidential network from May 2012 Mr Barbier and Mr\nPailloux will meet with senior leaders and from NTOC: SID: IAD: and FAD in\n\nhopes that NSA can help with attribution\n(U) VISITOR REQUESTED:\n\n0 (S REL TO USA, FRA) DGSE and ANSSI requests help in attributing the cyber attacks\nagainst the French Presidential network in May 2012\n\n(U) GUIDANCE \n(U) PREP GUIDANCE:\n\n0 SI NF) Prep sessions are scheduled for DIRXSA and DIR on 12 April.

NTOC DIR, IA DIR, SID\nDIR, SUSLAF, FAD Desk O?ices, and tedmical Target expats.\n\n(U) PREVIOUS VISITS AND RESPECTIVE TOPICS:\n\n0 REL USA, FRA) Mr. Barbie last visited NSA in May 2012 for the Strategic\nPlanning Conference. Mr. Pailloux last visited NSA in February 2011; this visit focused\non cybe issues.\n\n(U) POTENTIAL LANDMINES:\n\n0 There is a chance that helping attribute the cybe attacks against the French\nPresidential network may reveal a US. ally is responsible.\n\n0 The French have not been forthcoming in sharing technical details of the\ncyber attacks. Thee is suspicion that the information is not being shared prior to the visit\nbecause the French want to see how NSA responds when they present their ?ndings.\nDuring the January 2013 DIRNSA visit to Paris, both DGSE and ANSSI asked GEN\nAlexander about the cybe attacks in an attempt to ascertain whether or not the US. was\nresponsible for the attacks (as reported in Frerch magazines). At no time was FAD made\naware that DGSE and AN 881 intended to raise the issue with DIRNSA.\n\n(U) OTHER INFORMATION:\n\n0 TAO con?rmed that this was not a TAO operation. TAO asked most of\nclose Party Partners whethe they wee involved (CIA, GCHQ, and CSEC\nwere the mostly likely suspects); everyone has denied involvement. TAO intentionally\n\nTOP SEC \n\nTOP SEC \ndid not ask e'the Mossad or ISNU whethe they wee involved as France is not an\napproved target for joint discussion.\n\nAfter repeated requests for technical information relating to the cybe attacks (in\nadvance of the visit), ANSSI and DGSE have not provided any details.\n\n(U) RECENT PRESS INDICATIONS:\n\n(U) The cyber attacks against the French Presidential network took place in May 2012.\nAn initial press report from Paris Atlantico, ?French Web site says Turkish Hackers\nBdiind Elvsee C?e Attacks.\" dated 12 July 2012, stated it was believed ?the attacks\noriginated from France's allies\" and speculated Turkish hackes with possible links to\nTurkish ?intelligence services or government bodies\" might be responsible. No follow-on\npress reports have been seen that place blame on Turkey. A press report from Paris\n\n1. Express, ?French Weeklv on Alleged US Cybe Espionage Attack on Elvsee\nPalace.\" dated 20 November 2012. shifted blame for the attacks toward the United States.\n\nOn 27 Novembe 2012, @rrct sur images contacted the Paris I. author who\nshared thee are an ?array of assumptions? that enable pointing to the United States as the\norigin of this attack. Pan's Express contacted ANSSI and the Elysee; both declined to\ncomment.\n\nTOP \n\n"

Carried out as Op MULLENIZE, this\noperation is beginning to yield positive results, particularly in . User Agent Staining is\na technique that involves writing a unique marker (or stain) onto a target machine. Each stain is visible in\npassively collected SIGINT and is stamped into every packet, which enables all the events from that stained\nmachine to be brought back together to recreate a brow sing session.\n\nMuch of the work in CT operations involves understanding extremists? use of the Internet. Generally, this\nis achieved by looking through passively collected SIGINT data and using that information to recreate an\nInternet session, based on what was happening on a particular IP address at a particular time.\n\nThe location of collection assets or the telecoms infrastructure of some countries means that the IP address\nseen attached to each event collected might not be the one actually used by the target to access the Internet.\nThese IP addresses might be servers, proxies or NATs (Network Address Translators the Internet?facing\ndevice in a private network of machines) and they can play havoc with the ability to recreate an internet\nsession for an individual.\n\nexample of a region using massive NATs, with thousands of users on one IP address at\nany one time making it virtually impossible to identify our targets in that country. The idea of large scale\nstaining of machines seemed to present a solution to this problem.\n\nIn order to deploy these stains at scale across machines used by the extremist community\n\ndecided to target machines where the users visited extremist web forums\n\nused to deliver the stains to each target machine. mechanism that leverages \nhuge passive SIGINT accesses to deliver CNE payloads to targets. As this is a very new approach to\ntackling a tough target, it took 12 months for policy, collection, processing and CNE issues to be resolved,\nbut after a lot of hard work by some committed individuals across Benhall, Bude and SOUNDER,\nsuccessful implementation of staining at scale was achieved.\n\nOver 150 stains are now deployed against machines the technique has been adopted to help\nwith work agains with nearly 200 stains deployed there in the last 2 months. Analysis\nis becoming easier and the benefits are being felt outside of the teams that started the work. An unexpected\nbenefit from this work is that targeting any of the machines that have been stained for further CNE efforts\nis much easier.\n\nThis is a great example of CNE effects enabling passive SIGINT and then this in turn enabling CNE and\nwill hopefully lead the way for future joint projects on hard targets.\n\nIf you would like to hear more about the techniques and tools used in Op MULLENIZE sign up for a\nMission News Live presentation on Tuesday, 16 October.\n\n \n\n"

Its creators use a special jargon\nto describe its workings; please consult appendix A, Tor glossary, for de?nitions. Tor?s\nanonymization works by having a Tor client send its traf?c through a circuit of three\nservers, each running Tor, under several layers of This accomplishes several\nthings. Most basically, the Tor servers, many of which are listed on publicly advertised\ndirectory servers, are chosen to act as a series of proxies. This may seem to be excessively\ncomplex, as a single proxy server can be used to hide one?s location, but a single?hop proxy\nis vulnerable in two ways. First, by analyzing the pattern of the traf?c going to and from\nthe proxy server, it is possible to deduce which clients are making which requests. Second,\nif an attacker owns the proxy server, then it certainly knows who is asking for what, and\nanonymization is ruined. By using multiple hops, Tor is much more resistant to both of\nthese attacks. Traf?c analysis becomes extraordinarily dif?cult, as it must be coordinated\nacross several machines, and an attacker must own all the hops along the circuit in order\nto trace requests back to the originating client.\n\n(U) If Tor?s only feature was the use multiple proxies, it would not necessarily mean\nthat it could not be attacked some way, such as knowing which circuit a client will choose to\nroute traf?c through, or simply reading requests sent in the clear and looking for identifying\ninformation. However, Tor leverages the libraries to the\ndata it sends and to choose random circuits in order to prevent an attacker from gaining\nuseful information.\n\n(U) The series of Tor servers used to relay a client?s TCP traf?c is referred to as a\ncircuit. Circuits are set up one server at a time in a way that keeps any single server from\nknowing the entire layout of the circuit. The client connects to the ?rst server. It then\nasks the ?rst server to connect to the second server. Finally, it sends a request through\nthe ?rst server that asks the second server connect to the third server. Each server only\nknows who connected to it and to whom it connected, which is just one server each way\nin the circuit. A more detailed explanation can be found in appendix B.1.\n\n(U) The phrase ?onion routing? refers to the way that is layered to hide\ninformation sent down the circuit. When setting up the circuit, the client negotiates keys\nwith each of the servers it will be routing through. Most circuits in Tor contain three\nservers, so the client negotiates three secret keys, one with each server. When the client\nwants to send some data, for example an HTTP GET request, it ?rst the data\nonce using each key. It sends the packet to the ?rst server, which removes one layer of\nand passes along the packet to the second server. The second server removes\nanother layer of and sends the packet to the third server. When the third server\nremoves a layer of then the packet is now in the clear, and the server will send\nthe HTTP GET to the appropriate destination. In this way, only the third server can see\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nwhat the client is sending, and to anyone outside of the Tor cloud it appears that the third\nnode originated the request.\n\n(U) In short, Tor uses a combination of and multiple proxies to hide who\nis sending what through the Tor cloud.\n\n2 Objectives\n1. (U FOUO) Become familiar with Tor by setting up an internal Tor network.\n\n2. Read the documentation and code of, as well as examine the packets\nsent and received by, the client.\n\n3. (S SI) Develop detailed client speci?cations and requirements and document them\nfor the community.\n\n4. (S SI) Create Tor client libraries to be leveraged by a network?enabled application.\n\n5. (S SI) Create a Tor client, using the above Tor libraries, that allows for on?the?fly\ntweaking of the client?s behavior in the Tor cloud.\n\nWe feel that we accomplished all of these objectives, as well as a few\nother unspeci?ed goals. This paper discusses our progress on all of these objectives.\n\n3 Objectives our own internal Tor network on eight machines in the Protocol Ex?\nploitation lab. The network consisted of two directory servers, ?ve servers, and 1 machine\nthat was con?gured to act only as a client. They were connected to each other through\nthe same hub, and we used Ethereal to sniff packets that they sent back and forth.\n\nTor is a large open?source project, and we were able to download its\nsource code and documentation from tor.eff.org. Most of our analysis was performed using\nsource code from Tor versions 0.1.1.17 and 0.1.1.21. There were no major differences\nbetween the two versions, and the core functionality of building circuits and maintaining\ninter?server connections remained unchanged.\n\n(U FOUO) Our analysis was three?fold: we read the protocol speci?cation, exam?\nined the source code, and observed the actual behavior of our own Tor cloud. This gave\nus an excellent idea of how Tor works, allowing us to formulate hypotheses regarding Tor?s\nbehavior which we could then immediately test.\n\n4 (U MJOLNIR\n\n(TS SI) Another major objective was the speci?cation and development of a custom Tor\nclient library. We developed a library that allows the programmer control over all aspects\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nof building a circuit and sending data. Our library is as portable as Tor itself, and we have\nsuccessfully compiled and tested it on both Windows and Linux. We named the library\nMJOLNIR, which is the name of Thor?s hammer from Norse mythology.\n\n(TS SI) MJOLNIR is a modi?cation of Tor, and it is ideally indistinguishable from\nan original Tor client. As such, it should appear identical to Tor in traf?c. To ease this\nprocess, we used original Tor functions whenever possible. However, its main purpose is\nto provide the programmer with greater control over all aspects of Tor. In the normal Tor\nclient, almost all servers in all circuits chosen randomly. Using MJOLNIR, the programmer\ncan build circuits one server at a time, with no limit to the number of servers in the circuit.\nThen the programmer can send an arbitrary TCP payload across the circuit that he built\nand process the response however he wishes.\n\nSI) All of most important calls (in setting up a circuit as well\nas sending data) are blocking. This is because the Tor code is inextricably linked with\nlibevent, an open?source library that allows the user to set up signals that can be handled\nwhenever they are needed. Whereas Tor uses events and a function called once per second\nto perform all its necessary checks and corrections, MJOLNIR uses libevent internally so\nthat each function does what it should do before returning control to the calling program.\nIt would be unfair to any programmer to require that any program using MJOLNIR should\nalso be forced to use libevent at the same level that Tor does. We felt that having blocking\ncalls was the lesser of two evils in this situation, as only programs that follow Tor?s structure\ncould possibly ?nd libevent a Viable way of controlling program flow. solution\nof using libevent internally does make the program slower, but allows the programmer to\nknow whether all of his requests succeed or fail immediately upon return to his program.\n\n4.1 Building circuits\n\n(TS SI) The most fundamental portion of MJOLNIR is its capability to build arbitrary\ncircuits of any length. Using our library, a programmer can build a circuit, use it for some\ntraf?c, then extend it and continue using it. Like Tor, MJOLNIR allows multiple circuits\nto be active at one time, and the user can send traf?c along any of them.\n\n(TS SI) In order to build a circuit, the client must have information about some\nof the servers in the Tor cloud. This information is kept on the directory servers and\ntheir mirrors, and to get this information the client must request it speci?cally from the\ndirectory. MJOLNIR provides a function, update_router_descriptors, which automates\nthis process. Once MJOLNIR has the directory, it can build circuits to any of the servers\nthat it knows about. Servers that have middleman?only exit policies are still allowed to\nbe at the end of the circuit as it is being built. However, should the calling program want\ndata to travel across the circuit, it must be using an exit node that will allow traf?c to\nexit to where the program wants it to go, or MJOLNIR will refuse to send the traf?c in\nthe ?rst place.\n\nIn order to build a circuit, the programmer must begin with a call to\nfunction which returns a new cir-\ncuit_t structure with the given server as its ?rst node. MJOLNIR also provides a set\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nof functions that will append another server to a given circuit. There is also a function\nthat will return a random circuit of a given length, which is provided both in order to\nretain some of Tor?s original functionality and to ease the process of constructing a circuit.\nMJOLNIR is designed to provide as much ?exibility as possible, providing the programmer\nwith a wide array of options for building and extending circuits.\n\nSI) In an effort to provide a robust suite of functions, MJOLNIR provides\nerror?checking at many different levels of circuit construction. Tor servers will fail when\nasked to connect to themselves, but that error will not become apparent until data is\nsent across the circuit. To avoid this problem, MJOLNIR will watch what servers are\nadded to the circuit, and it will refuse to add a server if it is currently at the end of the\ncircuit. In this case, the circuit is not destroyed, but there is at least one situation in\nwhich attempting to add a circuit will result in the destruction of the entire circuit. If the\nprogram attempts to connect to a server that has gone down since being added, then the\ncircuit will be destroyed. This is initiated by the end of the circuit rather than the client,\nso we have no control over it. The calling program should always check return values to\nensure that circuit constructions and extensions were successful.\n\n4.2 (U FOUO) Sending and receiving data\n\n(TS SI) MJOLNIR would not be useful if it could not communicate with other computers.\nFortunately, Tor makes it easy for MJOLNIR to send and receive data without relying on\nan outside program. To send data, MJOLNIR must have three things: a message, a\ndestination, and a circuit across which to send the message. Presumably, the ?rst two\nare application dependent, while the circuit is easy enough to build using \nfunctions. Once a circuit is built and a message is ready to be sent, the programmer needs\nto call send_payload_down_circ with the correct arguments, and the message should get\nto the destination. Each new payload creates a new application proxy (AP) connection,\nwhich is only used internally. Normally, outside applications a web browser) send\ntheir messages across Tor using AP connections. Instead of creating AP connections when\nit gets a request from another program, MJOLNIR creates an AP connection when it has\nsomething to send across a circuit.\n\n(TS SI) Before the message is sent, MJOLNIR sets up libevent events so that it can\nsuccessfully read and write across that connection. It uses the write event immediately\nwhen it sends a payload. It must still listen for a response before returning control to the\ncalling program. In order to provide a reasonable amount of time to receive a response,\nMJOLNIR uses a timeout scheme modeled on TCP timeouts. If MJOLNIR does not\nreceive a response before the timeout runs down, then it will shut down the connections\nit is waiting on and return to the calling program.\n\n(TS SI) Theoretically, there should be a way to shut down connections more ele?\ngantly than using timeouts. For example, consider if MJOLNIR shut down a connection\nwhen it received a cell that was less than the maximum length. Initially, this seems like a\ngood idea because Tor servers should minimize the number of packets they send by send?\ning maximal?length payloads whenever possible. However, upon inspection of the packets,\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: The basic GUI window showing (clockwise from top left)\ncircuits, available servers, and circuit contents.\n\nservers do not always send maximal?length cells, so this method does not work. Also, as\nfar as Tor is concerned, there is no difference between a cell at the beginning of a message\nand a cell at the end, so there is no easy way to know that a message is complete without\nparsing the payload.\n\n(TS SI) Once MJOLNIR receives a cell, it calls a user?set function,\npayload_read_handler. This is a pointer to a function that takes a string (the pay?\nload) and its length. Unfortunately, due to the problems described above, there is no way\nto handle an entire response if it comes in more than one cell; each cell is handled individ?\nually. However, by setting this variable (see the API in the appendix), the calling program\ncan do any operation on the incoming cells, thereby parsing out any necessary data. The\n?exibility afforded by this arrangement is largely what makes communication\ncapabilities so useful.\n\n4.3 MJOLNIR GUI for Windows\n\nSI) In addition to porting the MJOLNIR library to Windows in a dynamic link\nlibrary (DLL), we created a graphical user interface (GUI) to implement a custom Tor\nclient for Windows.\n\n(TS SI) In its current state, the Windows version of MJOLNIR has the following\ncapabilities:\n\n0 Creating new circuits.\n0 Appending a node to an already existing circuit.\n\n0 Creating random circuits of arbitrary length.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n0 Performing ?coil? and ??ower? attacks on servers.\n0 Appending ?coils? and ??owers? to existing circuits.\n\n0 Sending arbitrary packets through a circuit.\n\nSee appendix for detailed information on the Windows version of\nMJOLNIR.\n\n5 Tor?s X.509 certi?cates\n\n(S SI) The only part of a normal Tor interaction that does not take place under TLS\nis the TLS handshake, which has to be done in the clear. We chose to focus on\nthis traf?c to see if there was any way to identify Tor traf?c, since all traf?c under TLS\nlooks the same.\n\n(U) Tor creates two X.509 certi?cates shortly after starting up, in the function\ntor_tls_context_new. The ?rst certi?cate contains a short?term connection key, and\nis signed by the machine?s public RSA key (its identity key). The second is a self?signed\ncerti?cate containing the identity key.\n\n(U) A typical Tor X.509 certi?cate is shown in table 1.\n\nSI) The string appears in the organizationName of both the subject\nand issuer portions of the X509 certi?cates. This means that we see this string in the\nclear during the TLS handshake. By also taking advantage of the ASN.1 encoding that\nsurrounds the string in the certi?cate, we were able to ?nd a byte sequence that appears\nin every Tor TLS handshake. This makes collection easy, as we simply look for the byte\nsequence in traf?c. See table 2 for the sequences.\n\n5.1 X.509 certi?cates\n\nSI) When a Tor server receives a certi?cate, it will verify that its peer sent it a\ncerti?cate with all of the required ?elds for X.509 certi?cates and that its subject?s com?\nmonName ?eld exists and is alphanumeric. Tor servers will not reject a certi?cate with a\nperiod in them, but they will generate a log message to the effect that someone who is not\nusing Tor is trying to connect to the machine. It does not check that the organizationName\nfor either subject or issuer is and it does not check to see that the ?<identity>?\nstring is ever present. Because of this, MJOLNIR can easily send a certi?cate with false\nor random information and still connect to the Tor cloud.\n\n(TS SI) To send a falsi?ed certi?cate, MJOLNIR just needs an array of ?eld value\npairs, where the ?eld is the ?eld name of the X509 certi?cate commonName, 07??\ngam?zatz?onName, and the value is the corresponding value of the ?eld \n?mjolnir?, ?pantheon.se?, As long as the ?eld/value pair is valid, MJOLNIR will\nput it into the certi?cate, so that anyone watching traf?c will not immediately realize that\nthe traf?c from a machine using MJOLNIR is Tor traf?c.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nTable 1: (U) Tor?s X.509 certi?cate\n\nVersion: 3 (0x2) This is hard?coded into Tor.\n\nSerial Number: some number Currently, we don?t know if this is a random\nnumber, or if there is some signi?cance. (We do know that it is created with an\nfunction.)\n\nSignatureAlgorithm: \n\nIssuer: CN=string <identity> will always be present as the\norganizationName. The commonName ?eld is more variable. string will be the nick?\nname of the server as listed in the public directories. For clients without nicknames,\nit will be the string ?client?. Note that it will always be followed by <identity>?.\n\nValidity:\nNot Before: time This is the time that the TLS certi?cate was created by\nTOR.\nNot After: time By default, this is 2 hours later.\nSubject: CN=string Again, is the organizationName. This\nis hard?coded, and will always be present. string will be just the nickname of the\n\nserver in the ?rst certi?cate, and will contain <identity>? in the second, self?signed\ncerti?cate.\n\nSubject Public Key Info:\n\nPublic Key Algorithm: \n- RSA Public Key:\n- Modulus (1024-bit): some number Varies.\n- Exponent: 65537(0x10001) This is hard coded into Tor.\n\nSignature Algorithm: This is followed by 1024 bits\nof signature.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n0 Byte sequence found in all Tor X.509 certi?catesByte sequence found in X.509 certi?cates of clients with default settingsThis corresponds roughly to the part of the certi?cate that says organization?\nand commonName=client <identity>.\n\nTable 2: (S SI) Tor byte sequences\n\n(TS SI) If the programmer does not provide MJOLNIR with the subject?s common?\nName, then it will randomly generate (using OpenSSL?s random byte generator) a legal\ncommonName between 10 and 21 bytes long. This ensures that even if the programmer\n\nforgets to give a certi?cate to the program, there will be no identifying information in the\nTLS handshake.\n\n6 (U) Tor?s hidden services\n\n(U) Tor allows machines to offer a TCP service without revealing their IP address, using\nthe same anonymization techniques as clients connected to the network. Such services\ncan only be connected to through the Tor network, and are accessed by special .onion\naddresses resolved by Tor directory servers. This offers several bene?ts to the operator of\nthe service. Such a service can be hosted from behind a ?rewall or NAT, and any attackers\nattempting to perform a distributed?denial?of?service attack will be stymied because they\ndo not know the machine?s IP address. For details on the hidden service protocols, see\nappendix C.\n\nSI) Currently, there are roughly 50 publicly advertised hidden services. This\nnumber seems low. Given Tor?s rising popularity it seems likely that more than 50 hidden\nservices exist. The ability to locate hidden services is important, as only then will we be\nable to police and or exploit them. Unfortunately, we were not able to ?nd any good way to\ndiscover a new hidden service or to ?nd where a known hidden service is hosted. For more\ndiscussion, see sections 7.2.2, Locating known hidden services and 7.3, Discovering\nunknown hidden services.\n\n7 Possible attacks\n\n(TS SI) This portion of the paper will be devoted to several possible attacks related to\nTor. Their application is mostly speculative, as we have not implemented any of them\nexcept for the MJOLNIR?related attacks, and we have not attempted any of them outside\n\n10\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nof the lab. These descriptions are intended to be used as possible avenues for future\nresearch and development.\n\n7.1 (TS SI) Denial-of?service-style attacks with MJOLNIR\n\n(TS SI) An unmodi?ed Tor client will never include a given server in a circuit more than\nonce. This ensures that no server will have to do more work than any other. However,\nonly the client can check for repeated servers. With MJOLNIR we can build an arbitrary\ncircuit of arbitrary length, violating nearly all restrictions on circuit construction with\nimpunity. This capability allows for many interesting DOS?style attacks as we can force\nother server to do many times the work we have to. Since Tor normally sends packets of\nlength 586, large circuits can heavily tax the Tor cloud in general, and a targeted server\nin particular.\n\n(TS SI) The biggest problem with these attacks is that they take us a large amount\nof work to set up. For an n?server circuit, we must send at least cells to set up that\ncircuit. Building a circuit can take a large amount of time, especially if the servers are on\ndifferent continents, as is the case in the Tor cloud. The number of packets generated is\non the order of n2, and the time to set up a circuit grows similarly. Once the circuit is set\nup, the amount of traf?c grows linearly with the number of servers on the circuit.\n\n(TS SI) The point of building these circuits is to get target servers to handle much\nmore traf?c than our client machine while not disturbing the rest of the Tor cloud. Once\nthe circuit is set up, this is not a problem. For example, if we set up a circuit in which one\nserver appears 50 times, it will always do at least 50 times more work than our machine\nonce the circuit is established. We can use this for two distinct types of attack.\n\n(TS SI) First, there is the possibility that if we had enough circuits running through\na target machine, we could cause a socket denial of service. Each connection between two\nTor servers uses distinct sockets. Once two machines are connected to each other, they\nwill always use the same sockets, but with enough machines connecting to a server, it is\ntheoretically possible to cause a machine to use all of its available sockets.\n\n(TS SI) Also, Tor gives servers the option of sending only a limited amount of traf?c\nthrough the Tor network in a given period (day, week, or month). By targeting a machine\nwith these attacks, we could cause a server to hibernate, essentially taking it out of the\nTor cloud until the next accounting period begins. This could also make bandwidth costs\nprohibitively high for targets.\n\n7.1.1 Coil attack\n\n(TS SI) Our ?rst implemented technique for achieving either type of attack is what we\ncall the ?coil? attack. For this attack, we choose two target servers and set up a circuit that\nbounces back and forth between the two, ?coiling? them around each other. When we set\nup a circuit of me coils, the circuit will actually be composed of 2nC servers. This is because\nfor each coil both targets are included once. This attack is concentrated, but requires two\ntargets in order to work. This may be detected by an observant sysadmin, but by default,\n\n11\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nTor?s logs do not store IP addresses, so the information would have to come from elsewhere.\nEven given the necessary IP information, the system administrator will see only the other\ntarget sending and receiving large quantities of information. Without further investigation\nand some creative thinking, it is highly likely that the system administrator will assume\nour other target is actually launching the attack. We can leverage the anonymity\nprovided by Tor to protect ourselves from easy detection by simply appending this coil\nonto the end of a circuit.\n\n7.1.2 Flower attack\n\n(TS SI) Our second implemented technique for achieving a attack is what we call the\n??ower? attack, and it targets only one server. In this attack, MJOLNIR builds a circuit\nto a random server, then to the target, then another random one, then the target, and so\non for a speci?ed number of ?petals.? When we set up a ?ower with np petals, the circuit\nwill actually be composed of 2n,p servers. The ?ower attack distributes most of the load\namongst the machines of the Tor cloud, so at most the target server will suspect that it is\nbeing attacked. But even if the target knows about an attack, it will have to assume that\nsomeone is trying a distributed denial?of?service attack. While the system administrator\nwill likely recognize that his attacker(s) are leveraging Tor, Tor?s strong anonymity will\nleave him with few options. He will be forced to accept it or reduce eliminate Tor usage\nof his machine.\n\n(TS SI) Perhaps the most serious ?aw with the ?ower attack is that administrators\non the petals might notice that their Tor traf?c is coming from and going to the same\nserver, a violation of Tor?s protocol which clearly requires a custom client. However, the\npetals still would not have enough information to know where the request originated, and\nany attempt to discover this would necessarily break the anonymity of Tor. In order to get\naround this, we could build a petal with two servers between the instances of the target\nserver. In this way, no server realizes that it is taking part in an attack.\n\n7.2 Traf?c analysis\n\n(S SI) Is there a way to undo the anonymity that Tor provides? It does not appear that\nTor leaks any signi?cant information about the client to anyone other than the client.\nHowever, it is still possible to analyze the pattern of traf?c in and out of the Tor cloud to\ntry to determine which clients are responsible for which requests. Tor does not make such\nan attack (here referred to as a correlation attack) easy.\n\n7.2.1 (U) A basic Tor circuit\n\n(U) The most common activity in Tor is carried out across circuits 3 nodes long. A client\nconnects to a ?rst server, which connects to a second server, which connects to a third\nserver, which connects to the desired web page or other service.\n\n12\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n(TS SI) For this scenario, we are most interested in tracing a request back to the\nclient, assuming that we see an exit node connect to something we deem interesting. The\nworst (and most likely) case is that we will not own any of the servers along the way.\nThere are two types of potential correlation attacks, although both are complex.\n\n(S SI) First method: circuit tracing This method requires data on all of the\nconnections for each server in the attacked circuit. While currently unrealistic in general,\nthis is a potentially powerful attack. A small, private Tor network, for example, could\npossibly be completely compromised by this technique.\n\nWe also need to have a good idea of how long it takes to send data\nacross the network to another machine. This comes with the usual caveats that network\ncongestion, distance between links, and packet size affect transmission time. Although in\ntheory Tor packets are all the same size owing to the ?xed cell size, in practice we see\ndifferent packet sizes, as two or more cells sometimes get sent in the same packet. Despite\nthis, we should have a good idea of the network latency. Actual processing time devoted\nto the cells is minimal, and can be ignored.\n\n(S SI) We begin by focusing on an exit node making a connection to material of\ninterest. At this point, we must keep track of all of the connections that node has up.\nWhen the exit node receives data, it will send it back down the circuit that requested\nit. Thus data comes in to the exit node, and then the node will send out data over the\nappropriate connection.\n\n(S SI) Unfortunately, the exit node will almost certainly be sending data out over\nseveral connections. We must keep track of all of them. Let the network latency be \nseconds. When we see data get sent to the exit node, we only need to pay attention to\nthe outgoing connections that send out data roughly seconds later. We must take into\naccount some error in our timing, to allow for differences in latency owing to differences\nin network conditions. We then make a list of all of the nodes in the Tor cloud that the\nexit server sends data to. These are all potential second nodes.\n\nSI) The above process must be recursively performed on the list of potential\nsecond nodes. Hopefully this number of nodes will not be prohibitive, but we have no\nhard data about how many nodes a given machine in the Tor cloud is simultaneously\nconnected and actively sending data to. Again, we will use the timing to determine which\nconnections are of interest. This is made easier by the fact that no node will appear\ntwice in a circuit, meaning that we can ignore any outgoing connections from our possible\nsecond nodes to our exit server. We can also ignore any connections made to machines\noutside of the Tor cloud clients) because the second server should only be talking to\nother Tor servers. Now we have an even larger list of nodes to look at, and these are our\npossible entry servers.\n\n(S SI) Finally, we look at the outgoing connections from the entry servers that are\nsending out information roughly seconds after the possible second nodes. This is made\neasier by the fact that we are really only interested in connections into the Tor cloud from\noutside of the Tor cloud, so we can ignore any connections made to other Tor servers. So\n\n13\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nnow, we have a large list of potential circuits.\n\n(S SI) From here, we watch for more interesting material to be sent to the exit\nserver and repeat the process. We should get a different set of potential circuits, as not\nevery connection should be active again at roughly the same time except the connections\nalong the circuit for which we are looking. There should be some overlap between the two\nlists. This intersection is our new, smaller list of potential circuits. After repeating this\nprocess enough times, we should only have one circuit, or at most, a handful.\n\n(TS SI) This analysis becomes easier for each box that we own along the circuit,\nsince we then know for sure which incoming connection matches which outgoing connection\non that box. This means that our tree of potential circuits branches one less time. Owning\nthe exit server is probably most useful for this type of analysis, since it is the only machine\nknown to be a part of the circuit from the beginning.\n\n(TS SI) There are some dif?culties. How many potential circuits will result from\neach iteration? Without some data on the real Tor cloud regarding how many connections\neach server is sending data over for a given span of time, it is impossible to say. It would\nnot be surprising if this number turns out to be very, very large, even with the pruning at\neach step. Assuming the number of potential circuits is not too large to work with, how\nmany iterations of this algorithm will it be necessary to run before we can track down the\none, true circuit? Again, without some real data about the Tor cloud it is impossible to\nsay. Clearly, the more potential circuits we ?nd at each iteration, the more iterations it\nwill take to narrow the list down to one.\n\nThe biggest problem with this idea is that Tor will only use a circuit\nfor a short period of time before tearing down and building a new one. Currently, the\ndefault period of time for this is 10 minutes, and Tor checks every 30 seconds to see if any\ncircuits need torn down. So at best there are 10 minutes during which one can perform\nthis analysis.\n\n(TS SI) Second method: Black-box the Tor cloud In order for this attack to\nwork, we only need to see connections entering and exiting the Tor cloud. When we see\nan exit server make a request of a service that we are interested in, we keep track of when\ninformation is sent back into the Tor cloud. We then keep track of each client connected\nto the Tor cloud that receives data afterward for an arbitrary amount of time, probably\na TCP timeout. This will likely be an enormous number of clients. Each client will have\na certain probability of being the one that made the request; for example, a client that\nreceives information 2 seconds after the service sends back some data is more likely to\nbe the one that requested it than a client that receives information 10 seconds after the\nservice sends the data. Each time we see the service send information back to that same\nexit server, we track which clients receive data during the right time frame. Each iteration\nwill give us a large number of clients, but we are only interested in the clients that receive\ninformation each time, that is, clients in the intersection of all the sets. The client making\nthe requests must be in that intersection. The client with the highest total probability\nover all the iterations is the most likely to be the target.\n\n14\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n(TS SI) This technique is essentially a wide?scale version of the circuit?tracing tech?\nnique, and is less precise. However, it should be easier to collect this information, as there\nare currently only around 450 publicly known exit servers, and it is easier to watch connec?\ntions from 450 machines to the outside of the Tor cloud than it is to watch all connections\nof all machines, as the circuit?tracing method requires. The hope is that the large amount\nof data we could collect for this method would compensate for its less precise nature.\n\n7.2.2 (S SI) Locating known hidden services\n\n(S SI) In the case of a hidden service, the most likely scenario is that we know about\na hidden service and to want to know where on what machine) it is located. We\nwould use a Tor client and connect to the hidden service in order to set up a circuit. See\nappendix for a description of hidden service circuits. For a normal hidden service circuit,\ncircuit tracing would have to stretch across a circuit containing ?ve servers, making it too\ncomplex, and we can not use the Tor black box approach. Things must be done somewhat\ndifferently.\n\n(TS SI) If we know the rendezvous point (RP), the analysis becomes more man?\nageable. We can set a preferred RP using the con?guration ?le of even a basic Tor client.\nThis will work for our purposes, but if we do that, then we will be using a normal Tor\nserver as a RP, meaning that it will have several connections through it at a given time.\nIf we program a custom client to choose an arbitrary RP, perhaps even making the client\nbox the RP (see section 8.1), then we can choose a RP outside of the Tor cloud, meaning\nthat the only connections through it will be ones related to the hidden service. For this\nattack, assume that we know the RP, as well as the server that it is connected to for this\ncircuit.\n\n(S SI) When the client makes a request, it will go to the RP, which will send it\ndown another circuit to the hidden service. This gives us a chance to to see what node\nthe RP is connected to (call it the ?rst node). Then, we check the timing in the same\nmanner as in the basic Tor circuit to see to which servers it is connected. We can ignore\nany connections that go outside of the Tor cloud. We now have a list of potential second\nnodes. In a similar fashion, we check the timing of all of these to see to which servers they\nare connected. One of these is the hidden service.\n\n(S SI) The hidden service will respond, so we will see data come back up the circuit\nto the RP. This gives us another chance to work with the timing to try and ?gure out\nthe circuit. It would be easiest to ?gure out the second node during this step. One would\nhave to see which machines are talking to the ?rst node just before it talks to our RP, and\ncorrelate that list with our possible second nodes from when the request was sent down\nthe circuit. The actual second node should be in the intersection of these two lists.\n\n(S SI) As with the normal Tor circuit, this will likely give us many potential circuits,\nand need to be iterated several times before the hidden service is located. There are two\nmain advantages over the same analysis for a normal Tor circuit. The ?rst is that there\nare fewer servers between the RP and the hidden service, meaning that we only need to\nkeep track of two possible branches in the circuit, instead of three. The second is that we\n\n15\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ncan ask the hidden service to connect to the RP as many times as we want, whenever we\nwant. This allows us to perform the correlation over and over again, albeit with different\ncircuits each time. The more data we have, the more likely we are to locate the hidden\nservice.\n\n(S SI) We know that the hidden service will never build a circuit to the RP that\ncontains the hidden service machine, although it can be its own RP. Thus, whatever\nmachine the hidden service is on will never be the machine that connects to the RP. Every\ntime we ask the hidden service to build a circuit to the RP, we keep track of which machines\nare connecting to the RP. Eventually there will be a sizable list of machines that cannot be\nthe hidden service. It is doubtful that we will narrow it all the way down to the machine\non which the hidden service is located, but it will help us prune the possible branches from\npossible second nodes.\n\n(S SI) The hidden service may have a list of nodes that it will never use in a circuit\n(under ExcludeNodes in the con?guration these will never show up as the machine\nthat connects to the RP. It will, however, use a server listed under ExcludeNodes as an RP.\nAlso, the hidden service may have set up one or more entry guards for its circuits, meaning\nthat the ?rst node from the hidden service (the second node in the above example) will\nalways be one of those routers. If it has only set up one entry guard, that machine will\nalso never be the one that connects to the rendezvous point. This is unlikely, because most\nof the time one sets up multiple entry guards. A ?xed ?rst node effectively shortens your\ncircuit by one hop. So this analysis may turn up the hidden service?s excluded nodes and\nentry guards even if it does not locate the hidden service.\n\n7.3 (S SI) Discovering unknown hidden services\n\n(S SI) We did not discover any method to detect previously unknown hidden services.\nIf a hidden service is being offered on a machine that is also a Tor server, there may be\nsome noticeable difference between its traf?c and that of a typical Tor server. However, a\nhidden service may be offered on a machine outside of the Tor cloud.\n\n(S SI) In our time in the lab, we found that running an nmap on a node that is\noffering a hidden service will turn up the port that the hidden service is using to deal with\nincoming connections. It can then be directly connected to, outside of Tor.\n\n(TS SI) There are several issues with this. We must already suspect the machine\nof housing a hidden service to decide to do the nmap, or alternately, nmap several servers\nin the hopes of turning up a hidden service. Then, the machine running the hidden service\nwill likely have several ports open, and there is no way to tell which port is offering a\nhidden service just by looking at the list of open ports. A hidden service may even be\noffered on a well?known port such as port 80. We would have to try to connect to each of\nthe ports we see open on a machine to determine if there is a hidden service being run. We\nwould not even know which protocol the hidden service is running. It may be an HTTP\nserver, an FTP server, an SMTP server, etc. The only thing we know is that the protocol\nmust run over TCP. It is not enough to attempt to connect once to each port, using an\nHTTP GET request. Several protocols must be tried.\n\n16\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n(S SI) Also, keep in mind that the people running these hidden services are gener?\nally very careful, and all of these requests and nmaps are detectable by a canny system\nadministrator. We can hide ourselves by using Tor to route our requests, even if we don?t\ntry to access the hidden service the Tor way, but the attempt may well be detected. This,\ncombined with the shot?in?the?dark nature of the whole enterprise, limits its usefulness.\n\n7.4 Man-in-the-middle attack\n\nSI) Because Tor?s X.509 certi?cates are self?signed, it may be possible to perform\na man?in?the?middle attack using MJOLNIR to forge certi?cates. Assume that we wish\nto intercept traf?c between two Tor servers with the nicknames Alice and Bob. They\nwill send X.509 certi?cates that are structured in a very speci?c way; see section 5. We\ncan use MJOLNIR to create our own Tor?style X.509 certi?cate with ?Alice? or ?Bob?\nin the correct location and appear to be the other machine. From here, we carry out a\nman?in?the?middle attack in the normal fashion.\n\nSI) However, this only allows us to get under the layer of TLS \nAs covered in section B.3.2, the client sets up a layer of with the server (for\nexample, Bob) by passing it an ?onion skin?. Most of the time, this is done using a\nCREATE cell which contains half of a Dif?e?Hellman handshake. The contents of this\nCREATE cell are to Bob?s publicly advertised RSA key. This means that we\nwon?t be able to read the CREATE cell, and we still won?t be able to read the contents\nof the cells that go through the man?in?the?middle. All we will be able to see is 3 bytes of\nheader on the cells that we would relay through.\n\n(TS SI) If the man?in?the?middle intercepts a cell, it will be able\nto read the value that it contains and create a shared secret with the client, in effect\nbecoming the ?rst server in the circuit. The intended ?rst server can be completely removed\nfrom the circuit, and the man?in?the?middle will see which server is second in the client?s\ncircuit.\n\n(TS SI) We did not test this in our work, so there may be issues with this attack\nthat we did not foresee. At the very least, there is still the obstacle of the authoritative\ndirectory servers. They act in a fashion similar to a trusted third party. The directory\nlisting weakly associates speci?c RSA public keys with speci?c server nicknames. If a\nserver operator registers their Tor server with the authoritative directory server (this must\nbe done out?of?band), then this becomes a strong association, and certi?cates with Alice?s\nname will not be accepted unless they have Alice?s listed public key. Thus, it may not\nalways be possible to perform this attack. However, the authoritative directory servers\nappear vulnerable. See section 8.4 for further discussion.\n\n8 (U) Future areas of study\n\n(TS SI) There are still many interesting and important areas of Tor functionality to ex?\nplore. As with any software project, there are always bugs to ?x and features to add. There\n\n17\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nare also two major avenues of exploration in the architecture of Tor itself that warrant\nfurther study because they may provide ways to discover important target information.\n\n8.1 (U FOUO) Expanding functionality\n\nThe Tor code provided a solid basis for our work on MJOLNIR, but every\nmodi?cation opens up the opportunity for bugs to arise. All of our work was done in a\nsmall lab with eight machines, so the MJOLNIR code must be tested on a larger network\nto see if it still behaves correctly, or if its response time is simply too long to be useful.\nThere remain large portions of code that are only useful to servers that can safely be cut\nfrom the MJOLNIR main code. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to completely\ndivorce the client and server sides of Tor?s code.\n\nSI) MJOLNIR still has one major de?ciency: it cannot connect to hidden\nservices. In order to successfully connect to one, the client must set up a circuit to a\nrendezvous point, then to an introduction point, then must request that the hidden service\nmeet it at the rendezvous point. Doing this much is very important, and with the right\nmodi?cations, it becomes possible to have a client be its own rendezvous point. As such,\nthere will be only two servers between our client and the hidden service, making a traf?c\nanalysis attack easier, which may open the way for locating the identity and location of\nhidden services.\n\n8.2 (U) Privoxy\n\n(U FOUO) Tor is useful only for rerouting traf?c so that one?s location and or browsing\nhabits are kept secret. Tor does not examine the packets it sends for identifying information\nsuch as IP addresses. Because of this, Tor is packaged with Privoxy, a free software ?ltering\nproxy. Privoxy?s purpose is to scrub all identifying information from HTTP requests, etc.\nAny Tor user who is not using a ?ltering proxy like Privoxy is probably leaking identifying\ninformation, especially in DNS requests. There may be situations in which Privoxy does\nnot hide all of the information that needs to be hidden for perfect anonymity. However,\nwe did not have time to study the interaction between Tor and Privoxy, and it warrants\nsome attention.\n\n8.3 (U) Tor remote control\n\n(TS SI) One area of interest that we looked at brie?y before turning to other, more useful,\nideas was the possibility of using Tor?s control port to control a client or server. Tor offers\nthe option to set up a control port. A control port would allow one to remotely control\nany standard con?guration option of his Tor server as if he were directly editing Tor?s\ncon?guration ?le. However, this did not offer the ?exibility or power that we needed to\nset up a custom client, so we abandoned the idea early on. This does not mean that there\nis no useful application of using the control port. For example, one may be able to set up\na carefully selected set of entry guards or exit servers (or both) so that suspected target\n\n18\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ntraf?c will always route through friendly servers. There may be other ways of exploiting\nthe control port, including going so far as to modify the target?s list of trusted directory\nservers. This might send the target client to a directory server in which all of the servers\nare friendly.\n\n8.4 (TS SI) Directory server exploitation\n\n(TS SI) It may also be useful to study Tor directory servers in more detail. Our work\nfocused solely on the client, but many attacks would be much easier with access to more\nTor servers. The directory servers ultimately control which Tor servers are used by clients.\nWe have found that a server can put itself on a directory server multiple times; all it takes\nis the server running several Tor processes, each having a different nickname, open port,\n?ngerprint, and log ?le. This only requires different con?guration ?les for the different\nprocesses, which are easy to set up. That machine will handle a disproportionate amount\nof traf?c, since it is listed several times. This increases the density of friendly servers in\nthe cloud without increasing the number of servers we have set up. Unfortunately, each\nlisting has the same IP address, which would be very noticeable to anyone who inspecting\nthe directories.\n\nSI) A more useful attack would be to fool Tor clients into believing that a\nfriendly box is actually someone else. This could potentially be accomplished by getting\nthe directory servers to list the friendly box as the other machine. That may allow us\nto see more information than the target wants us to see. For example, if we know that\na certain target has a list of preferred entry guards and exit servers, and if we can list\nour machines as those servers, then the target (or second node, respectively) will be very\nlikely to send traf?c through our machines, making it easier to correlate the traf?c and\ndetermine what the target is requesting and or where the target is.\n\n(TS SI) There may be many other applications of this type of attack, and for this\nreason, directory server exploitation should be looked into.\n\n9 (U) Acknowledgments\n\n(U FOUO) We would like to thank the CES Summer Program for giving us the oppor?\ntunity to work on this problem.

When a client or server builds a circuit, it is\nconnecting to the Tor cloud.\n\n(U) Programming details\n\nB.1 (U) Building circuits\n\n(U) The most important structure in Tor is the circuit, that is, the list of machines that\na client will send its traf?c through. Information regarding this circuit is maintained in\nthe circuit_t structure. This structure stores information regarding the connections and\nused by the machine when sending information along the circuit. For the client,\nit also contains a list of the servers along the path and the information to use\nwith each server.\n\n(U) When a user wants to build a circuit, most of the work happens in the func?\ntion circuit_establish_circuit. It is passed ?ve parameters: purpose, need_capacz'ty,\nneed_uptz'me, internal, and a pointer to info. These parameters contain information used to\ndetermine several aspects of the circuit that is ultimately built. In particular, info contains\n\n21\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ninformation for connecting to a speci?c exit server if one has already been chosen. (This\nonly happens when attempting to access one of Tor?s hidden services; see appendix \nbelow.) circuit_establish_circuit is a small function, consisting of only 20 lines. All\nof the real work happens in 4 function calls that it makes.\n\n(U) First, circuit_establish_circuit calls circuit_init, to which it passes pur-\npose, need_uptz'me, needmapacz'ty, and internal. Right away, this function calls another\nfunction, circuit_new. This function allocates memory for the circuit_t structure, ini?\ntializes several ?elds of the structure, calls circuit_add to add the new circuit to the\nglobal circuit list, and returns. Back in circuit_init, the parameters are used to ini?\ntialize more ?elds in the circuit_t structure. Next, it sets the state of the circuit to\nindicating that it is waiting to establish a connection to the next\nserver in the path before it sends along any packets. Finally, circuit_init returns a\npointer to the newly?created circuit_t structure.\n\n(U) Back in circuit_establish_circuit, the function onion_pick_cpath_exit is\ncalled and passed the pointer to the new circuit_t from circuit_init and the parameter\ninfo originally passed to circuit_establish_circuit. onion_pick_cpath_exit starts\nby getting the list of available routers using the function router_get_routerlist. This\nrouter list is created using information obtained from the directory servers. The process\nis not covered in this paper; see section 8.4.\n\n(U) Next, the function new_route_len is called to determine the number of servers\nthat should be in the circuit. This number is based on the purpose of the circuit and\nwhether or not info is NULL, but for most Tor circuits, it will be three. After a number\nhas been decided on, the function count_acceptable_routers checks how many servers it\nthinks can route traf?c. If the number of acceptable routers is less than two, the function\nreturns failure, and no circuit is built. If the number of available routers is two or more,\nbut less then what was decided on, this becomes the length of the circuit.\n\n(U) One of two things can happen next. If info is not NULL, then the server with that\ninformation will be used as an exit, and the program moves on. Otherwise, the program\npicks a good exit server. This is done in the function choose_good_exit_server, which\ntakes parameters purpose, dir (a router list), need_uptz'me, need_capacz'ty, and z's_z'nternal.\nThree of these are parameters originally sent to circuit_establish_circuit. There are\ntwo cases, based on the Circuit?s purpose. For general purpose circuits, if z's_z'nternal is set\n(meaning the circuit is intended to be used to connect to a server within the Tor cloud,\nmost likely as a rendezvous point for a hidden service), then the exit server is chosen\nusing router_choose_random_node (see Choosing a hop, section B.1.1). Otherwise,\nchooses the exit server. This function takes a list of\nall available exit servers, discards any that are currently unsuitable (for example, those\nservers that are listed as down), and selects from those remaining one that can handle the\nmost pending connections. It then returns the router information necessary to connect to\nthe selected server.\n\n(U) After initializing the circuit and picking out an exit, the other hops in the circuit\nmust be chosen. To do this, the program calls onion_populate_cpath. This function\nrepeatedly calls another function, onion_extend_cpath, until the whole circuit is built. In\n\n22\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nonion_extend_cpath, choose_good_entry_server is called to select the ?rst node in the\ncircuit. This takes the entire list of available servers, gets rid of those unsuitable (already\nchosen as the exit, listening on wrong port, etc.), and from the remainder, chooses a\nrandom node using router_choose_random_node.\n\n(U) For the middle hop, choose_good_middle_server is called. Essentially, this is\nthe same routine as choose_good_entry_server except that it also excludes from the list\nof possible routers those that have already been chosen as other hops in the circuit.\n\n(U) For each hop along the circuit, once a good router is chosen, the choice is re?\nturned to the calling function. The router is then appended onto the circuit by call?\ning onion_append_hop. This function ?rst calls onion_append_to_cpath which adds this\nrouter to the list of routers in the circuit. How does the program keep track of this list?\nOne of the elements of the circuit_t structure is cpath, which is actually a pointer to a\nstructure. All of the information necessary to connect to each router, in?\ncluding the IP address and between the two machines, can be found in this\nstructure, as well as a few simple bandwidth accounting ?elds. cpath points to the ?rst\nrouter in the circuit, but it also maintains next and prev members in the \nstructure, which, unsurprisingly, point to the next and previous routers in the circuit,\nrespectively. It is important to note that not only is this a doubly linked list, but it is also\ncircular.\n\n(U) After all three routers in the circuit have been chosen and appended to the\ncircuit, the program returns all the way back to circuit_establish_circuit and moves\non to the next important step, establishing connections to all of the routers.\n\nB.1.1 (U) Choosing a server\n\n(U) Most of the time, router_choose_random_node is called to choose which server will be\nused. Despite its name, the choice is not exactly random, and the function is passed several\nparameters to help with its decision. The most important arguments would be the list of\npreferred servers, and the lists of excluded servers. For some reason, two lists of excluded\nservers are passed: a character string containing server nicknames, and a smartlist_t\nstructure see below containing server information. The lists do not necessarily overlap.\nSeveral ?ags indicating user preferences regarding server capacity, uptime, and the like are\nalso passed. One of the arguments, strict, is set if the user will only accept a choice from\ntheir list of preferred servers.\n\n(U) The function begins by creating a smartlist of the preferred servers, from which\nit removes any excluded servers. It will then call smartlist_choose to select a random\nelement of that list.\n\nsmartlist_choose is a very simple function. In Tor, the smartlist_t\nstructure is essentially a resizable array, and several functions are provided to manage\nthem. (See appendix E, MJOLNIR API for more on smartlists.) smartlist_choose\ngenerates a random index and returns the element of the smartlist with that index. The\nrandom index is generated using the RAND_bytes function. Care is taken to\navoid bias in the random numbers, by making sure that the maximum value returned by\n\n23\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nRAND_bytes is a multiple of the size of the smartlist. For example, suppose the size of\nthe array is 10 and RAND_bytes could return any value up to 25. Then when computing a\nrandom index for the smartlist, the function would generate a value less than 25 and take\nit mod 10. Because 25 is not a multiple of 10, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 would occur\nmore often than for some reason no preferred server is chosen (for instance, no preferred servers\nwere speci?ed), two things can happen. If strict is set, the function returns NULL, indicat?\ning failure. Otherwise, the program continues by attempting to ?nd servers that meet the\npreferences indicated by the ?ags. This is done by creating a smartlist containing all run?\nning routers that meet the preferences, which is passed to smartlist_choose. The only ex?\nception is if the parameter needmapacity is set, in which case\nis called, which makes its random choice \ndifferently.\n\n(U) works differently than smartlist_choose.\nFor the given list of servers, it adds up all of the bandwidths. At the same time, it creates\na separate smartlist of each server?s bandwidth. For example if the ?rst three servers can\nhandle 200 bytes s, 450 bytes s, and 1000 bytes respectively, then the smartlist will have\nentries 200, 450, and 1000. Then, a random number between 0 and the total bandwidth\nis selected (using the same function as in smartlist_choose). It steps through\nthe smartlist of bandwidths, summing the bandwidths, and chooses the ?rst server where\nthe bandwidth sum is greater than the random number. Again returning to the example,\nif the random number was 412, the second server would be chosen, because 200 450 \n650, and 650 412. If the number was 70, the ?rst server would be chosen. We see that\nhigher bandwidth servers are more likely to be chosen than lower bandwidth servers, as\none would expect.\n\n(U) If the function is still unsuccessful in ?nding an acceptable server, the program\ntries one more time to ?nd a next hop, this time without setting any preferences. This is\nthe last resort; if no server can be found, then the function returns NULL and the circuit\nfails.\n\nB.2 (U) Connecting the circuit\n\n(U) Recall that a client records all of the servers in its circuit using the \nstructure. Once it has decided upon a complete circuit, the client must now connect the\nservers in the circuit so they can send information back and forth. In Tor, the connec-\ntion_t structure holds the information needed to set up such a connection, such as the\nIP address of the node it connects to, the port it should connect on, and a lot of other\ninformation. A connection is speci?ed by an id number. Connections and circuits are\nrelated in complex ways. A single connection may be part of several different circuits, and\neach circuit_t structure holds information on a previous and next connection (p_co7272 and\n72_co7272, respectively).\n\n(U) After all the servers that will make up the circuit have been determined,\ncircuit_establish_circuit calls circuit_handle_first_hop. First, this function re?\n\n24\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ntrieves information regarding the ?rst server from the Circuit?s cpath variable. This infor?\nmation is used to see if there is already a connection to that server. If so, that connection\nwill be used for the Circuit?s 72_co7272. The appropriate ?elds of the circuit_t structure\nare set to hold information about that connection, and circuit_send_next-onion_skin\nis called to set up the between the two routers. See B.3, for\nmore about the information sent in an ?onion skin?.\n\n(U) If there is no pre?existing connection to the ?rst server, the function\nconnection_or_connect is called. It takes as arguments the address, port, and iden?\ntity digest of the server being connected to. The identity digest is a hash of the\nserver?s public RSA key, and is often used to uniquely identify a particular router. A lot\nof things happen in this function, with the ultimate goal of returning a fully initialized\nconnection. First, it calls connection_new, which allocates memory for a new connection\nand initializes various members of the connection_t structure.\n\n(U) Next, connection_or_connect calls \nwhich is passed the newly created connection_t structure, and the address, port, and\nidentity digest of the server being connected to. It tries to retrieve the server?s information\nbased on its identity digest, which, if found, is used to ?ll in more variables in 72_co7272. If it\ncould not ?nd the server information, then the function will ?ll in the necessary information\nitself, occasionally using more generic information than would have been retrieved based\non the identity digest. With all of these things initialized, the function will return to\nconnection_or_connect.\n\n(U) The next important step is that connection_connect is called. This attempts to\ncreate a non?blocking socket connected to the IP address:port combination it was passed.\nMost of what goes on in here is basic socket calls. If successful, the connection is added\nto the global connection array, and read and write events for the connection are set up,\nusing libevent. The events on the connection are initially set to be non?reading and non?\nwriting, but as the program continues, the events will be changed to handle reads and\nwrites.\n\n(U) Finally, connection_or_connect will call \nwhich will start the TLS handshake between the two servers. After the TLS hand?\nshake completes, the client will send a CREATE cell to set up between it?\nself and the ?rst server. All of this will be discussed in the next section, \nSo once returns, everything up to and including\ncircuit_establish_circuit returns.\n\n(U) At this point, the circuit is still not fully connected. The client has set up\nits connection to the ?rst server, and is waiting for a CREATED cell in response to the\nCREATE cell it just sent. Once a CREATED cell is received, the client and the ?rst\nserver have ?nished agreeing on their and can communicate freely under\na layer of At this point, the client will make an EXTEND cell, which contains\nall of the information necessary to connect to the second server in the circuit as well as\ninformation for the layer of between the client and the second\nserver, and send it to the ?rst server.\n\n(U) The ?rst server will the cell, and read the information for connect?\n\n25\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ning to the second server. If there is already an existing connection between the two\nservers, that connection will be used for communication along this circuit. If not, then\nconnection_or_connect is called to open a connection between the two; see above. Once a\nconnection is open, the ?rst server packages the information for the second\nhop in a CREATE cell and sends it to the second server. Upon receiving a CREATED\ncell from the second hop, the ?rst server packages the necessary information into an \nTENDED cell, which it sends back to the client.\n\n(U) This whole process is repeated one more time, as the client sends an \nEXTEND cell through the ?rst server to the second server, which will send a corresponding\nCREATE cell to the third server. Again, an EXTENDED cell gets sent back to the client\nafter the third server sends back a CREATED cell. Once the client has ?nished setting up\nthe between itself and the third server, all of the connections in the circuit\nhave been made, and it is considered open. Any applications waiting to send packets\nthrough Tor are noti?ed that there is a new circuit available to use.\n\nB.3 (U) \n\n(U) Tor packets are sent under several layers of Each connection between two\nmachines is under TLS Additionally, each Tor payload is by the\nclient once for each hop in the circuit, using a symmetric cipher.\n\n(U) In Tor, all information to set up the symmetric cipher between the client and\nthe servers in the circuit is sent in what is known as an ?onion skin?. In a basic Tor\ncircuit, three onion skins are sent from the client, one for each server in the circuit. Each\nserver reads its onion skin, sets up its and sends back information to the\nclient to allow the two machines to share In this way, the client gets the\nnecessary information to put its data under one layer of for each server in the\ncircuit. All cells across a typical Tor circuit will be under three layers of when\nit is sent, and each server will strip off one layer. See ?gure B.3 for a visual representation\nof this process. It is these layers of that give Tor its designation as an ?Onion\nRouting Network?. The last server in the circuit will have the cell in the clear and be able\nto pass along the request found inside.\n\nB.3. 1 \n\n(U) Tor?s TLS handshake is carried out in 3 main phases. The function\n(see above, Connecting the circuit) calls\nwhich allocates memory for a new Tor TLS context\nand initializes several of its ?elds, including the socket that will be written to and the\nthat will be used for communication. The is initialized at Tor startup,\nand is changed every 2 hours. It is this structure that contains the certi?cates that are\nused during the TLS handshake, as well as the list of cipher suites to be used. Tor?s cer?\nti?cates are discussed in more detail in section 5, Tor?s X.509 certi?cates. By default,\nTor supports 2 cipher suites:\n\n26\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n  \n\nGE \n\n \n \n  \n\n  \n\nclient\n\n   \n\n\n\nFigure 2: Layers Of on a normal GET.\n\n\n(this is preferred)\n\n(U) Once the TLS context is properly initialized, the TLS handshake continues in\nwhich calls tor_tls_handshake. This calls\nSSL_connect or SSL_accept, depending on which side of the handshake this is on. As?\nsuming there are no errors, the program moves on to \nwhich validates the handshake and extracts the identity key from the certi?cate. If every?\nthing checks out, then the server is considered authenticated and future communications\nwill take place under TLS \n\nB.3.2 (U) Onion skins\n\n(U) After the client picks out its circuit and sets up a connection to the ?rst server in the\ncircuit, it will send an onion skin to the ?rst server. This is held in the payload of either\na CREATE or a cell. What?s the difference? When the client connects\nto the ?rst server, it does so using TLS. This means that it has already authenticated the\n?rst server?s identity and negotiated a key. This allows it to send a cell,\nwhich does not require an RSA operation nor a Dif?e?Hellman operation, since most of\nthe necessary information has already been established. Note that a cell\ncan only be sent between a client and the ?rst server in the path, because all other servers\nneed to be authenticated, and the client has no TLS connection directly to them. For this\nreason, CREATE cells are sent for all other servers in a circuit.\n\n(U) cells are simple. The cell contains only a random value,\ncreated using Tor?s function, which calls the function RAND_bytes.\nThe client sends this to the ?rst server in its circuit. When a server receives a \ncell, it extracts the value and calculates a random value using \n\n27\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nIt sends the value back in a cell, along with a hash based on\nwhere denotes concatenation. is the shared secret and will be used to generate\nthe keys between the two machines. When the client receives the cell, it\nwill perform the same hash based on that the ?rst server should have and compare it\nto the value in the cell. If the two values agree, then the keys for communication between\nthe two machines are set up. (see Keys, below.)\n\n(U) An onion skin in a CREATE cell is more complex. The ?rst 42 bytes are OAEP\npadding, the next 16 bytes are a symmetric key. This is done using calls. The\nlast 128 bytes of payload are the 956 value for a Dif?e?Hellman handshake. The ?rst 128\nbytes of this cell (which goes up to about halfway through the 956 value) are \nusing the second server?s public RSA key. The rest of the cell is with AES in\ncounter mode, using the symmetric key from the ?rst half of the cell.\n\n(U) When a server receives a CREATE cell, it extracts gs?, generates a random gy,\ncomputes the shared secret and sends back a CREATED cell containing g? as well as\na hash based on If a machine other than the client gets a CREATED cell g.\nthe ?rst hop receives a CREATED cell from the second hop), it puts the information in\nan EXTENDED cell, and sends it to the client. When the client gets a CREATED cell or\nan EXTENDED cell, it calculates and checks that the accompanying hash is correct.\nThe client uses to set up the keys that will be used when it communicates with that\nnode. Note that this key exchange required expensive RSA and Dif?e?Hellman operations,\nin contrast to the simple random number generation of the exchange.\n\n(U) Keys (U) When a CREATED or cell is received, the function\ncircuit_f inish_handshake is called. It will extract the shared secret and use it to create\nkeys for communication. Recall that for a CREATED cell the shared secret is and for\na cell the shared secret is Denote the shared secret as 0.\n\n(U) Regardless of which type of cell is received, the function\nis passed the shared secret. It does a series of hashes to get\nwhere denotes concatenation. This should\nnot include more than 5 hashes (each hash is 20 bytes long). Any extra bytes are ignored.\n\n(U) The ?rst 20 bytes of form H, the handshake digest. This is used to make\nsure the other node?s handshake checks out. The next 20 bytes become f, the forward\ndigest, and the next 20 bytes become Db, the backward digest. These digests are used for\nintegrity?checking purposes. They seed a hash that is used by machines to to determine\nwhether or not a cell has been all the way or not. is used for client to server\nstreams, and Db is used for server to client streams. The next 16 bytes of become f,\nand the next 16 bytes of become Kb. and Kb are the keys used to and\nthe streams of data between the two machines. is used for client to server\nstreams, and Kb is used for server to client streams. All other bytes are discarded.\n\n28\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n(U) Hidden services\n\nC.1 (U) Offering a hidden service\n\n(U) In order to offer a hidden service, the operator of the service (whom we will call\nBob) must ?rst add lines to their Tor con?guration ?le indicating the directory containing\ninformation regarding the hidden service and the port on which the hidden service will\nbe advertised. After Tor starts up with this new con?guration ?le, it will automatically\ngenerate an RSA public private key pair, and create a .onion address for the service. The\naddress is of the form x.onion, where is based on the service?s public key. Speci?cally,\nis the base?32 encoding of the ?rst 80 bits of the hash of the public key.\n\n(U) At this point, Tor picks out at least 3 servers in the cloud to act as introduction\npoints. Bob may use the con?guration ?le to specify particular servers that he wants to act\nas intro points, but if he does not, Tor will simply choose a servers randomly. Once the intro\npoints have been decided upon, Bob does two things. He will generate a service descriptor,\nwhich contains information about his public key and how to connect to his introduction\npoints. This service descriptor can be uploaded to the public directory servers, but it\nneed not be if Bob does not wish to have his service publicly known. Bob will also create\ncircuits to his introduction points. Once the circuit is connected, he will send along cells\nwhich contain his public key, a hash based on (see Keys, in B.3, and\na signature based on that data. These are called cells.\n\n(U) When an intended introduction point receives the \ncell, it checks that the information is well?formed and correctly signed. If so, it sends a cell\nback to Bob acknowledging that it will act as an introduction point for his hidden service.\nIt also makes note that the circuit on which it received the \ncell will be used when dealing with requests for Bob?s hidden service, and associates it\nwith Bob?s public key.\n\n(U) When Bob receives acknowledgment from his introduction points, he considers\nthe introduction circuits open, he will advertise his service descriptors to the Tor directory\nservers if he so desires, and he is now ready to receive requests to access the hidden service.\n\nC.2 (U) Accessing a hidden service\n\n(U) There are several ways that a client (whom we will call Alice) can become aware of\nBob?s hidden service. At the very least, she must receive Bob?s public key somehow, most\nlikely through some out?of?band communication such as a phone conversation or \ne?mail. Using this, she can request Bob?s service descriptor from the Tor directory servers\nif Bob has chosen to advertise his service publicly. Otherwise, Alice must know Bob?s\nentire service descriptor through some other means.\n\n(U) Once Alice has the descriptor and decides to talk to Bob?s hidden service, she\nmust ?rst set up a circuit to some server in the Tor cloud, known as a rendezvous point\n(RP). This point is chosen randomly, although Alice can add a line to her Tor con?guration\n?le that will indicate preferred RPs. Once the circuit is established, Alice sends a \n\n29\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\ncell to the RP, which contains a randomly generated\nnumber referred to as a rendezvous cookie (RC).\n\n(U) When the RP receives the cell, it will\nsend an acknowledgment back to Alice, and make note that the circuit the cell came in on\nis to be used for a rendezvous, and is associated with that RC.\n\n(U) After Alice receives acknowledgment from the RP, she builds a circuit to one of\nthe introduction points listed in Bob?s service descriptor. Once connected, she will send\na cell to the intro point, which contains a hash of Bob?s public\nkey, as well as information intended for Bob that is to his public key. When\nthe introduction point sees the cell, it checks the hash against the\nhashes of the hidden service public keys that it knows and ?nds the circuit associated with\nthat public key. It then sends the cell (now encapsulated as a \ncell, with the same payload) down that circuit, to Bob. Afterward, it sends Alice acknowl?\nedgment that her cell was sent, and Alice will shut down her circuit to the introduction\npoint.\n\n(U) When Bob receives a cell, he it and pulls out\nthe data Alice sent. This includes information for connecting to the RP, the RC, and\nAlice?s half of a Dif?e?Hellman handshake, gs?. If Bob decides to talk to Alice, he will\ncreate a circuit to the speci?ed RP. Bob sends the RP a cell,\nwhich contains the RC, Bob?s half of the Dif?e?Hellman handshake and the for his\ninteraction with Alice.\n\n(U) When the RP receives a cell, it ?nds the circuit as?\nsociated with the given RC. It then sends g? and in a cell\ndown that circuit to Alice. It makes note of the fact that the circuit from Alice and the\ncircuit from Bob are linked, and zeroes out the RC so no one else can attempt to connect\nto Alice?s circuit.\n\n(U) Finally, Alice receives the cell and uses it to complete\nthe Dif?e?Hellman handshake and initialize the between her and Bob. Now\nAlice and Bob can talk across this newly?formed rendezvous circuit in almost the exact\nsame way as a normal circuit. Neither knows what is on the other side of the RP, so they\ndon?t know where the other person?s machine is located. The content of their messages is\nunder the normal circuit as well as one more layer based on their shared secret.\n\n(U) Information at the nodes\n\n(S SI) It is possible for us to have a friendly computer in the Tor cloud. For example, we\ncan set up a server and advertise it to the Tor directory servers, like all other users. We\nmight compromise another server in the Tor cloud through other means. So how much do\nwe know about the traf?c that we are sending and receiving across circuits? Tor does a\ngood job of hiding information about the circuit from all of the nodes in the circuit, in\nmost cases allowing nodes to know only about the machines to which they are directly\nconnected. However, some information is still leaked simply by being a part of the circuit,\n\n30\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nand there are some instances where Tor gives the machines more information than\nis needed. The following section attempts to provide a list of information known by each\nserver (here referred to as a node) along the circuit.\n\nD.1 (U) First node\n\n(U) The ?rst node in the circuit is the only node that knows the location of the machine\noriginating the request. It sets up a circuit_t variable with a particular p_circ_id and\narranges a shared secret with the originating node. (See section B.3.2). When the client\nextends the circuit to the second node, the ?rst node receives an EXTEND cell with the\naddress, port, and identity ?ngerprint of the second node. It sets up a connection to the\nsecond node and sets n_circ_id in its circuit_t variable with a new circuit ID. The second\nnode will send back a cell containing its half of a Dif?e?Hellman handshake (that is, 99),\nand (see Keys in section B.3.2 for an explanation of After this, the ?rst node\nshould not receive any cells that it will be able to recognize, because the cells will be\nIn short, the ?rst node knows:\n\nThe location of the client that connected to it.\n\nused for communication with the client, which allow it to perform\none layer of on cells to from the client.\n\n0 The ID of the circuit from which the client is sending information. This is p_circ_id\nin the ?rst node?s circuit_t structure.\n\n0 The location of the second node in the circuit.\n\n0 The ID of the circuit on which it sends information to the second node. This is\nn_circ_id in the ?rst node?s circuit_t structure, and will be different from p_circ_id.\n\ngy in the Dif?e?Hellman handshake between the client and the second node, and H.\n\n(S SI) However, a machine may not know that it is the entry node. If the common?\nName on the X.509 certi?cate passed during the TLS handshake is ?client <identity>?,\nthen it is de?nitely an entry node, because it is talking directly to the client. This is\nsuf?cient, but not necessary. If the machine receives a cell, then it is\nthe entry node, as clients will never send a cell farther down the circuit.\nThere is an option in the con?guration ?le that can be set so that a Tor client will never\nuse a cell, and Tor servers will never use them, but this still appears to\nbe the most common way that the entry node is set up. Otherwise, a CREATE cell is\nused. If the node receives a CREATE cell, followed by an EXTEND cell, it may be the\nentry node. The only guarantee for such a pattern is that it is not the exit server, which\nwill never see an EXTEND cell.\n\n(TS SI) This knowledge would be useless unless we can induce the client to pick\none of our machines as its entry node. In the con?guration ?le, there is an option called\n\n31\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nwhich is a comma?separated list of server nicknames. Any servers on that\nlist will be preferred when choosing an entry node. If the option is true,\nthen only servers from that list can be chosen as entry nodes. If the con?guration ?le can\nbe changed to have a client always use a friendly machine for an entry node, then we can\ndiscover who is using Tor, if not what they are requesting.\n\nD.2 (U) Second node\n\n(U) The second node has the least information of any node in the circuit. It does not know\nwho or where the client is, nor does it know what or where the client is connecting to. It\ndoes know:\n\n0 The location of the machine connected to it.\n\nused for communication with the client, which allow it to perform\none layer of on cells to from the client.\n\n0 The ID of the circuit from which the ?rst node is sending information. This is\np_circ_id in the second node?s circuit_t structure, and should be equal to n_circ_id\nin the ?rst node?s circuit_t structure.\n\n0 The location of the third node in the circuit.\n\n0 The ID of the circuit on which it sends information to the third node. This is n_circ_id\nin the second node?s circuit_t structure, and will be different from p_circ_id.\n\ngy in the Dif?e?Hellman handshake between the client and the third node, and H.\n\n(S SI) A machine cannot de?nitely know that it is the second node in a circuit. If\nit receives a CREATE cell followed by an EXTEND cell on the same circuit, then there\nis a good chance it is the second node. However, this same pattern is possible for the ?rst\nnode. Because ?rst nodes often see cells instead of CREATE cells, it is\nmore likely that if a machine sees such a pattern, it is the second node.\n\n(TS SI) It is not possible to induce a client to pick our machine as a second node.\nThe second node is chosen using router_choose_random_node, with no list of preferred\nnodes passed to it. The only possible way is to edit the client?s con?guration ?le so\nthat their list of excluded servers excludes all boxes except friendly ones, but that seems\nunrealistic, since that would probably entail listing hundreds of server nicknames in their\ncon?guration ?le.\n\nD.3 (U) Third node\n\n(U) The third node is the exit node for a basic Tor circuit. This means that it sees request\nthat the client makes in the clear, which is useful information. The downside is that the\nthird node has no idea who or where the client is. The exit node knows:\n\n32\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nThe location of the machine connected to it.\n\nThe ID of the circuit from which the second node is sending information. This is\np_circ_id in the third node?s circuit_t structure, and should be equal to n_circ_id in\nthe second node?s circuit_t structure.\n\n0 shared with the client, which allows it to perform one layer of en?\non cells to from the client.\n\n0 The exit node can see the data the client is sending, such as an HTTP request or\nPOST data for a form.\n\n(S SI) A machine can know it is the exit node very easily. There are several functions\nonly called by exit nodes, such as connection_exit_begin_conn. There is even a macro,\nthat will return true if it is passed an exit connection (or an AP connection,\nwhich only appears at the client side of the circuit).\n\n(TS SI) Similar to entry nodes, a client can set up preferred exit nodes in their\ntorrc ?le. There is an option called EpitNodes that is a comma?separated list of server\nnicknames, and any servers on that list will be preferred when choosing an exit node. If\nthe option StrictExitNodes is true, then only nodes from that list can be chosen as exit\nnodes. So the con?guration ?le can be changed to have a client always come to a friendly\nmachine for an exit server.\n\n(TS SI) There is one other way to in?uence a client to choose a speci?c machine\nfor the exit. Servers have exit policies, which are lists of types of requests that a server\nwill handle. For example, by default, all servers reject traf?c sent to port 25 (SMTP) in\norder to discourage spammers from using Tor?s network to hide their activities. One can\neven set up a server that will reject all exit traf?c, and only act as a ?rst or second nodeserver with a more permissive exit policy than most other machines, we\nwill be chosen more often to handle the sort of traf?c that other machines will not allow.\nFor example, if we were to allow connections to port 25, our server would be chosen to\nsend e?mail with higher probability than it would for sending other types of traf?c. We\nhave no speci?c statistics regarding common exit policies, and even if we offer a certain\nexit policy, that doesn?t mean that people will think to try to send such traf?c through\nTor. Still, this option is more attractive than altering a client con?guration ?le, because\nit only requires a change on a machine that we own.\n\nD.4 (U) Hidden service nodes\n\n(U) As covered in appendix C, Tor uses special nodes when accessing hidden services.\n\nD.4.1 (U) Introduction points\n\n(U) The introduction point is the third node in a circuit that starts at the hidden service,\nso it knows the information listed under Third Node above. It is also, brie?y, the third\n\n33\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nnode in a circuit coming from the client, but this circuit is shut down as soon as the intro\npoint passes along the hidden service request. In addition, it knows the RSA public key\n(modulus) for the hidden service. This is more information than it needs, because when\nit receives a request to access the hidden service, all that is passed along is a hash\nof the public key, so all the introduction point really needs is that hash. By giving the\nintroduction point the entire public key, Tor is leaking more information than it needs\nto. Of course, the only thing that the public key really gets us is the ability to connect\nto the hidden service, but that is not insigni?cant. Consider the (small) probability that\na hidden service that we do not know about will select a friendly machine as one of its\nintroduction points, and the usefulness is clear.\n\n(S SI) A machine knows that it is an introduction point as soon as it receives an\ncell, which contains the public key info.\n\n(TS SI) The hidden service can select its introduction points in its con?guration\n?le through a ?eld called HiddenServiceNodes. By changing that ?eld, we can in?uence\nthe hidden service to choose our box as its introduction point, but if we are on their box\nalready, there are far more useful things we can do, like obtaining the hidden service?s\nprivate key. If HiddenServiceNodes is empty, then introduction points are picked using\nrouter_choose_random_node.\n\nD.4.2 (U) Rendezvous points\n\n(TS SI) Rendezvous points are the most knowledgeable nodes in a hidden service circuit.\nWhen accessing a hidden service, a client must ?rst set up a circuit to a rendezvous point\n(RP). The RP is the third node in this circuit, so it knows all the information a third node\nknows; see above. In addition to this basic third node information, the rendezvous point is\nalso given a ?rendezvous cookie?, a random 20?byte number which the RP will use later.\nAfter this circuit is set up, the client requests access to the hidden service through the\nintroduction point (the RP sees none of this), and if the hidden service decides to allow\ncontact, it will set up a circuit to the RP. The RP is the third node in this circuit as well.\nThe hidden service sends a cell down this circuit that contains the rendezvous cookie, g?\nfor a Dif?e?Hellman handshake between the hidden service and the client, and H. Right\nnow, the RP only looks at the rendezvous cookie, but it would require only a trivial change\nto have it store the other values.\n\n(TS SI) At the RP, after it its layer of the cell is only under\none layer of based on the shared secret between the hidden service and the\nclient. We can also see This is a far cry from knowing the shared secret, but this is as\nclose to being able to see traf?c between the client and hidden service as we can get right\nnow. It is certainly the weakest point of the entire hidden service system.\n\nSI) A node knows that it is a rendezvous point as soon as it receives a \ncell, which contains the rendezvous cookie, and it\nknows that the hidden service and client are connected across it as soon as it receives a \ncell from the hidden service and sends a \ncell to the client.\n\n34\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n(S SI) Clients can be induced to choose a particular machine as a rendezvous point\nby changing the ?eld RendNodes in their con?guration ?le. If this ?eld is empty, the\nRP will be chosen using router_choose_random_node. Hidden services will connect to\nwhatever rendezvous point the client tells them to, even if that node is normally on their\nlist of excluded nodes, assuming that it decides to communicate with the client.\n\nMJOLNIR API\n\n(U FOUO) MJOLNIR attempts to make accessing Tor functionality simple. Below is an\nAPI describing the most useful functions of MJOLNIR, arranged by topic.\n\nE.1 (U) Initialization\n0 (U) int tor_init (void)\n\nDescription: This is the main entry point for the Tor client. It must be\ncalled before any Tor services are used.\n\nArguments: None.\n\nReturn Value: Return 0 on success; return a negative value on failure.\n\nNotes: This must be called before any other Tor functions are used. It can\nbe called multiple times without issue.\n\n0 int init_keys (const smartlist_t *subject, const smartlist_t *issuer)\n\nDescription: In addition to important initialization, init_keys gen?\nerates X.509 certi?cates (through internal functions), which the program will\nuse to communicate with the Tor cloud.\n\nArguments: The subject and issuer smartlists. See the documentation in\nthe section on smartlists and certi?cates.\n\nReturn Value: Return 0 on success and negative values on failure.\n\nNotes: This function must be called in order for the Tor client to have speci?c\ncerti?cates. If no commonName ?eld?value pair is passed in, it will generate\na random commonName (10?20 characters long). See the documentation for\nsubject and issuer smartlists.\n\nrouterstatus_t *set_chosen_dirserver (const char *nickname, int\nfascistfirewall)\n\nDescription: Call this with the nickname of any directory server, and then\nwhenever MJOLNIR needs to fetch something, it will use that directory.\n\nArguments:\n\n35\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n1. nickname: the nickname of the chosen directory server. If it is NULL or not\nthe nickname for any valid server, the dirserver will be chosen randomly.\n\n2. fascist?rewall: set to 1 if MJOLNIR is behind a ?rewall that will not let\ncertain ports out. See Tor?s man page for more documentation.\n\nReturn Value: The routerstatus_t structure describing the chosen directory\nserver. The return value should be checked to see if it is NULL indicating an\nerror.\n\nNotes: The nickname should be either a trusted directory server (hard?coded\ninto the library) or a directory mirror. In order to download from a mirror,\nMJOLNIR must ?rst know which servers are mirrors, so it will have to make\nat least one request from an authoritative directory.\n\n0 int update_router_descriptors (void)\n\nDescription: Get the router descriptor data from a directory server.\nArguments: None.\nReturn Value: 0 on success; negative on failure.\n\nNotes: This function must be called every time the program needs to update\nits listing of routers. This must be done at least once before setting up any\ncircuits. It may be done an arbitrarily large number of times throughout the\nlife of the program, but each fetch will generate a sizable amount of traf?c to\none directory server.\n\nWarning: this function will always talk to one of the 5 directory servers hard?\ncoded into config.c:529 This behavior\nshould be able to be changed if the chosen directory server is a directory mirror.\nSee documentation for set_chosen_dirserver.\n\nWarning: This function is blocking. It will halt program execution until it\neither times out or receives a response. See the timeout documentation.\n\n0 char *get_routerdesc_string (void)\n\nDescription: Return the exact string that the server returns when MJOLNIR\nasks for the directory.\nArguments: None.\n\nReturn Value: A new copy of a string containing all router descriptors as\nreceived from the directory.\n\nNotes:\n\n0 (U) routerlist _t\n\nThe de?nition of routerlist _t is in or.h on lines 930?941. The most important ?eld\nis the smartlist routers which is a smartlist of routerinfo_t structures. The one part\n\n36\n\nTOP \n\nE.2\n\nTOP \n\nof these that will be used most often is probably the nickname ?eld. Let us assume\nthere is a routerlist named rlist. There are routers\navailable, and to access their nicknames, use rlist?>routers?>1ist ?>nickname.\nAlso see the documentation of \n\nrouterinfo_t\n\nThe function router_get_routerlist returns a smartlist of routerinfo_t structures\n(see above for more details). The most important ?elds of routerinfo_t are nick?\nname and the extend_info. Using this library, the programmer should never have to\ndeal directly with the internals of extend_info_t, and will probably never see it at\nall, but if the programmer want to add to the library, he will need to look over how\nit is used. The best place for a quick example is any of the attack functions detailed\nin controlmod. c.\n\n(U) routerlist_t *router_get_routerlist(void)\n\nDescription: Return the current list of all known routers.\n\nArguments: None.\n\nReturn Value: The list of all known routers. This list will not be populated\nuntil update_router_descriptors has run.\n\nNotes: See the routerlist_t documentation.\n\nvoid tor_cleanup (void)\n\nDescription: Cleans up before shutting Tor down.\n\nArguments: None.\n\nReturn Value: None.\n\nNotes: This must not be called unless no more Tor connections or services\nare needed. Calling tor_init after calling this function does not work yet. It\n\nseems that the problem with this is actually in shutting down and resetting the\nlibrary.\n\n(S SI) Circuit building\n(U) circuit_t\n\nThe only ?eld from this structure that the programmer needs to worry about is\nglobaLidenti?er. This identi?er is how the program keeps track of circuits it has\nbuilt, so if a program wants to have multiple circuits up at once, the programmer\nmust keep track of their respective global identi?ers or maintain a list of pointers to\nthe actual structures.\n\ncircuit_t (char \nbegin_router_nickname)\n\n37\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nDescription: Begin a new circuit that can be added to at any time so long\nas the following two conditions are met:\n\n1. The client is not one of the nodes in the circuit.\n\n2. The same node is not used twice in a row. (It can, however, be used twice\nin the same circuit.)\n\nNote that the ?rst of these is not checked in code, but in its current state, a\nclient using this library will never be a server, so this will not be an issue.\n\nArguments: begin_router_nickname: The nickname of the ?rst hop in the\nnew circuit.\n\nReturn Value: A pointer to the new circuit.\n\nNotes: This function must be called before attempting to append a new hop\nonto a circuit.\n\nWarning: This call is blocking.

It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\n0 int (char *nickname, circuit_t\n*circ)\nDescription: Append router with the given nickname to the given circuit.\nArguments:\n\n1. nickname: The nickname of the next hop in the circuit.\n2. circ: The circuit to which MJOLNIR should append a router.\n\nReturn Value: 0 on success; negative values on failure.\n\n38\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nNotes: Must get the circuit from \n\nWarning: This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\n0 routerinfo_t *get_random_router (routerinfo_t *exclude)\nDescription: This function gets a random router from the global router list\n\nso long as the chosen router is not the excluded one.\n\nArguments: exclude: Gives the programmer the option to exclude a certain\nrouter. It is most useful to exclude the most recently appended router in the\ncircuit, as the circuit dies if it tries to go to the same router twice in a row.\n\nReturn Value: Returns the routerinfo_t for the chosen router. This is\nprobably only useful for extending the current attacks, in which case it would\nbe useful to study those attacks carefully.\n\nNotes:\n0 int nickname_is_known (const char *nickname)\n\nDescription: This function checks to see that the nickname is a valid one.\nArguments: nickname: a string with the nickname of some router.\n\nReturn Value: Returns 1 if the router is valid; returns 0 otherwise. The\nrouter is valid if the program has routerstatus_t information about the router\nwith that nickname.\n\nNotes: The program may know about an invalid router. For example, the\nrouter may have been taken down since the router descriptor was fetched. How?\never, when MJOLNIR tries to connect a circuit, it will fail.\n\nvoid close_circuit(circuit_t **circ)\n\nDescription: Given an open circuit, close it, remove it from global_circuitlist,\nand de?allocate its memory. circ is NULL on return.\n\nArguments: circ: The circuit to be closed.\nReturn Value: None. However, circ is NULL so it can no longer be used.\n\nNotes:\n\nE.3 (U FOUO) Sending and receiving data\n\n0 int send_payload_down_circ(char *payload, size_t payload_len char\n*ip_addr, int port, circuit_t *circ, int force)\n\nDescription: This function sends a custom packet down the requested circuit\nto the speci?ed address at the speci?ed port.\n\n39\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nArguments:\n\n1. payload: the custom payload, e.g. an HTTP GET request.\n\n2. payloadJen: length of the payload.\n\n3. ip_addr: the IP address of the ultimate destination in form: 192.168.1.1\n(as a string).\n\n4. port: the destination port.\n\n5. circ: the circuit across which to send this packet.\n\n6. force: if true, the function will always try to send a payload. If false, it will\ncheck that the address is reachable with the current exit, and if it is not, it\nwill not send a payload.\n\nReturn Value: Return 0 on success; negative values on failure. If it refuses\nto send a packet because it was not forced, it returns failure.\n\nNotes: It is up to the calling program to check that both the payload and\nIP address:port are valid before calling this function. The payload_read_handler\nmust be set before this call is made.\n\nWarning: This call will block program execution until it times out or receives\na response.\n\n0 SI) payload_read_handler (function pointer):\nvoid (*payload_read_handler) (const char int)\n\nDescription: Function pointer to a user?de?ned function that gets called\nwhen the client receives a payload in response to its request.\n\nArguments:\n\n1. const char the payload that the client receives in response to its re?\nquest (what the calling program actually wants to read).\n\n2. int: length of the payload.\n\nReturn Value: Must return a void so the return value can be anything\nthe programmer wants.\n\nNotes: These functions should be de?ned by the user. To set this variable, call\nset_payload_read_handler (handler). Example functions (print _payload\nand do_nothing) are given in torm. c.\n\nTimeouts. MJOLNIR times out if it does not receive a response in a\ncertain amount of time. On the test LAN, we have it set to .1 s, which is more\nthan enough time. However, due to the slow nature of the Tor cloud, it may be\nnecessary to change the value of the initial timeout estimate. Our timeout fol?\nlows the TCP?style timeout rules, so once it has started receiving cells, it should\nadjust the timeout on its own. The constants that may need adjusting are in\ntimeout . c. In particular, look at and for\nthe number of seconds and microseconds, respectively, before it times out. See\nthe discussion in the section on sending and receiving data.\n\n40\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nint router_should_reach_addr (int addr, int port, routerinfo_t\n*router)\n\nDescription: The function checks the router?s exit policy and returns non?\nzero if the address is reachable and zero if the address is not reachable.\nArguments:\n\n1. addr: the address to reach, as an integer.\n2. port: the port to use at addr.\n3. router: the router to check.\n\nReturn Value: If is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\nNotes:\n\n0 int (char *ip_addr, int port,\nrouterinfo_t *router)\n\nDescription: This function checks the router?s exit policy and returns non?\nzero if the address is reachable and zero if the address is not reachable.\nArguments:\n\n1. ip_addr: the address to reach, as a string in form.\n2. port: the port to use at ip_addr.\n3. router: the router to check.\n\nReturn Value: If the ip_addr:port is reachable, it returns 1. If not, it returns\n0.\n\nNotes: This function just converts the string address to an integer and calls\nrouter_should_reach_addr.\nint circuit_should_reach_addr (int addr, int port, circuit_t *circ)\nDescription: MJOLNIR checks the exit policy of the Circuit?s exit hop and\nreturns non?zero if the address is reachable or zero if the address is unreachable.\nArguments:\n\n1. addr: the address to reach, as an integer.\n2. port: the port to use at addr.\n3. circ: the circuit want to check.\n\nReturn Value: If the is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\n\nNotes: This function just grabs the last hop in the circuit calls\nrouter_should_reach_addr.\n\nint (char *ip_addr, int port,\ncircuit_t *circ)\n\n41\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nDescription: MJOLNIR checks the exit policy of the Circuit?s exit hop and\nreturns non?zero if the address is reachable or zero if the address is unreachable.\n\nArguments:\n\n1. ip_addr: the address to reach, as a string in form.\n2. port: the port to use at ip_addr.\n3. circ: the circuit to check.\n\nReturn Value: If ip_addr:port is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\n\nNotes: This function just converts the string address to an integer and calls\ncircuit_should_reach_addr.\n\nE.4 (S SI) Smartlists and certi?cate masking\n0 (U) smartlist_t\n\nThe smartlist_t structure contains an array of void the number\nof elements used, and its total capacity. However, the programmer should never\nhave to deal with the internals directly. Instead, he should use smartlist_create,\nsmartlist_add, and We use this to de?ne custom X.509 cer?\nti?cates; it is nearly ubiquitous in the rest of the Tor code.\n\n0 (U) smartlist_t *smartlist_create (void)\n\nDescription: Allocate and return an empty smartlist.\n\nArguments: None.\n\nReturn Value: A pointer to the new smartlist.\n\nNotes: Any smartlist the programmer wants to use must ?rst be returned by\nthis function.\n\n0 (U) void smartlist_add (smartlist_t *sl, void *element)\n\nDescription: Appends an element to the end of the list.\n\nArguments: sl is the smartlist that is receiving the element. It must have\nbeen returned by smartlist_create.\n\nReturn Value: None.\n\nNotes: Technically, a smartlist may contain pointers to different kinds of ob?\njects, though this is highly unrecommended. Individual elements of the smartlist\nmay be accessed through its list, e.g. sl->list .\n\n0 (U) void smartlist_remove (smartlist_t *sl, void *element)\n\nDescription: Removes the element from the list.\n\n42\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nArguments: sl is the smartlist that is losing the element. sl must have been\nreturned by smartlist_create.\n\nReturn Value: None.\n\nNotes: Preserves the order of any elements before element, but elements after\nit may be rearranged.\n\n(smartlist, type, var, code)\n\nDescription: is a macro that will run code for every\nelement in a smartlist. All elements of the smartlist must be of the given type.\n\nArguments:\n\n1. smartlist: The smartlist over which MJOLNIR runs the code.\n2. type: The type of data held by the smartlist.\n\n3. var: The variable name by which the macro access the elements of the\nsmartlist. The variable does not need to be declared before being used.\n\n4. code: The code to be executed. If there is more than one statement, it\nshould be in curly braces.\n\nReturn Value: None.\n\nNotes: Remember that this is a macro. If the code is bracketed, it must be\nfollowed the closing brace with a right parenthesis and semicolon.\n\n?eld_value_pair_t\n\n(TS SI) This is a very simple structure containing two strings: a ?eld and a value.\nThese should be allocated and set as any other strings. In the example program, this\nstructure is added to a smartlist so that MJOLNIR can use custom X.509 certi?cates.\n\n0 (TS SI) Subject and issuer smartlists (smartlist_t)\n\n(TS SI) Tor uses self?signed X.509 certi?cates during its TLS handshake. By de?\nfault, it sends only commonName (normally the client or server?s nickname) and\norganizationName (normally the string for both subject and issuer, with\nthe only difference being that the issuer common name is followed by the string\n?<identity> \n\nSI) A Tor server will check for required X.509 ?elds, but not anything else\nexcept the subject?s commonName, and the only restrictions are that the length is\ngreater than 0 and it consists of alphanumeric characters. (The commonName can\nalso contain a period, but this creates a log message on the other server. Currently,\nMJOLNIR treats the period as an illegal character.) These lists allow the program?\nmer to send any X.509 certi?cate he wishes, instead of always sending the same ones.\nIf there is no commonName in the subject section, the client will generate a random\nstring of characters 10?20 bytes long to act as the commonName.\n\n43\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nSI) If the commonName has an illegal character, MJOLNIR will generate a\nrandom one. If MJOLNIR receives as input an invalid X.509 ?eld, it will ignore that\n?eld/value pair entirely. In this way, MJOLNIR provides relatively robust X.509\ncerti?cate generation.\n\n(TS SI) The programmer must create two smartlists of ?eld_value_pair_t struc?\ntures (one each for subject and issuer) where the ?eld variable is the name of the\n?eld in the certi?cate and value is set to the appropriate string. These two smartlists\nmust then be passed to init_keys (subject ?rst, issuer second).\n\n(TS SI) See the documentation for smartlist_t, ?eld_value_pair_t, smartlist_add,\nsmartlist_create, and init_keys.\n\nE.5 DOS-style attacks\n\nSI) The purpose of these attacks is not actual per se. These simply do not\ngenerate enough traf?c. However, they may be able to generate suf?cient traf?c to force a\nnode into hibernation, which takes the server out of the Tor cloud until the next hibernation\nperiod begins (could be a day, week, or month).\n\n0 circuit_t *flower_attack_one_router (char *routernick, int num_petals)\n\nDescription: Set up a network attack on one Tor node. The program\nwill create a circuit consisting of random routers alternating with the given\nrouter. This results in the given router doing much more work than the rest of\nthe nodes on the circuit.\n\nArguments:\n\n1. routernick: the nickname of the router to attack.\n\n2. num_petals: he number of times the attacked router will be in the resultant\ncircuit. Therefore, the circuit will be 2 num_petals long.\n\nReturn Value: A pointer to the circuit_t structure of the newly?formed\ncircuit.\n\nNotes: When setting up a circuit with hops, the client must send 72 cells\nalong the circuit. So setting up a large circuit can be very time?consuming, as\nwell as expensive with regards to both traf?c generated and CPU time used.\nWarning: This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established. For even a moderately long circuit, this can\ntake a substantial amount of time.\n\ncircuit_t *append_flower_to_circuit (char *routernickl,\nint num_petals, circuit_t *circ)\n\nDescription: Similar to append_coil_to_circuit, this function appends a\n?ower to the end of the given circuit. Using this, MJOLNIR is anonymized by\nthe structure of the Tor cloud.\n\n44\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nArguments:\n\n1. routernick] The router in the middle of the ?ower.\n\n2. num_petals: The number of times the middle router appears in the ?ower.\nSo the ?ower will be 2 num_petals long.\n\n3. circ: The original circuit to append the new ?ower to.\nReturn Value: The circuit with the ?ower added.\n\nNotes: See the ?ower attack documentation.\n\n0 circuit_t *coil_attack_two_routers(char *routernickl,\nchar *routernick2, int num_coils)\n\nDescription: Similar to the ?ower attack, except that this function generates\na circuit that bounces back and forth between two nodes in the Tor cloud instead\nof targeting only one router.\n\nArguments:\n\n1. routernick] nickname of the ?rst attacked router.\n\n2. routernick2: nickname of the second attacked router; if MJOLNIR sends a\npayload down this circuit, the second router will be the ?nal one.\n\n3. num_coils: the number of times each router will appear in the circuit. So\nthe circuit is actually 2 num_coils long.\nReturn Value: A pointer to the newly?formed circuit.\nNotes: See the notes under flower_attack_one_router; the same applies\nhere.\n\nWarning: This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established.\n\n0 circuit_t *append_coil_to_circuit (char *routernickl,\nchar *routernick2, int num_coils, circuit_t *circ)\n\nDescription: Similar to the coil attack, but puts the coil at the end of a\ngiven circuit. Using this, MJOLNIR is anonymized by the structure of the Tor\ncloud.\n\nArguments:\n\n1. routernick] the ?rst router in the coil.\n2. routernick2: the second router in the coil.\n\n3. num_coils: The number of times each router appears in the coil. The\nresulting circuit will be as long as circ plus 2 num_coils.\n\n4. circ: The circuit to which MJOLNIR appends the coil.\n\nReturn Value: the newly?formed circuit.\n\n45\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nNotes: See the documentation for the coil attack.\n\nWarning: This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\nMJOLNIR for Windows\n\nF.1 (U) Interface\n\n(TS SI) The GUI provides the user with a list of all the circuits created by the client.\nThe list displays relevant information about each circuit, including its length, state, and\npurpose. Additionally, each circuit has an light icon next to its name. The light is red if\nthe circuit is closed (cannot be used). The light is green if the circuit is open and ready\nfor use. Beneath the circuit list, a list of the servers in a circuit is displayed for the last\ncircuit clicked. Similar to the circuits, the servers each have a light next to their names to\nindicate whether the circuit is open up to that server. The displays for the circuit list and\nthe node list are set to update on a timer (currently set to three seconds.) On the right,\nthe GUI provides a list of servers that are available for use in a circuit. The router list\ndoes not update on the timer. To update the router list, the user must click the ?Load\nRouters? button.\n\nF.2 Creating new circuits\n\n(TS SI) The GUI provides a few different ways to create new circuits. The most general\nway to create a new circuit is to click the ?New Circuit? button. This will create a\nnull circuit with a user?speci?ed name and purpose (see the Tor documentation for more\ninformation on circuit purpose.) The user can then proceed to build a circuit by appending\nservers individually to the end of the circuit. Alternatively, the user can create a random\ncircuit of arbitrary length by clicking the ?New Random Circuit? button. The user then\nspeci?es a name and length n, and MJOLNIR will choose 72 random servers from the\navailable router list and create a new circuit. Currently, all random circuits are made with\n?General? purpose. Modifying the program so that the user can specify the purpose of a\nrandom circuit only requires a minor change at the library level. However, it is likely that\ncreating circuits of certain purposes will cause the program to crash (see below.) Circuits\ncan also be created using the coil or ?ower attacks (see section 7.1, DOS-Style Attacks.)\n(TS SI) To append a server to a circuit, the user must ?rst select the desired circuit\nby clicking on its name in the circuit list. This causes the chosen circuit to become current,\nwhich means it is the circuit whose node list is currently displayed. Then the user right?\nclicks on the name of the desired server in the router list and selects ?Append to Current\nCircuit.? Any ?General? purpose circuit that is open can have a server appended to it.\n(TS SI) It should be noted that circuits created with certain purposes cannot have\nservers appended to them, and trying to do so will crash the program. Currently, only\n?General?, ?Introducing?, and ?Establish Rend? circuits are able to have servers appended\n\n46\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIi. \nhim-?air\nI I  ll-nw- I \nII -4 .

Once a server is appended to an ?Establish Rend? circuit, its purpose becomes\n?Rend Ready? (a one?hop circuit to a rendezvous point) and attempting to append any\nmore servers will cause a crash. This will need to be cleaned up as functionality for creating\nrendezvous circuits and accessing hidden services is added.\n\nF.3 DOS-style attacks\n\n(TS SI) The GUI provides an interface for performing the coil and ?ower attacks\nfrom the MJOLNIR library. In the coil attack, the user chooses two servers to attack and\nthe number of coils in the circuit. Each server appears once in the circuit for each coil, so\nthe length of the circuit will be twice the number of coils. For the ?ower attack, the user\nchooses a server to attack and the number of petals, where the number of petals is the\nnumber of times the selected server will appear in the circuit.\n\n(TS SI) For both attacks, the user has the option to create the coil or ?ower as a\nnew circuit or to append it to an existing circuit. However, appending coils or ?owers is\nmore expensive than creating them as new circuits, and there is a signi?cant performance\nhit for appending large coils and ?owers to circuits.\n\nF.4 (TS SI) Sending arbitrary packets\n\n(TS SI) To send a packet through a circuit, the user ?rst clicks the ?Send Packet? button.\nThen the user selects a circuit to send the message through, and an IP address and port\nnumber to send the message to. The user has the option of entering the payload of the\npacket in either hex or ASCII. Upon clicking ?Send?, the packet is with the\nappropriate layers of and sent through the circuit. The exit server will then\nsend the packet to the selected IP address and destination port.\n\n47\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n \n\nFigure 4: The coil attack dialog.\n\n1.5mm}\n- un.l.u.l\n\n \n\nFigure 5: Sending a custom TCP packet using the MJOLNIR GUI.\n\n48\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nF.5 (U) Future features\n\n0 Customizing the certi?cates.

PERSONS\n\nr. (U) PURPOSE\n\na.\n\nII.\n\nThis agreement between NSA and The Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU) prescribes\nprocedures and responsibilities for ensuring that ISNU handling of materials provided by NSA including, but\nnot limited to. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) technology and equipment and raw SIGINT data signals\nintelligence information that has not been reviewed for foreign intelligence purposes or minimized) is\nconsistent with the requirements placed upon NSA by US. law and Executive Order to establish safeguards\nprotecting the rights of US. persons under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThis agreement will apply to any SIGINT raw traffic, technology, or enabling that NSA may\nprovide to ISNU. This agreement applies only to materials provided by NSA and shall not be construed to\napply to materials collected independently by ISNU.\n\nISNU also recognizes that NSA has agreements with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the\nUnited Kingdom that require it to protect information associated with UK. persons, Australian persons,\nCanadian persons and New Zealand persons using procedures and safeguards similar to those applied for US.\npersons. For this reason, in all uses of raw material provided by NSA, ISNU agrees to apply the procedures\noutlined in this agreement to persons of these countries.\n\n(U) This agreement is not intended to create any legally enforceable rights and shall not be construed to be\neither an international agreement or a legally binding instrument according to international law.\n\n(U) DEFINITIONS\n\nREL) Raw SIGINT is any SIGINT acquired either as a result of search and development, or targeted\ncollection operations against a particular foreign intelligence target before the information has been evaluated\nfor foreign intelligence and minimized. Raw SIGINT includes, but is not limited to, unevaluated and\nunminimized transcripts, gists. facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) metadata and\ncontent. \n\nMinimization is the process used to determine whether US. person information encountered in\nraw SIGINT is essential to assess or understand the significance of the foreign intelligence. The NSA Special\nUS Liaison Advisor Israel (SUSLAIS) should be consulted any time US. person information is found in raw\nSIGINT data supplied by NSA.\n\n(U) A US. Person is:\nl) (U) a citizen of the United States;\n\n2) (U) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States (informally referred to as a\n?green card\" holder);\n\nTOP TO USA. ISR\n\nIkll? DEL 1? 1U \n\n(U) an unincorporated group or association, a substantial number of the members of which constitute \nor (2) above: or\n\n4) (U) a company incorporated within the United States, including U.S.?flagged non-govemmental aircraft\nor vessels. but not including those entities which are openly acknowledged by a foreign government or\ngovernments to be directed and controlled by them.\n\n5) (U) Additionally, a person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a person?\nunless that person is reasonably identified as an alien who has not been admitted for permanent\nresidence. or if the nature of the person?s communications or other information in the contents or\ncircumstances of such communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a U.S.\nperson. Any person located outside the United States will be treated as a non-U.S. person unless there is\na reasonable belief that such person is a U.S. person.\n\n(U) BACKGROUND\n\na. NSA routinely sends ISNU minimized and unminimized raw collection associated with\nselectors from multiple Target Office Primary Interest (TOPI) of?ces in Analysis and Production, 82 as part of\nthe SIGINT relationship between the two organizations. This mutually agreed upon exchange has been\nbeneficial to both and mission and intelligence requirements.\n\nb. NSA and ISNU have previously discussed the protection of US. Person information, in relation\nto tasking joint collection operations. and agreed in principle to not task communications of U.S. citizens. The\nproposal to share unminimized raw collection requires additional procedures to meet formal requirements.\n\nIn March 2009. ISNU was given an overview briefing during the Raw Material conference and agreed. in\nprincipal to protect U.S. Person intonnation. It was determined that more formalized training is needed. The\ndate of this training is TBD.\n\nIV. (U) RESPONSIBILITIES\na. (U) NSA shall:\n1) EL) Provide an annual review and training of these procedures with ISNU.\n\n2) Regularly review a sample of files transferred to ISNU to validate the absence of U.S.\nPersons identities.\n\nb. (U) ISNU shall:\n\nI) Not use any technology or equipment that is furnished under the accommodation\nprocurement process to intentionally target communications to, from, or about U.S. Persons\nanywhere in the world or intentionally target any person meeting the de?nition ofa U.S. Person\nprovided in Section II above.\n\nNot use any information provided by NSA. as raw material or otherwise. to intentionally\n\nintercept the communications to, from or about a US. person. ?Intercept? means the use of words or\nphrases. such as a name, number or answerback. address, telephone number, email address or any\n\nTOP TO USArL\\ll\\IIl\\l I\\l \n\ncombination of such terms, to acquire non?public communications. It applies to both electronic and\nmanual acquisition, including follow-on queries of stored communications.\n\nStrictly limit access to storage systems containing raw SIGINT provided by NSA\nexclusively to properly cleared ISNU personnel and to properly cleared members of Israeli Intelligence\nservices who ISNU has determined have a strict need to know. Access will be limited to those\nindividuals who have been trained in the aforementioned procedures.\n\nDisseminate foreign intelligence information concerning U.S. persons derived from raw\nSIGINT provided by NSA to include any release outside ISNU in the form of reports, transcripts.\ngists. rnemoranda, or any other form of written or oral document or transmission only in a manner\nthat does not identify the .8. person.

This budget represents a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 2.4 percent, below the FY 2012 enacted\nlevel; and it reduces personnel by 1,241 positions, or one percent. The request meets the fiscal demands laid out\nin the Budget Control Act by setting the IC on a path to reduce expenditures by $25 billion for ten years; with\nover $15 billion of that amount saved by FY 2017.\n\n(U) Developing a Balanced Intelligence Budget\n\n(S) The IC leadership worked as a corporate body to develop the budget. The team first drew on lessons learned\nfrom the drawdown in the 1990s, which left the IC with a distorted workforce that lacked sufficient mid?career\npersonnel and technical expertise. As a result of that drawdown, the IC reverted to extraordinary measures to\nrebuild and balance the workforce. Moreover, we deferred infrastructure recapitalization, resulting in obsolete\nfacilities, single point failures, and inadequate power, space, and cooling. We also delayed investment, reducing\nour ability to keep pace with technical advances to meet mission needs.\n\n(U) Second, we looked forward to determine how best to meet increasing mission requirements over the next\ndecade in a resource?constrained environment. The IC leadership weighed the relative merit of capabilities and\nlooked at dependencies across the components. In addition, we coordinated Closely with the Defense and domestic\ndepartments to minimize disconnects and ensure balance.\n\n(S) At the outset, I determined that we would not take a proportional reduction from each IC program, but\nrather compare relative merits of programs. We carefully weighed cost and risk to understand both the short\nand long term impact of our actions. To maximize investments for the future, we focused reductions on lower\npriority capabilities; sought efficiencies and smarter ways to do business; and prudently accepted risk. Overall,\nthis budget is guided by the imperative to achieve the right balance against competing demands. Our guiding\nprinciples were to:\n\n0 (U) Sustain a skilled workforce;\n\n0 (U) Focus on further integration and collaboration;\n\n(U) Bolster agile capabilities that support multiple missions;\n\n(S) Enhance counterintelligence; and\n\n(U) Protect key investment for the future.\n\nTOP 1\n\nTOP \n\n(U) Reductions\n\n(U) To the extent possible, we protected the activities highlighted above; but with the magnitude of the\nreduction, we could not avoid limited, targeted cuts to priority areas. The following are some activities reduced\nfrom the base budget plan:\n\nF) Sustained Congressional Cuts. We sustain FY 2012 cuts to the Global Deployment Initiative\nand Integrated Ground Architecture.\n\n(S) Workforce. We continue Congressional reductions to the government workforce; curtail plans for future\npersonnel growth, and take targeted reductions to baseline personnel where the risk can be managed.\nFurthermore, we re?ect savings from a lower than projected Civilian pay raise and continue to reduce our\nreliance on core contractors.\n\nOperations. We decrease collection, production, and hard copy media generation in the GEOINT\nsystem, slow SIGINT network exploitation and processing modernization; cut GDIP HUMINT, non?core\nMASINT, covert action programs, and some Specialized Reconnaissance Programs (SRP) operations;\nand streamline the ODNI business transformation activities. Furthermore, we discontinue or terminate\nsome lower?priority missions, such as de?orbiting the Baseline ONYX satellite and transferring funding\nresponsibility to the MIP for legacy satellites.\n\nLong-Term Investments. We are terminating an NRO compartmented project, delaying\nTOPAZ performance enhancements until the second generation of TOPAZ satellites; and reducing\ntechnology insertion opportunities in other satellites. In addition, we are delaying some SRP investments\nand terminating the Community?s investment in a consolidated human resources information system.\n\nInfrastructure. We reduce enterprise management activities; eliminate the IC Data Center;\ndownsize the IC Bethesda Campus; suspend some facility improvements; and delay the replacement of\naged facility components. As a result, we will continue to house some of the IC workforce in older and less\ncapable facilities that may not meet current antiterrorism/force protection requirements and we will accept\nsome degradation in the facility condition index.\n\nF) Information Technology. We reduce capital equipment replacement and recapitalization; decrease\nsupport for heritage systems; delay consolidation of older systems; and eliminate plans for additional backup\nsystems. These offsets prevent spending to sustain or improve legacy environments when our direction is\nto establish a new IT environment based on more centralized common services. Investments required to\nestablish a more efficient IC IT Enterprise are protected.\n\n(U) Investments\n\n(U) Although the budget is declining, the mission is not. Prioritizing our requirements was a key element to\nproduce a budget that meets customer needs, supports critical capabilities, addresses gaps, and helps to maintain\na strategic advantage. In the FY 2013 NIP budget, the IC makes targeted investments in:\n\nSignals Intelligence (SIGINT). We are bolstering our support for Clandestine SIGINT\ncapabilities to collect against high priority targets, including foreign leadership targets. Also, we are\ninvesting in groundbreaking capabilities to defeat adversarial and exploit\ninternet traffic.\n\nCybersecurity. As the cyber threat continues to grow, we sustain the budget for the Comprehensive\n\nNational Cybersecurity Initiative and begin construction of a second High Performance Computing Center\nat Fort Meade, Maryland to keep pace with cyber processing demands.\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nF) Counterintelligence (CI). To further safeguard our Classified networks, we continue to strengthen\ninsider threat detection capabilities across the Community. In addition, we are investing in target\nsurveillance and offensive CI against key targets, such as China, Russia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and Cuba.\n\n0 F) Major System Acquisitions (MSA). We are sustaining the acquisition baseline and maintaining\nthe schedule for the MSAs that replace current capabilities. For example, the RO is modernizing overhead\nSIGIN T, geospatial, and communications major system acquisitions. To reduce reliance on the Tracking and\nData Relay Satellite System the NRO begins investing in a special communications capability.\nAlso, launch requirements are fully funded.\n\nBallistic Missile Collection. We are pursuing an affordable MASINT solution for integrating,\nimproving, and sustaining coverage of and collection against North Korean, Iranian, Chinese, Russian,\nPakistani and other ballistic missiles threats.\n\n0 Mission Focused Science Technology We continue investing in cutting edge that\nenables new mission capabilities. We are tackling hard problems in quantum computing, biometrics, cyber,\nweapons of mass destruction, and large complex data sets.\n\n(U) Optimizing Our Efforts\n\n(U) To succeed, the IC must employ its resources judiciously. The need to integrate all elements of the IC\nis essential to identify opportunities as well as dangers. In FY 2011, the elimination of Usama Bin Ladin along\nwith 32 other high value targets is just one testament to IC collaboration. Our ability to rapidly respond to\nthe requirements of Operation Unified Endeavor, while simultaneously maintaining support for operations in\nAfghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, is another. We achieved this by reducing the cultural, technological and\npolicy barriers to sharing information, and exploring new strategies for integrating our intelligence efforts. The\nFY 2013 budget sustains the imperative of integration, and provides the framework and common solutions to\nfurther collaboration.\n\n(U) Focusing on Integration\n\n(U) The Office of the DNI has promoted information sharing and collaboration through the integration of\nanalysis and collection at the strategic level. This has improved mission management of key intelligence problems,\nleading to a sharper focus on, and encouragement of, integration within the Community. The heightened attention\non intelligence integration has Changed the dynamics of intelligence activities. Without requiring individual IC\nelements to reorganize, the emphasis on integration has led Community elements to think and operate in ways\nthat are responsive to strategic management and direction that encourages, recognizes, and rewards integrated\nintelligence operations.\n\nThe National Intelligence Managers (NIM) are the principal agents of mission integration. They\noversee and integrate all aspects of the efforts against a particular regional or functional problem to provide a\nmore complete understanding of the associated issues. A major responsibility includes the development, planning,\nexecution, and oversight of Unifying Intelligence Strategies (UIS) for their individual accounts, with the principal\naim of managing the relevant policies, priorities, and relationships among the IC elements who participate in\neach of these target domains.\n\nThese UIS are the instruments that are used to integrate IC efforts against critical priorities. Each\nUIS supports decision?making by outlining gaps and Challenges, as well as opportunities that would most benefit\nfrom integration of IC efforts. In addition, the UIS present a select number of integration initiatives to provide\na holistic perspective across the strategies.\n\nTOP 3\n\nTOP \n\n(U) Promoting Information Sharing\n\n(U) Information sharing also is a critical enabler of integration across the Community. This budget begins to\nimplement a restructuring of the IC information technology (IT) architecture that will provide a strong backbone\nenabling greater IC integration, information sharing, and improved safeguarding of networks. The need for the\nIC to contribute to deficit reduction was the catalyst for achieving greater efficiencies in information technology.\nThe IC IT Enterprise will transform from agency?centric IT programs which are often duplicative and costly, to\ngreater centralization of common services for IC?wide use. Within this framework, we are leveraging existing\nefforts across the Community and sustaining unique approaches only when they are essential to the mission.\nFurthermore, we are investigating data management solutions and their associated security issues, such as the\nviability of comingling data in virtualized data stores to facilitate analytical integration of different data from\ndifferent sources and Agencies. This includes new management and operating practices for the secure storage and\nhandling of the varied information contained in different intelligence systems through the use of Cloud computing.\n\n(U) Engaging Partners\n\n(U) Expanding the culture of sharing with our partners is essential to leverage and maximize our collective\ncapabilities. We are strengthening relationships with federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners to fuse\ndomestic and foreign intelligence to quickly understand and act on threats. Through coordinated efforts, we can\noptimize our efforts to improve intelligence support.\n\n(U) As part of the Administration's overall foreign trade initiative, the IC will more Closely coordinate its\nintelligence gathering and analysis efforts with federal agencies responsible for monitoring foreign trade barriers\nand enforcing US. trade rights under international trade agreements. The IC will directly support and strengthen\nU.S. interagency trade enforcement efforts to address unfair trade practices through the World Trade Organization\nand under other domestic and international trade enforcement authorities\n\n(U) Furthermore, the IC is postured to support the warfighter as the Department of Defense implements a new\nstrategy. The strategy is consistent with the IC approach to the FY 2013 budget. We will support the increased\nfocus on the Pacific region, and surge as needed for military operations. In addition, we expect there will be a\ngreater reliance on the IC to provide global coverage and warning of emerging threats.\n\n(U) Aligning Resources\n(U) This year, the IC implemented guiding principles to clarify responsibility for programming NIP resources.\n\n(S) The IC developed guidelines to more Clearly delineate programming responsibility for the NIP and the\nMIP to further optimize resource allocation. These guidelines better align NIP and MIP resources with mission\nrequirements, reduce the number of split funded projects, and enable more efficient budget execution. The\nFY 2013 budget begins to implement the guidelines by transferring $165 million and 1,078 positions between\nthe NIP and MIP. This transfer maintains the mission, function, and execution of activities; it does n_ot represent\ngrowth in either program.\n\n(S) In addition, the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis implemented a Change in how it accounts\nfor resources that support the intelligence mission. Beginning in the FY 2013 budget, activities that predominately\nsupport departmental missions are funded outside the NIP. Under the new methodology, $11 million and\n44 positions are transferred out of the NIP.\n\n(U) Supporting Current Intelligence Operations\nIn FY 2013, the IC will continue to provide crucial intelligence support to military operations in\nAfghanistan and to combat terrorism worldwide.\n\nThe request for Afghanistan and Pakistan decreases as support for the military?s counterterrorism\nand counterinsurgency operations declines, coincident with planned troop reductions. Accordingly, this request\nsustains HUMINT and CI operations, along with the related analytic, processing, and exploitation capabilities.\n\n4 TOP \n\nTOP \n\nAlso, SA is augmenting SIGINT access and penetration, and Treasury enhances threat finance analysis to track\nterrorist and insurgent networks.\n\nWith the completion of the military drawdown in Iraq, intelligence support transitions to a smaller\nlong?term presence. The request is significantly reduced from FY 2012 as our support focuses on providing\nforeign intelligence in support of diplomatic activities and monitoring Iraq?s plans and intentions and those of its\nvolatile neighbor, Iran. This budget sustains HUMINT operations, with a smaller footprint, as well as SIGINT\ncollection capabilities. Most support for media exploitation, commercial imagery, and other operational enablers\nis eliminated.\n\nThe counterterrorism (CT) mission requires a global perspective to predict, penetrate, and preempt\nglobal threats to US. security. Therefore, the IC is sustaining operations, analytic, and enabling activities. With\nYemen, Somalia, and other Horn of Africa countries emerging as the most recent breeding ground for terrorism,\nthe IC is increasing efforts in those regions. Furthermore, we are sustaining CT capabilities in Libya to deny\nextremists a safe haven. In an effort to reduce our reliance on OCO as a funding vehicle, we transfer to the base\nsome enduring long term activities.\n\nThe counterproliferation (CP) mission continues to support a variety of actions to deter, disrupt, and\nprevent proliferation. This includes improving our understanding of Pakistani nuclear weapons and dangerous\nnuclear material security; intelligence on proliferators, such as Iran and North Korea, to roll back and block\nweapons programs; increasing our ability to ascertain global Chemical and biological threats; and better\nintegrating multidiscipline coverage of WMD targets such as Chemical weapons in Libya and Syria.\n\n(U) Moving Forward\n\nF) Today?s national security threats virtually defy rank?ordering. Capabilities, technologies, know?how,\ncommunications, and environmental forces are not confined by borders, and can trigger transnational disruptions\nwith astonishing speed. Never before has the IC been called upon to master such complexity and so many issues\nin such a resource?constrained environment. We are rising to the Challenge by continuing to integrate the IC,\ncapitalize on new technologies, implement new efficiencies, and, as always, remaining vigilant 24/7 worldwide.\n\nThe pressure to maintain the world?s premier intelligence enterprise in the face of shrinking\nbudgets will be difficult. We will accept and manage risk, more so than we?ve had to in the last decade.\n\nThis NIP budget proposed is balanced and executable. It does not re?ect the potential for a\nsequester in January 2013. Instead, the FY 2013 President?s Budget proposes savings in other areas that exceed\nthe Joint Committee threshold, and as a result seeks to cancel the automatic reductions and restore the caps to\nthe original definitions in the Budget Control Act.\n\n(U) Intelligence is the first line of defense. This budget provides the programs and initiatives vital to our\nnational security. Our partnership with you our Congressional oversight committees is critical to our\ncollective success. With your continued support, the IC can continue to fulfill our mission to keep America and\nits interests secure.\n\n(Mama?\n\nTOP 5\n\nTOP \n\n \n\n \n\nFY 2013 Mission Objective Funding*\n\n$52.0 Billion\n\nCIARDS funding not included.\n\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\nEnhance\nCybersecurity\n8%\nIntegrate\nCounterintelligence\n7%\n\nCombat Violent\nExtremism\n\n33%\nProvide Strategic\nIntelligence and Warning\n39%\nCounter Weapons\nProliferation\n13%\nM06: Support to Current Operations is covered in other MO sections.\nFigure 1.\nThis Figure is \n\n \n\nTOP \n\n \n\nTOP \n\n \n\n \n\nFY 2011 Intelligence Community Civilian Workforce\n\nGrade Distribution by Average Age\n\n \n\n30,000 75\n25,000 \n60\nU)\nI\n\n:3 20,000 5,000 I a:\nO.) \n3 10,000 I 2\n\n\n5,000 15\n\n0\n\n \n\nGrade GS 7-10 GS 11-12 GS-15 Payband Payband Payband Payband Payband SES\n\n6 Below\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nI Average Age Average Years of Service\n\n \n\nPercentage of Workforce\n\n \n\nGrade byYears of Service\n\n>35\n31-34\n26-30\n21-25\n16-20\n11-15\n6-10\n1-5\n\nGrade GS 7-10 GS 11-12 GS13-14 G815 Payband Payband Payband Payband Payband SES\n\n6 Below\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nNote: This chart contains data adjusted to facilitate display in whole percentages only and some categories with will display as Actual percentages are available upon request.\n\nThis Figure is \n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n \n\nTOP \n\n67\n\n \n\nTOP \n\n \n\nFY 2011 Intelligence Community Civilian Workforce\n\nYears to Optional Retirement\n\nAnalysis Production\nCollection Operations\n\nEnterprise IT\n\n3*\n\n01 .\n9 Enterprise \n8\nMission \n'o\n5\nProcessing Exp\n\nResearch &Tech\n\nTotal\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nPercentage of Workforce\n\nIRet.Elig.

Regarding the FAA collection\nprograms, the Court cited targeting and minimization procedures related to collection of\nMultiple Communications Transactions as ?de?cient on statutory and comtitutional\ngrounds.? Teclurology Directorate, CIGC, and other organisations are coordinating a\nresponse, which includes planning to implement a conservative solution in which the\nhigher-risk collection will he sequestered- It is possible that this higher risk collection\ncontains much of the non-duplicative FAA collection resulting in FAA reporting ??om\nupstream accesses. This solution is designed to comply with the judge?s order, however,\nthe judge will have to determine if it does. If the solution is installed, will then work\nwith DPIs and DIS-C to modify the solution over time such that the ?ltering process will\nbe optimized to permit more valid collection to be processed and forwarded to DFls.\nFinally, in parallel with these efforts, the DOC is contemplating ?ling an appeal to the\nruling.\n\n"

(U) Overview\n\nThe attached NSAW SID Intelligence Oversight (IO) Quarterly Report for the First Quarter\nCalendar Year 2012 (1 January 31 March 2012) identifies NSAW SID compliance with EC. 12333, \nRegulation Policy 1?23, USSID SP0018, and all related policies and regulations.\n\nDetailed incident narratives are provided in the attached annexes. The number of incidents in\neach category and a reference to the annex related to each incident category are contained in the body of the\nreport.\n\nAs part of SID Oversight and Compliance?s (SV) charge to provide comprehensive trends and\nanalysis information as it pertains to incidents of non?compliance, this Executive Summary provides analysis\nand evaluation of incidents reported throughout the current quarter to better address the ?whys? and ?hows?\nbehind NSAW compliance posture.\n\nSection II, Metrics, has been broken down into several sub?sections: metrics and analysis of\nNSAW SID?reported incidents by authority, type, root cause, and organization. Also included is an assessment\nof how incidents were discovered methods of discovery) for SID?reported incidents (see Figure 7).\n\nSignificant Incidents of Non?compliance and Report Content follow in Sections and IV,\nrespectively.\n\nOverall, the number of incidents reported during 1QCY12 increased by 11% as compared to the\nnumber of incidents reported during 4QCY11. This included a rise in the number of EC. 12333 incidents, as\nwell as for incidents across all FISA authorities. The majority of incidents in all authorities were database\nquery incidents due to human error. Of note, S2 continued to be the NSAW SID organization with the largest\nnumber of reported incidents although S2 experienced an overall decrease in reported incidents. SV\nnoted an overall improvement in timeliness regarding 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report submissions from the SID\nelements.\n\nPage 1 of 13\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\n \n\n11. (U) Metrics\na.

From\n4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an overall increase in incidents of 11%. There was also an increase of 11% for\nboth E.O. 12333 and FISA incidents. The increase in incidents reported for 1QCY12 was due to an increase in\nthe number of reported Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) roamer1 incidents, which may be\nattributed to an increase in Chinese travel to visit friends and family for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nFigure 1a: Table of the Number of NSAW SID?reported Incidents by Authority\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n2QCY11 3QCY11 4QCY11 1QCY12\nE.O. 12333 396 390 601 670\nFISA 150 198 176 195\nTOTAL 546 588 777 865\n\nFigure 1b: Line Graph of the Number of NSAW SID?reported Incidents by Authority\n\n800\n700\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12333\nL:\n?g 300 -I-FISA\n2QCY11 3QCY11 4QCY11 1QCY12\nQuarter \n\nFISA Incidents: As re?ected in Figures 1a-b, during 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total\nof 195 FISA incidents, 185 of which were associated with unintentional collection.

Figure 2 illustrates the most common root causes for incidents involving FISA authorities\nas determined by SV.\n\n0 63% (123) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to Operator Error as the root cause, and\ninvolved:\n0 Resources inaccurate or insufficient research information and/or workload issues \n0 Lack of due diligence failure to follow standard operating procedures) \n0 Human error (21) which encompassed:\nBroad syntax no or insufficient limiters defeats parameters) \nI Typographical error \nQuery technique understood but not applied and\nIncorrect option selected in tool and\n0 Training and guidance training issues) (3).\n\nThe Resources root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of Operator Error\nincidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. Analysis identified that these incidents could be reduced if\nhad more complete and consistent information available about selectors and/or targets at the time of\ntasking and if consistently applied rules for conducting queries.\n\n0 37% (72) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to System Error as the root cause, and\ninvolved:\n0 System limitations system lacks the capability to ?push? real?time travel data out to\nsystem/device unable to detect changes in user) \n0 System engineering system/database developed without the appropriate oversight\nmeasures, data ?ow issues, etc.) and,\n0 System disruptions glitches, bugs, etc.) (1).\n\nThe System Limitations root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of System\nError incidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. The largest number of incidents in the System Limitations\ncategory account for roamers where there was no previous indications of the planned travel. These incidents are\nlargely unpreventable. Consistent discovery through the Visitor Location Register (VLR) occurs every quarter\nand provides with timely information to place selectors into candidate status or detask. Analysis\nidentified that these incidents could be reduced if removed/detasked selectors more quickly upon\nlearning that the status of the selector had changed and more regularly monitored target activity. This analysis\nindicates that continued research on ways to exploit new technologies and researching the various aspects of\npersonal communications systems to include GSM, are an important step for NSA to track the travel of\nvalid foreign targets.\n\nPage 3 of 13\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nFigure 2: 1QCY12 FISA Incidents Root Causes\n\n\nOperator Human Error (21)\nOperator Due Diligence (39)\n'4 Operator Resources (60)\n\n?4 Operator Training (3)\n\nSystem Disruptions (1)\n\n  \n\nSystem Engineering (4)\n\n   \n\n- a a a\n2% System Limitations (67)\nTotal: 195 \n\nTO USA, FVEY) Delayed Detasking FISA Incidents: As re?ected in Figures 1a-b, during\n1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 195 FISA incidents. 19 of the total FISA incidents were\nassociated with detasking delays.

When collection occurs with one or\nboth communicants inside the US, this constitutes inadvertent collection. From 4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an\nincrease of transit program incidents submitted from 7 to 27, due to the change in our methodology for reporting and\ncounting of these types of incidents.

There was also a 260% increase in database query FISA Authority incidents during\n1QCY12. Human Error accounted for the majority of all FISA Authorities database query incidents \n\nRoamers: Roaming incidents occur when valid foreign target selector(s) are active in the US.\nRoamer incidents continue to constitute the largest category of collection incidents across E.O. 12333 and FAA\nauthorities.

NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Organization\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the total 1QCY12 NSAW SID?reported incidents by primary SID Deputy\nDirectorate (DD) level organization. S2, having the largest NSAW SID contingent of reported incidents,\naccounted for 89% of the total incidents for the quarter, a proportion consistent with the overall size of the S2\norganization. As compared to 4QCY11, S2 experienced an overall 8% reduction in incidents occurrences.\n\nFigure 8: 1QCY12 Incidents by NSAW SID Organization\n\n\n2 \n\n    \n\n:51 1\n\n772\n\niS3 56\n\nIF74 MOC 4\n\nEISSG 14\n\n1\n\ni2nd Party /Various 17\n\nTotal: 865 I DU 0\n\nFigure 9 provides a look into S2 (by Product Line) as the NSAW SID organization with the\nlargest number of reported incidents. For 1QCY12, three Product Lines accounted for 72% of 82?s reported\nincidents. These Product Lines were: the and Korea Division (S2B) with 28% of the reported incidents, the\nInternational Security Issues Division (S2C) with 23% of the reported incidents, and the China, and the Office\nof Middle East Africa (S2E) with 21% of the incidents. As compared to 4QCY11, this resulted in an increase\nof 16% for S2B, a reduction of 35% for 82C, and an increase of 9% for S2E. The number of incidents reported\nby the remaining seven Product Lines held relatively steady from 4QCY11 to 1QCY12.\n\nPage 9 of 13\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\nFigure 9: 1QCY12 S2 Incidents by Product Line\n\n\n4%\n4%  ..

(U) Significant Incidents of Non-compliance\n\nF) Business Record (BR) FISA. As of 16 February 2012, NSA determined that approximately\n3,032 files containing call detail records potentially collected pursuant to prior BR Orders were retained on a\nserver and been collected more than five years ago in violation of the 5?year retention period established for\nBR collection. Specifically, these files were retained on a server used by technical personnel working with\nthe Business Records metadata to maintain documentation of provider feed data formats and performed\n\nbackground analysis to document why certain contain chaining rules were created. In addition to the BR\nPage 11 of 13\n\nTOP \n\nTOP DFORN\n\nwork, this server also contains information related to the STELLARWIND program and ?les which do not\nappear to be related to either of these programs. NSA bases its determination that these files may be in\nviolation of docket number BR. 1 1?191 because of the type of information contained in the ?les eall\ndetail records}, tlte access to the server by technical personnel who worked with the BB. metadata, and the\nlisted ?creation date? for the tiles, It is possible that these files contain STELLARWIND data, despite the\ncreation date. The STELLARWIND data could have been copied to this server, and that process could have\nchanged the creation date to a tinteframe that appears to indicate that they may contain BR metadata.\nAdditional details regarding this incident can be found in the ?Bqu ivletadata Annes, ANNEX \n{Item in SlD?s IQCY If) Quarterly Report.\n\nT0 USA, FVEY) Detasking Delay.

Department of Justice fr??  \nr'\n\n \n\n \n\n6?  \nNational Security Division \n\nWashington, no. 20530\nNovember 20, 2007\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  \nas: ..\nTHROUGH: THE ACTING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENE  5\n.7 \nFROM: Kenneth L. Wainstein 9%    333\"\nAssistant Attorney General .7 \nNational Security Division 57;  5 \ncc: Steven G. Bradbury  \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \nOf?ce of Legal Counsel\nSUBJECT: Proposed Amendment to Department of Defense Procedures to Permit the\n\nNational Security Agency to Conduct Analysis of Communications\nMetadata Associated with Persons in the United States \n\nPURPOSE: To Recommend Attorney General Approval Pursuant to Executive Order\n12333 of a Proposed Amendment to Procedures Governing the National\nSecurity Agency?s Signals Intelligence Activities \n\nSYNOPSIS: The Secretary of Defense seeks your approval of proposed Department of\nDefense Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis\n(?Supplemental Procedures?). The Supplemental Procedures, attached at Tab A, would clarify\nthat the National Security Agency (N SA) may analyze communications metadata? associated with\nUnited States persons and persons believed to be in the United States These Supplemental\n\nProcedures would amend the existing procedures promulgated pursuant to Executive Order\n\n\n\nClassi?ed by:\nReason: .\n\nDeclassi?/ on: 20 November 2032\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nl2333.' That Order requires the NSA to conduct its signals intelligence activities involving the\ncollection, retention, or dissemination of information concerning United States persons in\naccordance with procedures approved by the Attorney General. Accordingly, changes to these\nprocedures, such as those proposed here, also require your approval. We conclude that the\nproposed Supplemental Procedures are consistent with applicable law and we recommend that\nyou approve them.2 \n\nThe communications metadata that the NSA wishes to analyzewwhich relates to both\ntelephone calls and electronic communicatiousemis dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling\ninformation that does not concern the substance, purport, or meaning of the conmrunication. The\nprocedures divide communications metadata into two categories: telephony .metadata and\nelectronic cormnunications metadata. Telephony metadata includes such information as the\ntelephone numbers of the calling and the called party. Electronic communications metadata\nincludes such information as the e?mail address and the Internet protocol (IP) address of the\ncomputer of the sender and the recipient. This communications metadata has been obtained by\nvarious methods, including pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (PISA), 50\nUSC. 1801, et seq, and resides in NSA databases.3 NSA plans to analyze this data primarily\nusing a technique known as ?contact chaining.? Contact chaining involves the identi?cation of\ntelephone numbers, email addresses, or IP addresses that a targeted telephone number, IP\naddress, or email address has contacted or attempted to contact. Through the use of computer\nalgorithms, NSA creates a chain of contacts linking communicants and identifying additional\ntelephone numbers, 1? addresses, and email addresses of intelligence interest. On the basis of\nprior informal advice of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, present practice is\nto ?stop? when a chain hits a telephone number or address believed to be used by a United States\nperson. NSA believes that it is over?identifying numbers and addresses that belong to United\nStates persons and that modifying its practice to chain throughall telephone numbers and\naddresses, including those reasonably believed to be used by a United States person, will yield\nvaluable foreign intelligence inferrnation primarily concerning non?United States persons outside\n\n \n\nProcedures Governing the Activities of DOD Intelligence Components frat \nUnited States Persons (DOD Reg. 1982)(approved by the Attorney General on\nOct. 4, Procedures?) and its Classi?ed Annex. The proposed Supplemental\nProcedures would clarify Procedure 5 of the DOD Procedures and its Classi?ed Annex. (U)\n\n2 This memorandum was prepared in consultation with the Of?ce of Legal Counsel. (U) .\n3 This memorandum assumes that the initial acquisition of the information it\nwishes to analyze was lawful. (U) \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nthe United States. It is not clear, however, whether current procedures permit chaining\nthrough a United States telephone number, address or e?mail address. (Sl/Sl)\n\nWe conclude that the proposed communications metadata analysis, including contact\nchaining, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment; (ii) and the electronic\nsurveillance provisions contained in Title 18 of the United States Code. The Supplemental\nProcedures are also consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 12333. \n\nAs you consider this proposed change, you should be aware of the following:\n\n(1) Congressional Oversight. At the request of the Secretary of Defense, NSA briefed.\nthe Select Committee on Intelligence of the United States Senate and the Permanent Select\nCommittee on Intelligence of the United States House of Representatives on this proposed\nchange before the Secretary signed the Supplemental Procedures.\n\n(2) Oversight ?3 Activities Under the Supplemental Procedures. Because NSA\nhas in its databases a large amount of communications metadata associated with persons in. the\nUnited States, misuse of this information could raise serious concerns. The General Counsel of\nNSA has provided a letter, attached at Tab B, describing how NSA will oversee access to and use\nof this data and committing to report annually to you on communications metadata\nprogram. As part of this reporting, NSA undertakes to inform the Department of ?the kinds of\ninformation that NSA is collecting and processing as communications metadata.? Particularly as\ntechnology changes, this requirement is important because the legal standards governing\nmetadata are quite different from those governing the contents of a communication. We believe\nthat the oversight and reporting regime that this letter describes is a reasonable one, and it\ninforms our recommendation that you approve the Supplemental Procedures. (S/lSl)\n\n(3) The Central Intelligence Agency ?3 (CIA) Interest in Conducting Similar 1 \nCommunications Metadara Analysis. On July 20, 2004, the General Counsel of CIA wrote to the\nGeneral Counsel of NSA and to the Counsel for Intelligence Policy asking that CIA receive from\nNSA United States communications metadata that NSA does not currently provide to CIA. The\nletter from CM is attached at Tab C. Although the proposed Supplemental Procedures do not\ndirectly address the request, they do resolve a significant legal obstacle to the \ndissemination of this metadata from NSA to CIA. \n\n(4) Department of Defense ?s (DOD) Interest in Allowing Other DOD Entities to Have\nAccess to this Data and to Conduct Similar Analysis. The General Counsel?s Of?ce has\ninformed us that, in the future, other DOD entities may wish to obtain and analyze\ncommunications nietadata using the same rules that NSA uses to do so. The proposed\nSupplemental Procedures do not apply to these other DOD entities, but you should be aware that\n\nCOM \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nsuch a request may be forthcoming. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the National\nSecurity Division will be briefed by DOD concerning what these other DOD entities are doing,\nor are seeking to do, in this area before approving any such request. \n\nDISCUSSION: (U)\nThe Fourth Amendment (U)\nThe Fourth Amendment provides that:\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants\nshall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\nseized.\n\n.S. Const. amend. IV. This provision protects against the unreasonable search and seizure of\nthe contents of a communication in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. See\nKai?s v. 389 us. 347 0967). We conclude that a person has no such expectation, however,\nin dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information that does not concern the substance,\npurport, or meaning of communications.4 We reach this conclusion with respect to ?metadata?\n\n \n\n4 As an initial matter, we note that the analysis of information legally within the\npossession of the Government is likely neither a ?search? nor a ?seizure? Within the meaning of\nthe Fourth Amendment. See, cg, fobara 12. Webster, 691 F.2d 272, 277?79 (6th Cir 1982)\n(holding that the disclosure of information by an agency that lawfully possessed it to another\nagency does not implicate the Fourth Amendment); Memorandum for the Attorney General from\nTheodore B. Olson, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Constitutionality of\nCertain National Security Agency Electronic Surveillance Activities Not Covered Under the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of1978, at 59 (May 24 1984) (?Olson Memorandum?)\n(?Traditional Fourth Amendment analysis holds that once evidence is constitutionally seized, its\ndissemination or subsequent use raises no additional Fourth Amendment question?). As noted,\nwe assume for the purpose of this memorandum that the NSA has lawfully acquired the\ninformation it wishes to analyze. Nevertheless, the Olson Memorandum went on to consider the\nlimits on the subsequent use of information when assessing the constitutionality ofNSA?s\n. surveillance activities under the Fourth Amendment. See id. In an abundance of caution, then,\nwe analyze the constitutional issue on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment may apply\neven though the Government has already obtained the information lawfully. \n\n\n\nc4?\n\n \n\ni . \n\nassociated With both telephone calls and electronic communications.5 (Sl/Sl)\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in\ntelephone numbers dialed because a caller must convey the numbers to the telephone company to\ncomplete the call. See Sizzitlt v. Maryland, 442 US. 735, 743?44 (1.979). In Smith, the Court\nconcluded that the installation of a pen register was not a ?search? within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment, and thus that no warrant was required to collect such information. 10'. at\n745-46. This conclusion followed from the Court?s previous holding in US. v. Miller, 425 US.\n435 (1976), that an individual has no Fourth Amendment privacy interest in information released\nto a third party and later conveyed by that third party to a. governmental entity. Id. at 440.\nAccordingly, it is well settled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephony\nmetadata the NSA proposes to analyze.6 \n\nLikewise, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic communications\nmetadata. For Fourth Amendment proposes, courts have considered e?mails to be analogous to\ntelephone calls and to letters sent through the postal system. See US. v. Charbonneau, 979 F.\nSupp 1177, 1184 Ohio 1997); US. v. Maxwell, 45 MJ. 406,417 (C.A.A.F. 1996).\nFollowing the same approach as Smith, courts have consistently held that the Fourth Amendment\nis not implicated when the Government gathers information that appears on mail covers,\nincluding the name and address of the addressee and of the sender, the postmark, and the class of\nmail. See US. v. Charlie, 576 F.2d 165, 174 (9th Cir. 1978); US. v. DePoli, 628 F.2d 779 (2nd\nCir. 1980); US. v. Huie, 593 F.2d 14 (5th Cir. 1979)(per curiarn). See also Vreelren v. Davis,\n718 F.2d 343, 34748 (10th Cir. 1983) (concluding that a mail cover, whichrec?ords information\nabout the sender and recipient ofa letter, is ?indistinguishable in any important respect from the\npen register at issue in Smith?)- And courts have consistently found that individuals do not have\na reasonable expectation of privacy in information pertaining to the use of electronic media that\n\n \n\n5 It is important to note that this memorandum addresses only those types of metadata\nspeci?cally identi?ed in the Supplemental Procedures. As described above, NSA is required to\nreport regularly to the Department on new types of information that it is treating as ?metadata.?\ndoes so, we will evaluate whether such new information 51130 falls outside the Fourth\nAmendment. \n\n6 Smith continues to be cited by the Supreme Court and lower courts for the proposition\nthat acquisition of telephone numbers does not implicate the Fourth Amendment. See, Kylie\nv. United States, 5331.38. 27, 33 (2001); US. elecom Commission v. FCC, 227 F.3d 450, 454\n(DC. Cir. 2000). (U)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n{1065 not tilt: substantive content eta communication.7 The electronic communications\n.metadata the NSA proposes to analyzewdialing, routing, addressing or signalng information?43\nidentical. in all material respects to the information deemed not to implicate the Fourth\nAmendment in these lines ofcases. \n\nThus, when interpreting the Fourth Amendment, the courts have drawn a consistent\ndistinction between the substantive content of the communications (found to be protected in\nKatz) and the non~content information (found to be unprotected in Smith, Miller and a number of\nlower court cases). The communications metadata implicated by the proposed Supplemental\nProcedures is limited to dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information and is de?ned\nspeci?cally to exclude any information that concerns the substance, purport or meaning of the\ncommunication. Thus it falls clearly within the second, unprotected category of information,\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in this metadata and\nthat the communications metadata analysis proposed by NSA does not implicate the Fourth\nAmendment. \n\nElectronic Surveillance Provisions (U)\nTo fall Within coverage of ?electronic surveillance,? an action must satisfy one of\n\nthe four de?nitions of that term. None of these de?nitions cover the communications metadata\nanalysis at issue here.8 (S)\n\n \n\n7 See Thygeson v. US. Bancorp, WL 2066746 (D. Or. 2004) (noting the distinction\nbetween the website addresses at issue there, in Which an employee had no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, and the contents of websites visited or emails sent). See also US. v.\n225 F.3d 656 (4th Cir. 2000) (unpublished opinion) (holding that, although in certain\ncircumstances a person may have a privacy interest in ?content information\"; such as the\nsubstance of an e-maii, there is no privacy interest in inferrnation provided to the ISP for\npurposes of establishing the account, which, according to the court, is non?centent information);\nUS. v. Oizrzesorge, 60 MJ. 946 (N.M. Ct. Crim. App. 2005) (holding that there is no reasonable \nexpectation. of privacy regarding information provided to an ISP). \n\n8 As noted above, some of the metadata the NSA would analyze has been acquired\npursuant to FISA and thus is subject to the minimization procedures applicable to that collection.\nThe standard NSA PISA minimization procedures contain no restrictions that would prohibit the\nmeta/data analysis described herein. The NSA will continue to comply with these procedures,\nincluding with any restrictions on the dissemination of information. In addition, to the extent\nthat any orders authorizing, under PISA, the collection of metadata impose minimization\nprocedures that would restrict the metadata analysis in the manner proposed here by NSA, the\nNSA must continue to abide by the conditions in those orders. \n\n\n\n.. \n\n \n\n\n\nThree of the four de?nitions of electronic surveillance are satisfied only when the\ncommunication is acquired ?under circumstances in which. a person has a reasonable expectation\nof privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.? 50 U.S.C.\n1801(f)(l), (3), (4). This statutory expectationmof-privacy requirement adopts a term of art\nfrom Fourth Amendment case law. See, eg, Kata, 389 US. at 361 (Harlan, 1., concurring).\n?[W]here Congress borrows terms of art . . . it presumably knows and adepts . . . the meaning\n[their] use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.? Morissette v. United\nStates, 342 US. 246, 263 (1952). The legislatiVe history con?rms the applicability of this\npresumption in this instance. it repeatedly adverts to constitutional standards when discussing\nthis provision. See, tag, S. Rep. 95301, at 37, _1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4006 (noting that the\nprovision ?require[s] that the acquisition of information be under circumstances in which a\nperson has a constitutionally protected right of privacy?); HR. Rep. No- 95?1283, at 53 (same);\nS. Rep. No. 95-604, at 35, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3937 (same). For the reasons stated above,\nthere is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the communications metadata at issue here;\ntherefore, proposed activity would not come Within the de?nitions of electronic\nsurveillance contained in subsections 1801(t)(1), (3) or (4). (S)\n\nThe fourth de?nition of electronic surveillance involves ?the acquisition by an electronic,\nmechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any Wire communication . . .  50\nU.S.C. 1802(f)(2). ?Wire communication? is, in turn, de?ned as ?any conununieatiou while it\nis being carried by a wire, cable, or other like connection ?irnished or operated by any person\nengaged as a common carrier . . . Id. 1801(1). The data that the NSA wishes to analyze\nalready resides in its databases. The proposed analysis thus does not involve the acquisition of a\ncommunication ?while it is being carried? by a connection ?imished or operated by a common,\ncarrier. \n\nPen Register and Trap and Trace Provisions (U)\n\nThe pen register and trap and trace surveillance provisions of PISA, 50 U.S.C. 1841-\n1846, and of the criminal law, 18 U.S.C. 3121?27, do not apply to the communications\nmetadata analysis that NSA wishes to conduct. \n\nFirst, for the purpose of these provisions, ?pen register? is de?ned as ?a device or process\nwhich records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing or signaling infonnation.? 18 U.S.C.\n3127(3); 50 U.S.C. 1841(2). When NSA will conduct the analysis it proposes, however, the\ndialing and other information will have been already recorded and decoded. Second, a ?trap and\ntrace device? is de?ned as ?a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other\nimpulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing and\nsignaling information.? 18 U.S.C. 3127(4); 50 U.S.C. Again, those impulses'will\nalready have been captured at the point that NSA conducts chaining. Thus, \ncommunications metadata analysis falls outside the coverage of these provisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nTitle 111 (U)\n\nThe federal criminal wiretap statute, Title of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe\nStreets Act, 18 U.S.C. 2510, et seq., prohibits the unauthorized ?intercept[ion]? of any wire,\noral or electronic communication, id. at 251 which is de?ned as the acquisition of the\n?contents? of the communication, id. at 2510(4). It also prohibits the use and disclosure of the\n?contents? of such a communication if it was unlaw?illy intercepted. See id. at 2511(1). For\nthe purpose of these prohibitions, ?contents? is de?ned as ?information concerning the substance,\npurport, or meaning of that communication.? Id. 2510(8); see {?uted States v. New York\nTelephone Co, 434 US. l59 (1977) (holding that Title Ill does not cover the acquisition of\nmetadata with pen registers). By its terms, the Supplemental Procedures? de?nition of the\nrnetadata to be analyzed excludes information about the substance, purport, or\nmeaning of the communication. For this reason at least, the prohibitions of section 2511(1) do\nnot apply to the proposed communications metadata analysis. \n\nExecutive Order 12333 and Related Procedures (U)\n\nExecutive Order 12333 requires the NSA to conduct its signals intelligence activities\ninvolving the collection, retention, or dissemination of information concerning United States\npersons in accordance with procedures approved by the Attorney General. See id. 2.3; 2.4.9\nThese meedures rnust permit the collection, retention, and dissemination of certain types of\ninformation including foreign intelligence information in a manner that protects constitutional\nand other legal rights and limits the use of the information to lawful government purposes. See\nid. 2.4. The Attorney General approved the current Department of Defense procedures and\nClassi?ed Annex in October 1982. (U) \n\nI The current DOD procedures and their Classi?ed Annex may be read to restrict \n\nability to conduct the desired corrununications metadata analysis, at least with respect to metadata\nassociated with United States persons. In particular, this analysis may fall within the procedures?\ndefinitions of, and thus restrictions on, the ?interception? and ?selection? of communications.\n\n \n\n9 In addition, section 2.5 of Executive Order 123 33 provides that the ?Attorney General\nhereby is delegated the power to the use for intelligence purposes, within the United\nStates or against a United States person abroad, of any technique for which a warrant would be\nrequired if undertaken for law enforcement purposes.? Because individuals have no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the types of nietadata at issue here, no warrant would be required to\nanalyze this information for law enforcement purposes. In addition, the analysis of information\nlegally within the possession of the government is likely neither a ?search? nor a ?seizure? within\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment. See note 4, supra. Section. 2.5 thus does not require the\nAttorney General to approve preposed analysis otjconununications inetadata. (S)\n\nOMIN Tf/ ORC ON 0F \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAccordingly, the Supplemental Procedures that would govern analysis of communications\nmetadata expressly state that the DOD Procedures and the Classi?ed Annex do not apply to the\nanalysis of conununications metadata. Speci?cally, the Supplemental Procedures would clarify\nthat ?contact chaining and other metadata analysis do not qualify as the ?interception? or\n?selection? of communications, nor do they qualify as ?us[ing] a selection tenn,? including using a\nselection term ?intended to intercept a communication on the basis of . [some] aspect of the\ncontent of the communication.? Once approved, the Supplemental Procedures will clarify that\nthe communications metadata analysis the NSA wishes to conduct is not restricted by the DOD \nprocedures and their Classi?ed Annex. \n\nThe Supplemental Procedures de?ne the terms ?communications metadata,? ?contact\nchaining,? and ?metadata analysis.? The Supplemental Procedures also state that NSA will\nconduct contact chaining and other rnetadata analysis only for valid?foreign intelligence\npurposes; disseminate the results of its analysis in accordance with current procedures governing\ndissemination of information concerning U.S. persons as set forth in Section 4.A.4 of the\nClassi?ed Annex; and investigate any apparent misuse or improper dissemination of metadata\nand report the same to the appropriate oversight organization(s). \n\nIn addition, the NSA letter accompanying the Supplemental Procedures proposes a\nregulatory and. oversight regime for the handling of communications metadata of US. persons.\nNSA states that access to cormnunications metadata will be restricted to only those personnel\nwith a. need for this data in the performance of their of?cial duties. Before gaining access to\ncommunications metadata, NSA or other personnel working under the authority of the Director\n7 will receive mandatory training approved by the General Counsel of NSA on the proper\nuse of suchdatabases and chaining tools. When logging into the electronic data system, users\nwill View a banner that rewemphasizes key points regarding use of the data, chaining tools, and\nproper dissemination of results. NSA will also create an audit trail of every query made in each\ndatabase containing U.S. cormnunications metadata, and a network of auditors will Spot?check\nactivities in the database to ensure compliance with all procedures. .In addition, the NSA\nOversight and Compliance Office will conduct periodic super audits to verify that activities\nremain properly controlled. Finally, NSA will report any misuse of the information to the \nInspector General and Of?ce of General Counsel for inclusion in existing or future reporting\nmechanisms related to Signals intelligence activities. \n\nNSA also states it will report any changes to this oversight regime to the Assistant\nAttorney General for the National Security Division, and, by October 15 of each year, will submit\na report to the Attorney General regarding the kinds of information the NSA is collecting and\nprocessing as communications metadata, implementation of its compliance procedures,\nand any signi?cant new legal or oversight issues that have arisen in connection with \nactivities described in this memorandum. (C)\n\n\n\n-9-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAS drafted, the Supplemental Procedures meet the requirements of Executive Order\n12333. Together with the current approved procedures, they continue to permit the collection'of\nforeign intelligence and other inferination and, as explained above, the metadata analysis will be\nfor lawful goveminent puiposes and consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law.\n\n(5)\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Based on the information provided by NSA and our analysis of,\napplicable law, we conclude that there are no constitutional or statutory restrictions on \nproposed use of coxmnunications metadata. We therefore recommend that you approve the\nSupplemental Procedures. -\n\n\n\n\"10-\n\n \n\nv: 5 'v 'eDepartment of Defense Supplemental Procedures Governing\nCommunications Metadata Analysis\n\nSec. 1: Purpose\n\nThese procedures supplement the Procedures found in DOD Regulation\n5240. and the Classi?ed Annex thereto. These procedures govern \nanalysis of data that it has already lawfully collected and do not authorize\ncollection of additional data. These procedures also clarify that, except as stated\nin section 3 below, the Procedures in DOD Regulation 5240.141 and the Classi?ed\nAnnex thereto do not apply to the analysis of corrununications metadata.\n\nSec. 2: De?nitions\n\nCorrununications metadata means the dialing, routing, addressing, or\nsignaling information associated with a conununication, but does not\ninclude information concerning the substance, purport or meaning of the\ncommunication. The two principal subsets of communications metadata are\ntelephony metadata and electronic communications metadata.\n\n. Telephony \"metadata\" includes the telephone number of the calling\nparty, the telephone number of the called party, and the date, time, and\nduration of the call. It does not include the substance, purport, or\nmeaning of the communication.\n\nFor electronic communications, \"metadata\"includes the information\nappearing on the \"from,\" and \"bcc\" lines of a standard\ne?mail or other electronic communication. or e?mail cominunications,\nthe \"from\" line contains the e?tnail address of the sender, and the \nand \"bcc\" lines contain the e?mail addresses of the recipients.\n\"Metadata\" also means 1) information about the lntemet-protocol \naddress of the computer from which an email or other electronic\nconununication was sent and, depending on the circumstances, the IP\naddress of routers and servers on the internet that have handled the\ncommunication during transmission; (2) the exchange of an address and\ne?mail address that occurs when a user logs into a web?based email\nservice; and (3) for certain logins to web-based e?mail accounts, inbox\nmetadata that is transmitted to the user upon secessing the account.\n\"Metadata\" associated with electronic conun?unications does not include\ninformation from the \"subject\" or \"re\" line of an email or information\nfrom the body of an e?mailJain. l. *3 Exit.? it} 3. to}.

(U) INTRODUCTION\n\n \n\n(U) This Report\n\nOn 4 October 2001, President George W. Bush issued a\nmemorandum entitled FOR SPECIFIED\nELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES DURING A LIMITED\nPERIOD TO DETECT AND PREVENT ACTS OF TERRORISM\nWITHIN THE UNITED The memorandum was based on the\nPresident?s determination that after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks\nin the United States, an extraordinary emergency existed for national\ndefense purposes.\n\nThe 4 October 2001 Presidential authorization delegated\nauthority to the Secretary of Defense, who further delegated it to the\nDirector of National Securitv Agencv/Chief. Central Securitv Service\nto conduct speci?ed electronic surveillance on targets\nrelated to Afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days. Because the\nsurveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of\nthe United States, it would otherwise have required FISC authority.\n\nThe Authorization speci?ed that NSA could acquire the\ncontent and associated metadata of telephony and Internet communications\nfor which there was probable cause to believe that one of the\ncommunicants was in Afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged\nin or preparing for acts of international terrorism. In addition, NSA was\nauthorized to acquire telephony and Internet metadata? for communications\nwith at least one communicant outside the United States or for which no\ncommunicant was known to be a citizen of the United States. NSA was\nalso allowed to retain, process, analyze and disseminate intelligence from\nthe communications acquired under the authority. 2\n\n \n\nThis report provides the classi?ed results of the NSA Office of\nthe Inspector General (OIG) review of the President?s Surveillance\nProgram (PSP) as mandated in the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) of 2008.\nIt includes the facts necessary to describe from perspective:\n\n \n\n(U)Metadata is data that describes content, events, or networks associated with SIGINT targets.\n2 (U)The Authority changed over time.

As mandated by the FAA, this review includes activities\nauthorized by the President between 11 September 2001 and 17 January\n2007 and those activities continued under FISC authority. This includes\nthe program described by the President in a\n\n17 December 2005 radio address as the Terrorist Surveillance Program,\nwhich was content collected under the Authorization.\n\nTOP SECRE OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nII. REVIEW CATEGORIES\n\n(U) ONE: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUTHORITY\n\nImmediately after the attacks of 1] September 2001, NSA considered\nhow to work within existing SIGINT authorities to counter the terrorist threat\nwithin the United States and adjusted SIGIN processes accordingly. Shortly\nthereafter; in reSponse to a White House request, the Director of NSA identified\nSIGIN collection gaps. The Counsel to the Vice President used this information\nto dra? the Presidential authorization that established the PSP.\n\n(U) Actions Taken After 9/1 1\n\n \n\nOn 14 September 2001, three days after terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States, General Hayden approved the targeting of terrorist-\nassociated foreign telephone numbers on communication links between the\nUnited States and foreign countries where terrorists were known to be\noperating. Only speci?ed, pre-approved numbers were allowed to be\ntasked for collection against U.S.-originating links. He authorized this\ncollection at Special Collection Service and Foreign Satellite sites with\naccess to links between the United States and countries of interest,\nincluding Afghanistan. According to the Deputy General Counsel, General\nHayden determined by 26 September that any Afghan telephone number in\ncontact with a US. telephone number on or after 26 September was\npresumed to be of foreign intelligence value and could be disseminated to\nthe FBI.\n\nNSA OGC said General Hayden?s action was a lawful\nexercise of his power under Executive Order (E.O.) 12333, United States\nIntelligence Activities, as amended. The targeting of communication links\nwith one end in the United States was a more aggressive use of ED. 12333\nauthority than that exercised by former Directors. General Hayden was\noperating in a unique environment in which it was a widely held belief that\nadditional terrorist attacks on US. soil were imminent. General Hayden\nsaid this was a ?tactical decision.?\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SECRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nOn 2 October 2001, General Hayden briefed the House\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) on this decision and\nlater informed members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(SSCI) by telephone. He had also informed DCI George Tenet.\n\n(TS) At the same time NSA was assessing collection gaps and increasing\nefforts against terrorist targets immediately after the 11 September attacks, .\nit was responding to Department of Defense (DOD), Director of Central\nIntelligence Community Management Staff questions about its ability to\ncounter the new threat.\n\n(U) Need to Expand NSA Authority\n\nGeneral Hayden said that soon after he told Mr. Tenet about\nNSA actions to counter the threat, Mr. Tenet shared the information with\nthe ?Oval Office.? Mr. Tenet relayed that the Vice President wanted to\nknow if NSA could be doing more. General Hayden replied that nothing\nelse could be done within existing NSA authorities. In a follow-up\ntelephone conversation, Mr. Tenet asked General Hayden what could be\ndone if he had additional authorities. General Hayden said that these\ndiscussions were not documented.\n\nNSA Identifies SIGIN Collection Gaps\n\nTo respond to the Vice President, General Hayden met with\nNSA personnel who were already working to identify and ?ll SIGINT\ncollection gaps in light of the recent terrorist attacks. General Hayden\nstated that he met with personnel to identify which additional authorities\nwould be operationally useful and technically feasible. In particular,\ndiscussions focused on how NSA might bridge the ?international gap.? An\nNSA Technical Director described that gap in these terms:\n\n?Here is NSA standing at the US. border looking outward for\nforeign threats. There is the FBI looking within the United\nStates for domestic threats. But no one was looking at the\nforeign threats coming into the United States. That was a\nhuge gap that NSA wanted to cover. \n\nPossible Solutions. Among other things, NSA considered\nhow to tweak transit collection?the collection of communications\ntransiting through but not originating or terminating in the United States.\nNSA personnel also resurfaced a concept proposed in 1999 to address the\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nMillennium Threat. NSA proposed that it would perform contact chaining\non metadata it had collected. would chain through masked U.S.\ntelephone numbers to discover foreign connections to those numbers,\nwithout specifying, even for the US. number involved. In\nDecember 1999, the Department of Justice Office of Intelligence\nPolicy Review (OIPR) told NSA that the proposal fell within one of the\nFISA de?nitions of electronic surveillance and, therefore, was not\npermissible when applied to metadata associated with presumed U.S.\npersons U.S. telephone numbers not approved for targeting by the\nFISC).\n\nCollection gaps not adequately filled by FISA\nauthorized intercept. NSA determined that FISA authorization did not\nallow sufficient ?exibility to counter the new terrorist threat. First, it\nbelieved that because of technological advances, the jurisdiction of the\nFISC went beyond the original intent of the statute. For example, most\ncommunications signals no longer ?owed through radio signals-signals or\nvia phone svstems as they did in 1978 when the ISA was written. By\n2001, Internet communications were used worldwide, undersea cables\ncarried huge volumes of communications, and a large amount of the\nworld?s communications passed through the United States. Because of\nlanguage used in the Act in 1978, NSA was required to obtain court orders\nto target email accounts used by non-US. persons outside the United States\nif it intended to intercept the communications at a webmail service within\nthe United States. Large numbers of terrorists were using such accounts in\n2001.\n\nSecond, NSA believed that the FISA process was unable to\naccommodate the number of terrorist targets or the speed with which they\nchanged their communications. From the time NSA sent FISA requests to\nthe Do], OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average wait was\nbetween four and six weeks. Terrorists could have changed their telephone\nnumbers or internet addresses before NSA received FISC approval to target\nthem. NSA believed the large number of terrorist targets and their\nfrequently changing communications would have overwhelmed the\nexisting FISA process.\n\n \n\nEmergency FISA provision not an option. NSA\ndetermined that even using emergency FISA court orders would not\nprovide the speed and ?exibility needed to counter the terrorist threat.\nFirst, although the emergency authorization provision permitted 72 hours\nof surveillance without obtaining a court order, it did not?as many\nbelieved?allow the Government to undertake surveillance immediately.\nRather, the Attorney General had to ensure that emergency surveillance\nwould ultimately be acceptable to the FISC. He had to be certain the court\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nwould grant a warrant before initiating emergency surveillance.\nAdditionally, before NSA surveillance requests were submitted to the\nAttorney General, they had to be reviewed by NSA intelligence officers,\nNSA attorneys, and Department of Justice attorneys. Each reviewer had to\nbe satis?ed that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the\nnext review group, and each request was certi?ed by a senior o?icial in the\nusually the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. From the time NSA sent a\nrequest to Justice?s OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average\nwait was between half. In the existing threat\nenvironment with US. interests at risk, NSA deemed the wait too long.\n\n \n\nEarly Efforts to Amend FISA\n\nGiven the limitations of FISA, there were early\nefforts to amend the statute. For example, shortly after 11\nSeptember, the HPSCI asked NSA for technical assistance\nin drafting a proposal to amend Section of FISA that\nwould give the President the authority to conduct electronic\nsurveillances without a court order for the purpose of\nobtaining foreign intelligence information. On\n\n20 September 2001, the NSA General Counsel wrote to\nJudge Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the President, asking\nwhether the proposal had merit. We found no record of a\nresponse.\n\nWe could not determine why early efforts to\namend FISA were abandoned. Anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that government officials feared the public debate\nsurrounding any changes to FISA would compromise\nintelligence sources and methods.\n\n \n\n \n\n(U) NSA identifies SIGINT collection gaps to Vice President?s Office.\n\nBecause early discussions about expanding authority\nwere not documented, we do not have records of speci?c topics discussed\nor people who attended General Hayden?s meetings with White House\nrepresentatives. General Hayden stated that after consulting with NSA\npersonnel, he described to the White House how NSA collection of\ncommunications on a wire inside the United States was constrained by the\nFISA statute. Speci?cally, NSA could not collect from a wire in the United\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nStates, without a court order, either content or metadata from\ncommunications links with either one or both ends in the United States.\nFurthermore, General Hayden pointed out that communications metadata\ndid not have the same level of constitutional protection as content and that\naccess to metadata of communications with one end in the United States\nwould signi?cantly enhance analytic capabilities. General Hayden\nsuggested that the ability to collect communications with one end in the\nUnited States without a court order would increase speed and\nagility. General Hayden stated that after two additional meetings with the\nVice President, the Vice President asked him to work with his Counsel,\nDavid Addington.\n\n(U) Presidential Authorization Drafted and Signed\n\n \n\nAccording to General Hayden, the Vice President?s\nCounsel, David Addington, drafted the ?rst Authorization. General\nHayden described himself as the ?subject matter expert? but stated that no\nother NSA personnel participated in the drafting process, including the\nGeneral Counsel. He also said that Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrepresentatives were not involved in any of the discussions that he attended\nand he did not otherwise inform them.\n\nGeneral Hayden said he was ?surprised with a small \nwhen the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, and that it only\nchanged the location from which NSA could collect communications.\n\nRules for minimizing US. person information still had to be followed.\n\nSIGINT Activity Authorized by the President\n\n \n\nOn 4 October 2001, the President delegated authority\nthrough the Secretary of Defense to the Director of NSA to conduct\nspeci?ed electronic surveillance on targets related to Afghanistan and\ninternational terrorism for 30 days. Because the surveillance included wire\nand cable communications carried into or out of the United States, it would\notherwise have required FISC authority.\n\nThe Authorization allowed NSA to conduct four types\nof collection activity:\n\nTelephony content\n\nInternet content\n\nTOP SE CRE TL OMIN OF ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONW 0F ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTelephony metadata\nInternet metadata\n\nNSA could collect the content and associated metadata of\ntelephony and Internet communications for which there was probable cause\nto believe that one of the communicants was in Afghanistan or that one,\ncommunicant was engaged in or preparing for acts of international\nterrorism. In addition, NSA was authorized to acquire telephony and\nInternet metadata for communications with at least one communicant\noutside the United States or for which no communicant was known to be a\ncitizen of the United States. NSA was also allowed to retain, process,\nanalyze and disseminate intelligence from the communications acquired\nunder the authority.\n\nSubsequent Changes to the Authorization\n\nAfter the ?rst Presidential authorization, the speci?c terms,\nwording, or interpretation of the renewals periodically changed. (See\nAppendix for a completed listing of changes.)\n\nDomestic Collection. The wording of the ?rst\nauthorization could have been interpreted to allow domestic content\ncollection where both communicants were located in the US. or were U.S.\npersons. General Hayden recalled that when the Counsel to the Vice\nPresident pointed this out, General Hayden told him that NSA would not\ncollect domestic communications because 1) NSA was a foreign intelligence\nagency, 2) NSA infrastructure did not support domestic collection, and 3) his\npersonal standard was so high that there would be no problem getting a\nFISC order for domestic collection.\n\nAfghanistan. In January 2002, after the Taliban was forced\nout of power, Afghanistan was no longer speci?cally identi?ed in the\nAuthorization.\n\nIraqi Intelligence Service. For a limited period of time\nsurrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the President authorized the use of\nPSP authority against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. On 28 March 2003,\nthe DCI determined that, based on then current intelligence, the Iraqi\nIntelligence service was engaged in terrorist activities and presented a\nthreat to US. interests in the United States and abroad. Through the\nDeputy DCI, Mr. Tenet received the President?s concurrence that PSP\nauthorities could be used against the Iraqi Intelligence Service.

He and NSA leadership strove\nto ensure that NSA personnel executed the terms of the Authorization with\ncare and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized.\nPSP?related operations began on 6 October. Early on, personnel worked\nunder the assumption that the Authorization was temporary and that\noperations would stop in the near future. After it became evident that the\nAuthority would be continuously renewed, management focused on\ndesigning processes and procedures for Program activity.\n\nStand Up of Operations\n\n \n\nOn 4 October 2001, after receiving the Authorization, General\nHayden informed the SIGINT Director and other key personnel of \nnew authorities and asked the NSA General Counsel if the Authorization\nwas legal. The General Counsel said that the next day, 5 October, he told\nGeneral Hayden that he believed it was legal (see Appendix D).\n\nUnder General Hayden?s direction, immediate steps were\ntaken to implement the temporary authority.\n\nA 24-hour watch operation, the Metadata Analysis Center (MAC),\nwas created in the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID).\n\nThe first Program Manager was identi?ed and informed of his new\nresponsibilities.\n\nA cadre of experienced operational personnel was chosen to\nimplement the Program.\n\nOf?ce space was identi?ed to accommodate newly assigned\npersonnel.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nTOP SE CRE 0F ORN\n\n7109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nA new security compartment with the temporary cover term\nSTARBURST was established.3\n\nFifty computer servers to store and process data acquired under the\nnew authority were ordered.4\n\nInitial funding of $25 million for PSP operations was obtained from\nthe DCI.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, 6 and 7 October, small groups of\noperational personnel were called at home and asked to report to work for\nspecial PSP clearance brie?ngs.\n\nOn Monday, 8 October 2001, Columbus Day, General\nHayden briefed the programmers, and mathematicians that had\nbeen selected to implement the Authorization. At that brie?ng, General\nHayden said he did not share the speci?c content of the Authorization with\nattendees but relayed key information such as:\n\nThe Authorization came from the President.\nThe Authorization was temporary.\n\nThe Authorization was intended to be an early warning system of\nimpending terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nThe NSA General Counsel had reviewed the Authorization and\nconcluded that it was legal.\n\nNSA would do exactly what the Authorization stated and ?not one\nelectron or photon more.?\n\nThe Authorization should be kept secret and it required strict\ncompartmentation.

On 11 October 2001, the Associate General\nCounsel for Operations and the NSA Deputy General Counsel were cleared\nfor the Program and agreed with the NSA General Counsel?s determination\nthat the Authorization was legal. NSA OGC did not formally document its\nopinions or legal rationale (see Appendix D).\n\nF) The MAC was created to analyze metadata obtained\nunder PSP authorization. By 7 October 2001, it was a 24-hour 7-day a\nweek watch center with 20 reporters, and software developers\nworking in three shifts. Many MAC employees were former Russian traf?c\nwith manual call chaining analysis experience. Initially, the MAC\nreported directly to General Hayden and the Deputy Director. The MAC\nChief briefed the Director every week, and the Deputy Director visited\nMAC spaces for a brie?ng each evening.\n\nWhile the MAC was setting up to analyze PSP metadata, the\nCounterterrorism (CT) Product Line was realigning to conduct PSP content\ntasking and analysis. The MAC and the CT Product Line worked closely\ntogether to coordinate efforts and share information. The CT Product Line\nwas growing rapidly as handpicked employees were moved to support the\nnew mission.\n\nWithin 30 days, the PSP was fully operational. While\nawaiting delivery of requested computer servers, the FBI and CIA gave\nNSA lead telephone numbers, and the MAC was able to immediately chain\nwithin the United States with SIGINT collected overseas. Private sector\npartners began to send telephony and Internet content to NSA in October\n2001. They began to send telephony and Internet metadata to NSA as early\nas November 2001.\n\n(UIIFOUO) On-Going Operations\n\n \n\nAfter operations began and it became evident that the\nAuthorization was likely to be renewed inde?nitely, NSA management\nbecame increasingly focused on designing processes and procedures to\nimplement the Program effectively and to ensure compliance with the\nAuthorization.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\n11\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) Organizational Structure\n\nNSA conducted all PSP analysis and reporting at its\nheadquarters at Ft. Meade, Maryland, within the SIGINT Directorate.\nSpeci?cally, tasking approvals, analysis, and reportng were conducted in\nthe CT Product Line within SID, Analysis and Production. Collection of\ndata was managed in SID, Directorate for Acquisition. No PSP activities\nwere managed at NSA ?eld sites.\n\n \n\nF) Although the formal chain of command for SIGINT\noperations was through SID, in practice, the Director and Deputy Director\nof managed the Program while keeping the SIGINT Director\ninformed. Over time, the SIGINT Director became more involved, but the\nDirector and Deputy Director always maintained direct operational control.\n\nProgram Manager. Five officials held the Program\nManager position over the life of the PSP.5 Initially, the Program Manager\nreported to the Chief of the CT Product Line. In 2004, the Program\nManager position was restructured as the SID Program Manager for CT\nSpecial Projects and elevated to report to the SIGINT Director. This\nallowed the Program Manager jurisdiction of PSP elements across SID, not\njust those within the Directorate for Analysis and Production. At that time,\nthe position was also formally designated as a senior level civilian position.\nA small staff was added to form the Program Management Office.\n\nSID Analysis and Production. Initially, the MAC\nanalyzed PSP metadata (data that describes the content, events, or networks\nassociated with SIGINT targets), while SIGINT Development in the CT\nProduct Line analyzed non-PSP metadata. The CT Product Line performed\nPSP content analysis. SIGINT Development, a separate organization\nwithin the SID, managed approvals for content tasking. In 2004, the\nanalysis and production of metadata and content were consolidated into a\nnew organization called the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD). AAD\nwas divided into three teams: intemet metadata, telephony metadata, and\ncontent.\n\nCoordination with FBI and CIA. By 2004, four FBI\nintegrees and two CIA integrees, operating under SIGINT authorities in\naccordance with written agreements, were co-located with NSA PSP-\n\n \n\nThe Chief of the CT Product Line was Acting Program Manager for a brief time in 2004.\nTOP SECRE 0F ORN\n\nI2\n\n(U) Metadata\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\ncleared The purpose of co?locating these individuals was to\nimprove collaborative analytic efforts.\n\nSID Data Acquisition. Through the life of the Program,\ndata collection was managed by Special Source Operations in SID, Data\nAcquisition Directorate. Collection managers were responsible for putting\ntelephone numbers and email selectors on PSP-authorized collection by\nprivate sector companies and taking them off collection.\n\nThe authority to collect bulk telephony and Internet metadata\nsigni?cantly enhanced ability to identify activity that may have been\nterrorist-related. Contact chaining is the process of building a network\ngraph that models the communication (e-mail, telephony, etc.) patterns of\ntargeted entities (people, organizations, etc) and their associates from the\ncommunications sent or received by the targets.6 Metadata is data that\ndescribes other data, speci?cally information that describes the content,\nevents or networks associated with SIGINT targets. For example, for an\nemail message, it would include the sender and recipient email addresses.\nIt does not contain the subject line or the text of the email; they are\nconsidered to be content. Likewise. for a telephone conversation. metadata\nwould include the called number and the calling number as well as the\nduration of the call.\n\n \n\nAlthough NSA had the capability to collect bulk telephony\nand Internet metadata prior to the PSP, its application was limited because\nNSA did not have the authority to collect communications in which one\nend (the number being called or the recipient address of an e-mail) was in\nthe United States. PSP signi?cantly increased the data available to NSA\nand allowed them to create more thorough contact chaining. This\ngave NSA the key to an early warning system?the ability to identify\nindividuals in the United States or individuals outside the US. using US.\ntelecommunications structures in contact with a foreign target, a terrorist.\n\nBecause metadata was not constitutionally protected, NSA\ndid not consider it to be as sensitive as content collection. Nevertheless,\nprocesses were set up to document requests for metadata analysis and\njusti?cations for conducting such analysis under Program authority. The\n\n \n\n6 Additional chaining can be performed on the associates? contacts to determine patterns in\nthe way a network of targets may communicate. Additional degrees of separation from the initial target are\nreferred to as ?hops.? For example a direct contact is one hep away from the target. A contact of the direct\ncontact would be described as being 2 hops away from the target. The resulting contact-graph is subsequently\nanalyzed for intelligence and to develop potential investigative leads.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n13\n\n51109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SECRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nfollowing describes the process used to obtain requests, conduct analysis,\nand report results under the PSP. (See Appendix for a ?owchart of the\nend-to-end process.)\n\nRequests for Information and Leads. Contact chaining\nanalysis requests were received from FBI, CIA, or NSA. Requests\ntypically took one of two forms, Requests for Information (RF I) and Leads.\nRFIs were speci?c questions about a target?s telephone numbers or email\naddresses, called ?selectors? at NSA. Leads were more general requests\nabout a target?s contacts. Requestors submitted leads to discover new\ninvestigative leads. Contact chaining requests were documented from the\ninception of the PSP.\n\nApprovals to Chain. Prior to chaining, NSA\ncounterterrorism shift coordinators reviewed chaining requests to\ndetermine whether they met criteria provided by the OGC and based on the\nterms of the Authorization. They had to have enough information to\nidentify a terrorism nexus and demonstrate compliance with criteria\nrequired by the Authorization before analysis could begin. Shift\ncoordinators either approved requests, approved them for l-hop (direct\ncontact) analysis, or denied them. Approved requests were passed to\nfor contact chaining.\n\nAnalysis. NSA used a variety of tools to conduct\nmetadata analysis and View the results. primary tool for conducting\nmetadata analysis, for PSP and traditional SIGINT collection, was\nMAINWAY. MAINWAY was used for storage, contact chaining, and for\nanalyzing large volumes of global communications metadata. At the\nbeginning of the PSP, only the Navigator? tool was available to\nView MAINWAY output. Over time, new tools and new processes, such as\nautomated chaining alerting, were created to improve efficiency.\nTo obtain the most complete results, used data collected under PSP\nand non-PSP authorities. Typically, they analyzed networks with two\ndegrees of separation (two hops) from the target. determined if\nresulting information was reportable.\n\nF) In addition, an automated chaining alert process was\ncreated to alert of new potentially reportable selectors. Previously\napproved selectors were compared to incoming MAINWAY data\nauthorized by the PSP, E.O. 12333, or the FISC. Alerts of direct contacts\nwith approved selectors were reported to NSA for further analysis\nand potential reporting to FBI and CIA.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV 0F ORN\n\nI4\n\n(U) Content\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAVOF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nStorage. NSA stored metadata obtained under PSP\nauthorities in a protected database. Only cleared and trained were\ngiven access to PSP metadata.\n\nReporting. Reports based on metadata analysis were\ntypically referred to as ?tippers.? Tippers contained contact chaining\nanalysis results relevant to terrorism or with potential links to terrorism that\nwarranted the attention of the FBI or the CIA for further investigation.\nBefore releasing reports with US. person information, obtained\npermission to do so in accordance with established NSA dissemination\nprocedures.\n\nFor each published report, NSA retained documentation\nof the analysis, supporting RFI or lead information, and a justi?cation\nstatement explaining the link to terrorism. If a report was not published,\ndocumentation was not retained. Counterterrorism personnel manually\nupdated information in a computer tracking system to re?ect the\ndisposition of chaining requests.\n\nCollection and analysis of content is traditional wav of\nreporting  SIGINT. Content generally refers to words\nspoken during a telephone conversation or the written text of an email\nmessage. NSA collection of the content of telephony and Internet\ncommunications under the PSP improved its ability to produce intelligence\non terrorist-related activity. For example, by allowing NSA access to links\ncarrying communications with one end in the United States, NSA\nsigni?cantly increased its access to transiting foreign communications, \nwith both communicants outside the United States. General Hayden\ndescribed this as ?the real gold of the Program.? And, by allowing the\nintercept of international communications, NSA was able to identify threats\nwithin the United States.\n\nFrom the start of the Program until January 2007, NSA issued\n490 reports based on PSP-derived content information. Also, as shown\nbelow, approximately 37,664 telephony and Internet selectors were tasked\nfor\n\nPSP-authorized content collection during that time period. Only 8 percent\nwere U.S. targets. The vast majority\n\n(92 percent) were foreign.\n\nF)\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nApproximate Number of Selectors Targeted for PSP Content Collection\n4 Oct 2001 to 17 Jan 2007 \nU.S. Telephony\nUS.

As such, processes were set up to\nensure strict compliance with the terms of the Authorization. The\nfollowing describes the general process for tasking, collecting, storing and\nreporting telephony and Internet content under the PSP. (See Appendix \nfor a ?owchart of the end-to-end process.)\n\nTasking Approvals. Under the PSP, each domestic\nselector tasked for content collection was formally approved and tracked.\nsubmitted content collection requests, also called tasking\npackages, to the Chief of CT for approval. Tasking packages contained a\nnarrative analysis, conclusion, supporting information, documentation, and\na checklist of package contents. In the Chief ?s absence, the Deputy Chief\nof CT or the Program Manager could approve the requests. The approving\nofficials reviewed the tasking packages to ensure that the proposed target\nand related metadata selectors met criteria in the Authorization. If criteria\nwere not met, the officials requested additional information or denied the\nrequest. In limited cases, collection was approved for speci?c time\nperiods. If the content contained foreign intelligence, the time period for\ncollection would be extended. If it did not, collection was stopped. All\napprovals were documented in tasking packagesCRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nForeign selectors tasked for PSP content collection did not\nrequire formal approvals or tasking packages. were responsible\nfor determining whether a foreign selector met the criteria for foreign\nintelligence \n\nCollection. After a domestic selector was approved for PSP\ncontent collection, it was identi?ed as ?tasked? in the STELLARWIND\nAddresses Database by tasking managers who then emailed a\ncollection tasking request to the SSO Collection Manager for telephony\nand Internet content collection. Foreign selector content collection\nrequests were sent directly to the SSO Collection Manager. They did not\nrequire special approval.\n\n \n\nSSO collection managers were responsible for\nensuring that telephony and Internet content selectors were put on or taken\noff collection. For teiephenj'rtelephonv content selectors, collection\nmanagers sent content collection tasking instructions to private sector\ncompanies. Private sector companies were responsible for implementing\ntasking at front-end devices to obtain the required content collection. For\nInternet content selectors, collection managers sent content tasking\ninstructions directly to equipment installed at\n\ncompany-controlled locations. Collected data was sent back to \nand made available to through the HYBRID voice processing\nsystem for telephony content selectors or the PINWALE database for\nInternet content selectors. SSO collection managers worked with private\nsector companies and the CT Product Line to ensure that collected data was\nas intended and legally authorized.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStorage. Content (voice or dBata) collected under PSP was\nstored in protected partitions in existing NSA databases. Access to the\npartitions was restricted to PSP-cleared personnel.\n\nReporting. After analyzing content data collected under\nPresidential authority and identifying foreign intelligence information,\ncounterterrorism wrote reports. After an initial review within the\nCT Product Line, some reports were sent to SID Oversight and Compliance\nfor a second review for US. person identities. reviewers\ndetermined whether the US. identities in the report were necessary to\nassess or understand the foreign intelligence information being reported _oL\nwas required within the conduct of recipient?s of?cial duties . If an identity\nwas found to be unnecessary, it was not reported. Before any US. person\ninformation was disseminated in reporting, internal NSA approvals were\nobtained as required by United States Signals Intelligence Directive\nSP0018 Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures.\n\n \n\n \n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n17\n\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nInitially, NSA responded to FBI and CIA information\nrequests in email. These initial reports, sometimes called\n?Tippers? or ?Snippets,? were ?hidden in plain sight,? meaning the\ninformation in the report did not reveal the source of the information.\nLater, FBI and CIA wanted to understand how NSA knew certain\ninformation that could not be provided in normal reporting channels.\nEventually, ?tear line? reporting was established. Tear lines are used\nregularly by NSA as a way to report SIGINT-derived information and\nsanitized information in the same report to apprOpriately cleared\nindividuals. The sanitized ?tear line? information conveys the same basic\nfacts as the COMINT?controlled information while hiding COMINT as the\nsource.\n\nDissemination of SIGINT Product\n\n \n\nRegardless of which organization submitted requests or leads\nto NSA, all resulting reports were sent to CIA and FBI. Reports answered\nspeci?c RFI questions or provided new investigative leads developed from\nchaining analysis. Reports contained selectors of interest (potential leads)\nwith potential terrorist connections, not full chaining results. NSA had\nminimal insight into how CIA and FBI used PSP products.\n\n(U) Discovery Requests\n\n \n\n(U) On occasion, the Department of Justice attorneys determine that\nthe facts of a particular matter justify a search of NSA ?les and submit a\nsearch request. In response to those requests or in response to discovery\norders, NSA conducts a search of its databases to locate records that may\nfall within the scope of DoJ?s discovery obligations and Rule 16 of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Typically the search process begins\nwith a written request from including the names and aliases of\nindividuals. NSA attorneys work with personnel trained in the retrieval of\nNSA reports to craft search strategies reasonably designed to identify\nreporting that may be responsive to the request. These search strategies are\nthen used to perform electronic searches repositories of\ndisseminated foreign intelligence reports.

The original Authorization and renewals were kept\nin the NSA Director?s safe, and access to the documents was \ncontrolled. By January 2007, nearly 3,000 people had been briefed\non the PSP, including members of Congress and the FISC.\n\n(U) Access to Legal Reviews\n\n \n\nThe NSA did not have access to the early Office of\nLegal Counsel (OLC) opinions supporting the Attorney General?s\nstatement that the PSP was legal. General Hayden, NSA lawyers, and the\nNSA Inspector General agreed that it was not necessary for them to see the\nearly opinions in order to execute the terms of the Authorization, but felt it\nwould be help?li to do so. NSA was, however, given access and provided\ncomments to the OLC opinion issued in 2004.\n\n(U) Access to Original Legal Review\n\nTwo NSA requests for access to the original OLC legal\nopinion were denied.\n\nFirst Request. NSA General Counsel Robert Deitz stated that\nhe asked the Vice President?s Counsel if he could see the opinion. Even\nthough Mr. Deitz?s request was denied, the Vice President?s Counsel read a\nfew paragraphs of the opinion to him over the classi?ed telephone line]\n\nSecond Request. At a 8 December 2003 meeting with the\nDo] Associate Deputy Attorney General to discuss collection of metadata\nand an upcoming NSA OIG compliance audit, IG and Deputy GC\nrequested to see the OLC legal opinion. The Counsel to the Vice President,\nwho unexpectedly attended the meeting, denied the request and said that\nany request to see the opinion had to come directly from General Hayden.\n\nGeneral Hayden stated he never asked for or read the OLC\nlegal opinion supporting the PSP. The Deputy GC stated that it was his\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n21\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nunderstanding that the opinion was not shared with NSA because it was\nconsidered con?dential legal advice to the President.\n\nThe IG, GC, and Deputy GC agreed that their inability to read\nthe OLC opinion did not prevent or impair them from executing and\noverseeing the Program. They were able to determine legality of the\nProgram independently from Do] (see Appendix D). However, the IG said\nthat he found the secrecy surrounding the legal rationale to be ?odd.?\nSpeci?cally, he said that it was ?strange that NSA was told to execute a\nsecret program that everyone knew presented legal questions, without\nbeing told the underpinning legal theory.? The IG, GC, and Deputy GC all\nstated that they had yet to see the full text of the original OLC opinion.\n\nAccess to the May 2004 Opinion\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, the Associate Deputy Attorney General\nand the OLC Assistant Attorney General visited NSA to receive brie?ngs\non the PSP. On 04 May 2004, NSA, at the request of the OLC Assistant\nAttorney General, provided comments on the draft opinion on the\nLegality of the PSP. The OLC Assistant Attorney General submitted his\nopinion on 06 May 2004.\n\nAccess to the Presidential Authorization\n\n \n\nAs directed by the White House, access to the original\nPresidential authorization and subsequent renewals was controlled.\n\n(C) The Vice President?s Counsel drafted the Authorizations and personally\ndelivered them to NSA. On a few occasions, NSA picked up the\nAuthorization at the White House.\n\n(C) The ?rst Authorization and subsequent renewals were kept in a safe in\nthe Director?s of?ce. Initially, access was limited to General Hayden and a\nfew others, including three OGC attorneys, Program Managers, and certain\noperational personnel. Those with access were not allowed to disseminate\nthe Authorizations.\n\nImportantly, most NSA operations personnel, including the\nChief of the CT Product Line, who approved tasking for content collection,\nwere not allowed to see the actual authorization. Rather, OGC answered\ntargeting, information sharing, and implementation legal questions on an\n?on call? basis for operators. When the Authorization changed, OGC\n\nTOP CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n22\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nsummarized those changes in emails distributed to key program executives\nor communicated changes in due diligence meetings.\n\nF) Such limited access to the Authorization was documented\nin an IG investigation as a primary cause of two early violations of the\nAuthorization. At the recommendation, in March 2003, General\nHayden began issuing Delegation of Authority letters that explained the\nAuthorization as it applied to executing the Program. A new Delegation of\nAuthority was promulgated with each renewal of the Authorization. The\nDelegation of Authority letters were sent to the Program Manager and the\ntwo managers of the SID CT Product Line and not further disseminated.\n(See Section Six.)\n\n(U) Access to Program Information\n\n \n\nBetween 4 October 2001 and 17 January 2007, NSA\ncleared over 3,000 people for the PSP.

General Hayden said he told the Vice President that he had no\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n24\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nconcerns about the lawfulness of the Authorization but worried about the\npolitics. After some hesitancy, the White House gave General Hayden\npermission to brief certain members of Congress. In addition, the Chief\nJudge of the FISC was ?rst cleared in January 2002 (see Section \n\nInteractions with Members of Congress. Between 25\nOctober 2001 and 17 January 2007, General Hayden, sometimes supported\nby operational target experts from the CT Product Line and SSO office,\nconducted over 49 brie?ngs to members of Congress or their staff. (See\nAppedix for a complete list of brie?ngs.)\n\nGeneral Hayden ?rst briefed the following members of\nCongress on 25 October 2001:\n\nChair - House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\n\nRanking Minority Member of the House Permanent Select\nCommittee on Intelligence\n\nChair Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\nVice Chair Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n\nIn addition, NSA received and responded to a variety of\nProgram-related inquiries from members of Congress, including Senators\nInouye, Stevens, Pelosi, and Rockefeller.\n\nGeneral Hayden always believed that the PSP was legal. He\nsaid that during the many PSP-related brie?ngs he gave to members of\nCongress, no one ever said that NSA should stop what it was doing. He\nemphasized that he did not just \"?ip through slides\" during the brie?ngs.\nThey lasted as long as attendees desired.\n\nInteractions with the FISC. On 31 January 2002, Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth was briefed on the PSP and on 17 May 2002, his\n\nsuccessor, Colleen Kollar?Kotelly, was briefed. A law clerk was also\nbriefed in April 2004. (See Section Five.)\n\nThe Clearance Process\n\nF) NSA managed the NSA clearance process. Clearance\nrequests were submitted to the PSP Program Office for Program Manager\napproval or disapproval. Access was granted only to those who needed it\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n25\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nto perform assigned job duties. The Program Manager questioned access\nrequests with unclear justi?cations. Approved requests were forwarded to\nthe Program security officer, who performed a security check. If the\nsecurity check yielded nothing to impede access, individuals were\ninstructed to go to the security office to read the ?Security Pre-Brief\nAgreement? and sign a ?Sensitive Compartmented Information\nNondisclosure Agreement? form. General Counsel also had the\nauthority to read in Attorneys ?om other agencies.\n\nOn 20 May 2005, the Program Manager changed the PSP\nclearance request and re-certi?cation process. The Project Security Of?cer\nassigned to Special Source Operations in the SIGINT Directorate assumed\nresponsibility for the PSP clearance process. (Special Source Operations\nmanaged all PSP-related collection for NSA.) Additionally, the Program\nManager initiated PSP clearance brie?ngs.\n\nFrom 4 October 2001 until 23 May 2005, a two-level PSP\nclearance structure was used. One level was limited to the ?fact of?\nProgram existence. A second level included access to PSP targeting data\nthrough a ?must know? principle. Access lists were maintained in the SSO\nSecurity Director?s of?ce on an internal SSO compartmented LAN.\n\nRegular zero-based reviews were conducted by the SSO\nSecurity Director?s of?ce quarterly to validate that cleared individuals had\na continuing need for access to PSP information. The clearance did not\nautomatically transfer with individuals who moved to new assignments.\nThe clearance had to be re-justi?ed for the new position, or the individual\nwould be debriefed from the Program.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) FOUR: NSA PRIVATE SECTOR RELATIONSHIPS\n\nTo conduct foreign intelligence-gathering activities\nunder the PSP, NSA required the assistance of private companies,\nwhich provided access to international communications chokepoints\nin United States. Immediately after 11 September 2001, some private\ncompanies contacted NSA to offer support. Subsequent to PSP\nauthorization, NSA sent request letters to companies stating that\ntheir assistance was authorized by the President with legal\nconcurrence of the Attorney General.\n\n(U) Need for Private Sector Cooperation\n\n \n\nThe United States carries out foreign intelligence activities\nthrough a variety of means. One of the most effective means is to partner\nwith commercial entities to obtain access to information that would not\notherwise be available.\n\nTelephony\n\nMost international telephone calls are routed through a small\nnumber of switches or ?chokepoints? in the international telephone\nswitching system en route to their ?nal destination. The United States is a\nmajor crossroads for international switched telephone traf?c. For example,\nin 2003, circuit switches worldwide carried approximately 180 billion\nminutes of telephone communications. Twenty percent of this amount,\nover 37 billion minutes, either originated or terminated in the United\nStates, and another thirteen percent, over 23 billion minutes, transited the\nUnited States (neither originating nor terminating here). is\nauthorized under Executive Order 12333 to acquire transiting telephone\ncalls]\n\nSll/N F) NSA determined that under the Authorization it could gain\naccess to approximately 81% of the international calls into and out of the\nUnited States through three corporate partners: COMPANY A had access to\n39%, COMPANY 28%, and COMPANY 14%. NSA did not seek\nassistance from local exchange carriers, because that would have given\nNSA access primarily to domestic calls.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n27\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nInternet Communications\n\nF) Al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations have made\nextensive use of the Internet. It is their preferred method of\ncommunication. Terrorists use Internet communications, particularly web-\nbased services, because they are ubiquitous, anonymous, and usually free\nof charge. They can access Web-based email accounts and similar services\nfrom any origination point around the world.\n\nThe United States is a major Internet communications hub.\nThe industry standard for characterization of the volume of Internet\ncommunications is bandwidth, which measures the amount of digital data\ntransmitted in one second bits per second or bps. For example, data\navailable from 2002 shows that at that time, worldwide international\nbandwidth was more than 290 Gbps7. Of that total, less than 2.5\nwas between two regions that did not include the United States.\n\nThe United States is also home to computer servers providing\nInternet communications services often used by terrorists. The majority of\nknown terrorist email addresses that NSA has tracked are hosted on U.S.-\n\nbased providers or forei n-mana ed roviders hosted on servers in the\nUnited  (cab\n\nEvolution of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n\n \n\n(U) History of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n\nAs far back as World War II, NSA has had classi?ed\nrelationships with carefully vetted US. companies that assist with essential\nforeign intelligence?gathering activities. NSA maintains relationships with\nover 100 US. companies. Without their cooperation, NSA would not be\nable respond to intelligence requirements on a variety of topics important\nto the United States.\n\nTwo of the most productive SIGINT collection partnerships\nthat NSA has with the private sector are with COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY B. These two relationships enable NSA to access large\nvolumes of foreign-to-foreign communications transiting the United States\n\n \n\nis an abbreviation for Gigabits per second, which can also be described as one billion bits per second\nor 1,000,000,000 bps.\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n28\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nthrough ?ber-optic cables, gateway switches, and data networks. They also\nprovide foreign intelligence authorized under the FISA.\n\nAccording to General Alexander, General Hayden?s\nreplacement as Director of if the relationships with these\ncompanies were ever terminated, the US. SIGINT system would be\nirrevocably damaged, because NSA would have sacri?ced America?s home\n?eld advantage as the primary hub for worldwide telecommunications.\n\n(U) Partnerships after 11 September 2001\n\nAccording to the former Deputy Chief of SSO, between 11\nSeptember 2001 and the 4 October 2001 Authorization, COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY contacted NSA and asked ?what can we do to help??\nCOMPANY personnel approached NSA SSO personnel through an\nexisting program. They said they noticed odd patterns in domestic calling\nrecords surrounding the events of 11 September and offered call records\nand analysis. With no appropriate authority under which to accept the call\nrecords, NSA suggested the company contact the FBI.\n\n(UIIFOUO) Partnerships Supporting the PSP\n\nOnce the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, NSA\nbegan a process of identifying and visiting commercial entities requesting\ntheir support. While requesting help from corporate entities to support the\nPSP, NSA personnel made it clear that the PSP was a cooperative program\nand participation was voluntary. NSA knew that the PSP was an\nextraordinary program and understood if companies viewed it as too much\nof a liability.\n\nNSA Approaches to Private Sector Companies\n\n2001: On Columbus Day, 8 October 2001, NSA Special\nSource Operations (SSO) personnel responsible for the access relationships\nwith corporate partners COMPANY A, COMPANY B, and COMPANY \nwere called in to work and informed that the President had authorized the\nPSP on 4 October 2001. The SSO personnel were tasked with initiating a\ndialog with the respective TS/SCI-cleared of?cials from COMPANIES A,\nB, and to seek their c00peration under the new Authorization. Over the\nnext few business days, SSO personnel met separately with officials from\nthe three companies. Each company agreed to cooperate.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\n29\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nUpon con?rmation that formal NSA letters requesting their\nassistance were forthcoming, the providers, acting independently and\nof?cially unaware of the cooperating agreements with other companies,\ninitiated collection to support the PSP.\n\n2002: In early 2002, NSA SSO personnel met with the Senior\nVice President of Government Systems and other employees from\nCOMPANY E. Under the authority of the PSP, NSA asked COMPANY \nto provide call detail records (CDR) in support of security for the 2002\nOlympics in Salt Lake City. On 11 February 2002, the company?s CEO\nagreed to cooperate with NSA. On 19 February 2002, COMPANY \nsubmitted a written proposal that discussed methods it could use to\nregularly replicate call record information stored in a COMPANY facility\nand potentially forward the same information to NSA. Discussions with\nCOMPANY continued in 2003. However, the COMPANY General\nCounsel ultimately decided not to support NSA.\n\nOn 5 September 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with intemet provider COMPANY D?s General Counsel to discuss the\nPSP and ask for the company?s support. COMPANY provided support,\nbut it was minimal. (For a description of COMPANY D?s support, see\npage ?What Providers \n\nOn 29 October 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with intemet provider COMPANY F?s Legal and Corporate A?airs\npersonnel, and a former NSA OGC employee hired by COMPANY as\nindependent counsel. NSA requested COMPANY F?s support under the\nPSP for email content. At the meeting, COMPANY requested a letter\nfrom the Attorney General certifying the legality of the PSP. In December\n2002, Commercial Technologies Group was informed that the\ncompany?s CEO agreed to support the PSP. According to General\nCounsel, COMPANY did not participate in the PSP because of corporate\nliability concerns.\n\nF) 2003: In April 2003, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with the President and Chief Operating Of?cer, General Counsel, and\nother personnel from private sector COMPANY G. After the meeting, the\ncompany?s General Counsel wanted to seek the opinion of outside counsel.\nNSA determined the risk associated with additional disclosure outweighed\nwhat COMPANY would have provided. NSA decided to not pursue a\npartnership with this company.\n\nTOP SECRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n30\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nNSA Letters to Private Sector\n\nF) The Director sent letters to private sector companies\nrequesting their assistance with the PSP. NSA OGC drafted the letters for\nthe Director, tracked each renewal of the President?sguthorization and\nmodi?ed the letters accordingly, and ensured the letters were delivered to\nthe companies. Between 16 October 2001 and 14 December 2006, NSA\nsent 147 request-for?assistance letters to private sector partners.\n\nCOMPANY A: 44 Letters\nCOMPANY B: 44 Letters\nCOMPANY c: 46 Letters\nCOMPANY D: 11 Letters\nCONIPANY E: 2 Letters\n\nF) 2001. In his ?rst PSP-related letter on 16 October 2001\nto COMPANIES A, and C, General Hayden stated that the National\nSecurity Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation required their\nassistance ?to collect intelligence vital to the national security arising from\nthe events of 11 September 2001,? and speci?cally requested that they\n?provide survey, tasking and collection against international traffic, some\nof which terminates in the United States; provide aggregated call record\ninformation; and supply computer to computer data which can be used to\ndetermine the communicants.? Their assistance was ?needed to identify\nmembers of international terrorist cells in the United States and prevent\nfuture terrorist attacks against the United States.? These ?rst letters also\nstated that the requested assistance was authorized by the President with\nthe legal concurrence of the Attorney General, pursuant to Article II of the\nConstitution.\n\n2002: Subsequent letters were sent to COMPANIES A,\nB, and by General Hayden (or his deputy) each time the President\nreauthorized the PSP. Throughout 2002, these written requests for\nassistance referenced the 16 October letter; repeated the need to provide\nthe Presidentially-authorized assistance; emphasized that such assistance\nwas necessary to counter a future terrorist attack; and stated that such\nassistance was reviewed by the Attorney General and had been determined\nto be a lawful exercise of the President?s powers as Commander-in-Chief.\nStarting in mid-2003, the wording of the letters was revised but in\nsubstance remained the same.\n\nF) Two request letters for assistance were sent to private\nsector COMPANY E.

The ?rst\nletter was on 9 October 2002 and the last letter was 11 September 2003.\nAll letters were signed by General Hayden or his designee.\n\n2003: In June 2003, COMPANY C?s General Counsel\nand Chief of Staif requested a written Attorney General opinion on the\nlegality and lawfulness of the PSP, to include a directive to comply.\nCOMPANY cited corporate liability concerns as their reason. On 8\nAugust 2003, the Attorney General sent COMPANY a letter stating that\nthe request for support was a lawful exercise of authorities assigned to the\nPresident under Article II of the Constitution. Additionally, the Attorney\nGeneral directed COMPANY to comply with request.\n\nF) 2004: On 26 March 2004, the President amended his 11\nMarch 2004 authorization after deciding to discontinue bulk collection of\nInternet metadata. Before 11 March 2004, all authorizations covering\nlntemet metadata collection (as well as content collection and telephony\nmetadata collection) were approved for form and legality by the Attorney\nGeneral. Accordingly, 12 March 2004 letters to the companies\nstated that the most recent authorization had been approved for form and\nlegality by the Counsel to the President, not the Attorney General as with\nprevious authorizations.\n\n2005: Beginning 19 September 2005 through 14\nDecember 2006, new Director General Alexander, or his\ndesignee, signed the request letters to the companies.\n\n2006 Attorney General Letters.

COMPANY sometimes picked up its\nletters at NSA Headquarters. Letters for COMPANY were stored at NSA\nsince no one at the company had the proper clearance to store them.\n\nPSPAuthorized'Support to NSA\n\nPrivate sector companies provided assistance to NSA\nunder the PSP in three categories: telephone and lntemet Protocol content,\nMetadata from Call Detail Records, and lntemet Protocol Metadata.\n\nF) The PSP allowed content to be collected if the selected\ncommunication was one-end foreign or the location of the communicants\ncould not be determined. Selectors (email addresses and telephone\nnumbers) were provided by Of?ce of Counterterrorism.\n\nF) Content: Telephony. Under the PSP, companies\nprovided the content of one?end-foreign international telephone calls\n(telephony content) and the content of electronic communications (email\ncontent) of al Qaeda and its af?liates. COMPANIES A, B, and provided\ntelephony content from communications links they owned and operated.\nThey had been providing telephony content to NSA before 2001 under\nFISA and E.O. 12333 authorities. NSA began to receive telephony content\nfrom COMPANIES A and on 6 October 2001 and COMPANY on 7\nOctober 2001. This support ended on 17 January 2007.\n\nContent: Internet Email. COMPANIES A, B, and \nprovided access to the content of Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda-af?liate email\nfrom communication links they owned and operated. NSA received email\ncontent from COMPANY A as early as October 2001 until 17 January\n2007, from Company beginning February-March 2002 through 17\nJanuary 2007, and from COMPANY from April 2005 until 17 January\n2007. From April 2003 through November 2003, COMPANY provided\na limited amount of email content under the PSP. It did not provide PSP-\nrelated support after November 2003, but it did provide support under\nFISA.\n\nMetadata from Call Detail Records. COMPANIES A\nand provided Call Detail Records to NSA. The records were used by\nNSA Counter?Terrorism metadata to perform call chaining and\nnetwork reconstruction between known al Qaeda and al Qaeda-affiliate\ntelephone numbers and previously unknown telephone numbers with which\nthey had been in contact. Providers generated Call Detail Records as a\nnormal course of doing business billing purposes and traf?c\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\n33\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE TL OMIN OF ORN\n\nengineering).

The Call Detail\nRecords were aggregated as large ?les by TS/SCI?cleared groups at\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY and forwarded, on an hourly or daily\nbasis, across classi?ed communications circuits to a PSP-restricted NSA\ndata repository.\n\nCOMPANY A provided PSP-authorized CDRs as early as November 2001,\nand COMPANY began to provide CDRs in February 2002. Both\ncontinued to provide this support through the end of the PSP, and support\ncontinues today under the FISC Business Records Order. COMPANY \nprovided select PSP-authorized CDRs from December 2002 through March\n2003.\n\nF) Internet Metadata. The last category of private sector\nassistance was access to lntemet Protocol (IP) metadata associated with\ncommunications of al Qaeda (and af?liates) from data links owned or\noperated by COMPANIES A, B, and C. In order to be a candidate for PSP\nIP metadata collection, data links were ?rst vetted to ensure that the\npreponderance of communications was from foreign sources, and that there\nwas a high probability of collecting al Qaeda (and af?liate)\ncommunications. NSA took great care to ensure that metadata was\nproduced against foreign, not domestic, communications.\n\nCOMPANY A began providing PSP IP metadata\ncollection as early as November 2001. Although COMPANY began\nproviding of PSP 1P metadata in October 2001, an automated\ntransfer of data was not available until February?March 2002. The\nPresidential authority to collect IP metadata was terminated in March 2004.\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY IP metadata collection resumed after the\nFISC Pen Register/Trap Trace Order authorizing this activity\nwas signed on 15 July 2004.

Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who replaced Judge\nLamberth as Chief Judge in May 2002, and one law clerk were the only\nmembers of the FISC that NSA had briefed on the PSP. In the spring of\n2004, NSA's interaction with Judge Kollar-Kotelly increased as NSA and\nDOJ began transitioning PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders in 2004.\nIt was not until after parts of the PSP were publicly revealed in\n\nDecember 2005 that all members of the FISC were briefed on the\nProgram.\n\n(U) Interaction with the FISC\n\n \n\nGeneral Hayden stated that from the start of the PSP, he and\nother NSA leaders recognized the importance of keeping all three branches\nof the Government informed of the Program and pressed the White House\nto do so.\n\nIn all of its interactions, neither NSA nor DOJ presented\nbefore the FISC the factual and legal issues arising from the PSP in any\ncase or controversy. Therefore, the FISC did not express any View or\ncomment on the legality or illegality of the PSP.\n\nNSA Briefings on the PSP to Members of the FISC\n\nF) The White House ?rst permitted NSA to brief the Chief Judge\nof the FISC in January 2002. General Hayden stated that on 31 January\n2002, he provided Judge Lamberth a very detailed PSP brie?ng, and the\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General in the DOJ OLC explained the\nProgram?s legality. General Hayden stated that this brie?ng was prompted\nby a concern expressed by DOJ that PSP-derived information would be\nused in FISA applications\n\nOn 17 May 2002, General Hayden briefed incoming Chief\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly, with Judge Lamberth in attendance, on the PSP. In a\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\n36\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nletter to the Counsel for Intelligence Policy dated 12 January 2005, Judge\nKollar?Kotelly stated that, on that date, she was also shown a short legal\nmemorandum, prepared by the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the\nDOJ, OLC, that set out a broad overview of the legal authority for\nconducting the PSP. Judge Kollar?Kotelly added that she was allowed to\nread the memorandum but not to retain it for study.\n\nNSA records show that Judge Kollar?Kotelly was briefed\nagain on 12 August 2002 at the White House. Although we found no\ndocumentation of the purpose of the meeting or topics discussed, Judge\nKollar-Kotelly stated in the January 2005 letter to the Counsel for\nIntelligence Policy that, at her request, she was permitted to review the\nAuthorization of the PSP on that date.\n\nIn response to a New York Times ?warrantless wiretapping?\nstory published in December 2005, General Alexander briefed all FISC\nmembers on the PSP on 9 January 2006.9\n\n(U) Transition of PSP Authorities to FISC Orders\n\n \n\nThe transition of PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders\nwas precipitated by preliminary results of OLC legal review of the\ncomponents of the Program. In March 2004, OLC found three of the four\ntypes of collection authorized under the PSP to be legally supportable.\nHowever, it determined that, given the method of collection, bulk lntemet\nmetadata was prohibited by the terms of FISA and Title \nConsequently, the White House Counsel rather than the Attorney General\nsigned the 11 March 2004 Authorization.\n\n \n\nNSA Implements Controversial\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9 Scullin did not attend this brie?ng, but was later briefed on 31 January 2006.\nJudge Bates, a new judge, was briefed on 21 March 2006.\n\nOLC ultimately issued three opinions: 15 March 2004, 6 May 2004, and 16 July\n2004.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\n37\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\n \n\n \n\nUntil March 2004, NSA considered its\ncollection of bulk Internet metadata under the PSP to be\nlegal and appropriate. Speci?cally, NSA leadership,\nincluding OGC lawyers and the IG, interpreted the terms of\nthe Authorization to allow NSA to obtain bulk Internet\nmetadata for analysis because NSA did not actually\n?acquire? communications until speci?c communications\nwere selected. In other words, because the Authorization\npermitted NSA to conduct metadata analysis on Selectors\nthat met certain criteria, it implicitly authorized NSA to\nobtain the bulk data that was needed to conduct the\nmetadata analysis.\n\nOn 11 March 2004, General Hayden had to\ndecide whether NSA would execute the Authorization\nwithout the Attorney General?s signature 11).\nGeneral Hayden described a conversation in which David\nAddington asked, ?Will you do it (I 11 At that time,\nGeneral Hayden also said that he asked Daniel Levin,\nCounsel to the Attorney General, in March 2004 if he\nneeded to stop anything he was doing. Mr. Levin said that\nhe did not need to stop anything (I and lV-A/32a-\nAfter conferring with NSA operational and legal\npersonnel, General Hayden stated that he decided to\ncontinue the PSP because 1) the members of Congress he\nbriefed the previous day, 10 March, were supportive of\ncontinuing the Program, 2) he knew the value of the\nProgram, and 3) NSA lawyers had determined the Program\nwas legal.\n\n \n\nEight days later on 19 March 2004, the President rescinded the\nauthority to collect bulk lntemet metadata and gave NSA one week to stop\ncollection and block access to previously collected bulk lntemet metadata. NSA\ndid so on 26 March 2004. To close the resulting collection gap, DOJ and NSA\nimmediately began efforts to recreate this authority in what became the \norder. By January 2007, the remaining three authorities had also been replicated in\nFISC orders: the Business Records (BR) Order, the Foreign Content Order, and the\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ONAV OF ORN\n\n38\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nDomestic Content Order. On 1 February 2007, the ?nal Authorization was allowed\nto expire and was not renewed.\n\nTransition of Internet Metadata Collection to Pen Register/T rap\nand Trace Order Authority\n\nAccording to NSA personnel, the decision to transition\nlntemet metadata collection to a FISC order was driven by Bo]. At a\nmeeting on 26 March 2007, directed NSA representatives from OGC\nand SID to ?nd a legal basis, using a FISC order, to recreate PSP\nauthority to collect bulk lntemet metadata.\n\nAfter extensive coordination, Do] and NSA devised the\ntheory to which the Chief Judge of the FISC seemed amenable.\nDo] and NSA worked closely over the following months, exchanging\ndrafts of the application, preparing declarations, and responding to\nquestions from court advisers. NSA representatives explained the\ncapabilities that were needed to recreate the Authority, and Do] personnel\ndevised a workable legal basis to meet those needs. In April 2004, NSA\nbriefed Judge Kollar-Kotelly and a law clerk because Judge Kollar?Kotelly\nwas researching the impact of using PSP-derived information in FISA\napplications. In May 2004, NSA personnel provided a technical brie?ng\non NSA collection of bulk lntemet metadata to Judge Kollar?Kotelly. In\naddition, General Hayden said he met with Judge Kollar-Kotelly on two\nsuccessive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the on-going\nefforts.\n\nThe ISC signed the ?rst order on 14 July 2004.\nAlthough NSA lost access to the bulk metadata from 26 March 2004 until\nthe order was signed, the order essentially gave NSA the same authority to\ncollect bulk lntemet metadata that it had under the PSP, except that it\nspeci?ed the datalinks from which NSA could collect, and it limited the\nnumber of people that could access the data. The FISC continues to renew\nthe approximately every 90 days.\n\nTransition of Telephony Metadata Collection to the Business\nRecords Order\n\nAccording to NSA General Counsel Vito Potenza, the\ndecision to transition telephony metadata to the Business Records Order\nwas driven by a private sector company. After the New York Times article\nwas published in December 2005, Mr. Potenza stated that one of the PSP\nproviders expressed concern about providing telephony metadata to NSA\nunder Presidential Authority without being compelled. Although \n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n39\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nMay 2004 opinion states that NSA collection of telephony metadata as\nbusiness records under the Authorization was legally supportable, the\nprovider preferred to be compelled to do so by a court order.?\n\nAs with the Order, and NSA collaboratively\ndesigned the application, prepared declarations, and responded to questions\nfrom court advisers. Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT Order\nmade this process more ef?cient.\n\nThe ISC signed the ?rst Business Records Order on 24 May\n2006. The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk\ntelephony metadata from business records that it had under the PSP. And,\nunlike the PRTT, there was no break in collection at transition. The order\ndid, however, limit the number of people that could access the data and\nrequired more stringent oversight by and reporting to DOJ. The FISC\ncontinues to renew the Business Records Order every 90 days or so. (See\nAppendix H.)\n\nTransition of Internet and Telephony Content Collection to the\nForeign and Domestic Content Orders\n\nAccording to NSA OGC, the transition of PSP content\ncollection to FISC orders was driven by had contemplated a\ntransition in July 2004 when the signing of the order\nindicated its willingness to authorize PSP activities under court order.\nGiven this precedent, concluded the FISC might also accept content\ncollection. However, little progress was made until June 2005 when the\nOIPR with NSA OGC and SID representatives began researching the\nfeasibility of collecting PSP content under court order. In essence, DOJ\nand NSA needed to ?nd a legal theory that would allow NSA to add and\ndrop thousands of foreign targets for content collection. Because the law\nwas more restrictive for content than metadata, NSA had serious\nreservations about whether it would be possible to ?nd a workable solution\nusing a FISC order at that time, especially given the large number of\nselectors to be tasked and the complexity from legal and operational\nperspectives. For example:\n\n \n\nIn addition to the telephony metdata that NSA was receiving from private sector\ncompanies as business records, it was also obtaining ?live? telephony metadata from its own SIGINT\ncollection sources. It continued until mid-2005. will include a reference to the corresponding\n\nnoti?cation here.** \n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN 0F ORN\n\n40\n\nTOP SECRE ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nNSA risked losing ?exibility in the means of\ncollection, given that facilities and collection accesses were\ncomplex and in constant ?ux.\n\nF) In executing the and Business Records Orders,\nthe and DoJ?s consistently increasing demands for\ninformation took NSA away from target-related duties.\n\nThe process imposed by the FISA statute was not able\nto handle the large volume of NSA requests for FISC authorization\nneeded after\n11 September 2001.\n\nBecause May 2004 opinion found that the\nexisting Authorization for content collection was lawful, there was\nno pressing need to ?nd an alternative legal vehicle.\n\nIn a letter dated 21 February 2006, the NSA GC expressed the\naforementioned concerns, among others, to the Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral suggesting that:\n\n. . . . now might be the right time to seek substantial revisions to\nthe FISA. The purpose of the legislation was to protect the\nprivacy of US. persons who could be subjected to surveillance,\neither intentionally or incidentally. Twenty-seven years later, the\nUnited States Government ?nds itself obtaining FISA orders so\nthat it can carry out surveillance on foreign intelligence targets\nwho are outside the United States and, more often than not,\ncommunicating only with others outside the United States. This\nserves no US. person?s privacy interests, was never anticipated by\nthe statute?s drafters, and diverts valuable resources from the ?ght\nagainst terrorism. The FISA needs to be simpli?ed and\nstreamlined.?\n\nUltimately, decided to pursue a FISC order for content\ncollection wherein the traditional FISA de?nition of a ?facility? as a\nspeci?c telephone number or email address was changed to encompass the\ngateway or cable head that foreign targets use for communications.\nMinimization and probable cause standards would then be applied. As\nwith the PRTT and Business Records orders, NSA collaborated with Do] to\nprepare the application and declarations and provided the operational\nrequirements needed to continue effective surveillance.\n\nAfter 18 months of concerted effort and coordination, the\nFISC ultimately accepted the theory for foreign selectors but rejected it for\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n41\n\n1109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\ndomestic selectors. Consequently, on 10 January 2007, the FISC signed\ntwo separate orders: the Foreign Content Order and the Domestic Content\nOrder.\n\nThe Foreign Content Order negatively affected SIGINT\nexploitation. Most notably, the number of foreign selectors on collection\ndropped by 73 percent, from 11,000 selectors under PSP to 3,000 under the\norder. In addition, the administrative workload for NSA to put\ncritical foreign selectors on collection was so burdensome that the order\nbecame operationally unsustainable. The order was eventually superseded\nby Congress? FISA modernization. It was temporarily replaced by the\nProtect America Act in August 2007 and then permanently replaced by the\nFISA Amendments Act in July 2008.\n\nF) The Domestic Content Order did not create a similar loss in\ncollection because so few domestic numbers were tasked at that time. It\ndid, however, slow operations because of the documentation required, and\nit took considerably longer to task under the order than under the PSP.\nOver time, the scope of the Domestic Content Order gradually decreased to\na single selector tasked for collection in January 2009. In January 2009,\nthe FBI, at request, assumed responsibility for the Domestic Content\nOrder and became the declarant before the FISCCRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) SIX: NSA OVERSIGHT OF PSP SIGINT ACTIVITIES\n\nNSA Of?ce of General Counsel and SID, Oversight and\nCompliance provided oversight of NSA PSP activities from October 2001\nuntil January 2007. NSA OIG initiated PSP oversight in 2002.\n\n(U) Office of General Counsel\n\n \n\nThe OGC was the ?rst NSA organization with oversight\nresponsibilities to learn of the PSP, and it continued to provide signi?cant\noversight over the life of the Program. The GC was briefed on 4 October\n2001, the day the Authorization was signed. On 6 October, he gave the\nDirector and Deputy Director talking points for brie?ng NSA personnel on\nthe new authority. The talking points included the fact that General\nHayden had instructed the GC and the lead attorney for operations to\nconduct routine review and oversight of PSP activities.\n\nThe NSA Assistant General Counsel for Operations provided\nmost of the Program oversight before the OIG learned of the PSP in 2002.\nHe and his successors reviewed proposed target packages and rejected\nthose not compliant with the Authorization, answered questions, gave\nbrie?ngs, reviewed program implementation, and coordinated program-\nrelated issues with \n\n(U) SIGINT Directorate\n\n \n\nThe SIGINT Directorate Office of Oversight and Compliance\nrepresents the Director and the Signals Intelligence\nDirector in overseeing compliance with authorities that govern the\ncollection, production, and dissemination of intelligence by the National\nSecurity Agency. The Chief of was briefed on the PSP on 10\nOctober 2001. Initially, ability to provide effective oversight was\nlimited by insufficient staffing and a lack of methodologies to provide\nmeaningful oversight of PSP collection. It, therefore, focused on\nidentifying problem areas while documenting program activity. It also\nhelped establish database partitions and assisted with data ?ow compliance\nissues to prevent uncleared personnel from seeing Presidentially-authorized\ncollection. Later, it reviewed justi?cation statements for tasked selectors.\nAlso, it directed PSP-cleared SIGINT operations personnel to follow\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n43\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n7109-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nestablished procedures for the dissemination of US. person information\nand obtained approvals to permit dissemination of US. person information\n\n(U) Office of Inspector General\n\n \n\nNSA OIG conducted oversight of PSP activities from August\n2002 until the Program ended in January 2007. It issued 12 formal reports\nand 14 Presidential Noti?cations on PSP activities at NSA.\n\nInvestigations were conducted in response to speci?c incidents or\nviolations to determine the cause, effect, and remedy.\n\nReviews were conducted to determine the adequacy of management\ncontrols to ensure compliance with the Authorization and related\nauthorities; to assess the ef?ciency and effectiveness in mitigating\nhigh-risk activities associated with the Program; and to identify\nimpediments to satisfying the requirements of the Authorization and\nrelated authorities.\n\nPresidential Noti?cations were drafted for the Director?s signature\nto notify the President?s Counsel about violations of the\nAuthorization. (See below for additional details.)\n\nDue Diligence Meetings were held by program officials\nto exercise ?due diligence? in addressing program issues and\ndevelopments. The OIG attended these meetings to stay aware of\nprogram activities.\n\nOIG also provided oversight of FISC-authorized activity\npreviously conducted under Authorization.\n\nSee Appendix for a list of OIG reports on PSP activity at\nNSA.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\n44\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n \n\n(U) NSA [6 Not Cleared until 2002\n\nWe could not determine exact reasons for\nwhy the NSA was not cleared for the PSP until\nAugust 2002. According to the NSA General Counsel,\nthe President would not allow the IG to be briefed\nsooner. General Hayden did not speci?cally recall why\nthe was not brought in earlier, but thought that it\nhad not been appropriate to do so when it was\nuncertain how long the Program would last and before\noperations had stabilized. The NSA [6 pointed out\nthat he did not take the 16 position until April 2002, so\nNSA leadership or the White House may have been\nresistant to clearing either a new or an acting lG.\n\nRegardless, by August 2002, General\nHayden and the NSA General Counsel wanted to\ninstitutionalize oversight of the Program by bringing in\nthe IG. General Hayden recalled having to ?make a\ncase? to the White House to clear the at that time.\n\n \n\n \n\nOIG concerns lead to change\n\n(C) In addition to formal recommendations made in review and\ninvestigative reports, OIG concerns about access to the terms of the\nPresidential authorization and about the means of reporting PSP violations\nresulted in three major changes.\n\n(C) First, in December 2002, the IG recommended that General Hayden\nformally delegate authority to NSA operational personnel, some of whom\nhad unknowingly violated terms of the Authorization. The Counsel to the\nVice President, demanding secrecy, re?Jsed to let them see terms of the\nauthority, which had been delegated by the President to the Secretary of\nDefense, who delegated it to the Director of NSA. General Hayden issued\nthe ?rst ?Delegation of Authority? letter to key operational personnel in the\nSID on 4 March 2003. Subsequent delegation letters were issued each time\nthe President renewed the authority.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n45\n\nT-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n(C) Second, in March 2003, the IG advised General Hayden that he should\nreport violations of the Authorization to the President. In February of\n2003, the OIG learned of PSP incidents or violations that had not been\nreported to overseers as required, because none had the clearance to see the\nreport.\n\nBefore March 2003, NSA quarterly reports on\nintelligence activities sent to the President?s Intelligence Oversight Board\n(through the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence\nOversight) stated that the Director was not aware of any unlawful\nsurveillance activities by NSA other than that described in the report.\nBeginning in March 2003, at the direction, NSA quarterly reports\nstated that except as disclosed to the President, the Director was not aware\nof any unlawful surveillance activities by NSA. Also beginning in March\n2003, PSP violations, including those not previously reported to the\nIntelligence Oversight Board, were reported in ?Presidential Noti?cations.?\nThird, shortly after learning about the Program, the IG\nparticipated in a September 2002 meeting of key cleared personnel at\nwhich important PSP matters were discussed. He recommended that these\ntypes of meetings be held every month. As a result, ?due\ndiligence? meetings were held until the Program ended.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN ORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nThis page intentionally left blank.\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n47\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n1109-0002 WORKING DRAFT\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nTOP SE CRE OMIN OF ORN\n\n"

(U)\n\nif NSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these minimization\nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life force protection or\nhostage situations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these\nprocedures, NBA may take such action immediately. NSA will report the action taken to the\nOf?ce of the Director of National Intelligence and to the National Security Division of the\nDepartment of Justice, which will notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt of such activity. (U)\n\nSection 2 Definitions (U)\n\nIn addition to the definitions in sections 101 and 701 of the Act, the following de?nitions\nwill apply to these procedures:\n\na Ac uisition means the collection. NSA or the FBI through electronic means of a non?\n(l 3? a\npublic communication to which it is not an intended patty. (U)\n\nCommunications concerning a United States person include all communications in which\na United States person is discussed or mentioned, except where such communications\nreveal only publicly?available information about the person. (U)\n\n(0) Communications of a United States person include all corrmrunications to which a United\nStates person is a party. (U)\n\nConsent is the agreement by a person or organization to permit the NSA to take particular\nactions that affect the person or organization. To be effective, consent must be given by\nthe affected person or organization with suf?cient knowledge to understand the action\nthat may be taken and the possible consequences of that action. Consent by an\norganization will be deemed. valid if given on behalf of the organization by an of?cial, or\ngoverning body determined by the General Counsel, NSA, to have actual or apparent\nauthority to make such an agreement (U)\n\nDerived From: 1?52\n\nDated: 20070108\n\nDeclassify On: 20320108\n\n\nCOMENTUNOF \n\nForeign communication means a communication that has at least one \noutside of the United States. All other including communications in\nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are reasonably believed to be located in the\nUnited States at the time of acquisition, are domestic \n\nIdenti?cation of a United States person means the name, unique title, address, or other\npersonal identi?er of a United States person in the context of activities conducted by that\nperson or activities conducted by others that are related. to that person. A reference to a\nproduct by brand name, or manufacturer's name or the use of a name in a descriptive\nsense, cg, ?Monroe Doctrine,? is not an identi?cation of a United States person. \n\nProcessed or processing means any step necessary to convert a communication into an\nintelligible form intended for human inspection. (U)\n\nPublicly-available information means information that a member of the public could\nobtain on request, by research in public sources, or by casual observation. (U)\n\nTechnical data base means information retained for traf?c analytic, or\nsignal exploitation purposes. \n\nUnited States person means a United States person as de?ned in the Act. The following\nguidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is unknown is a United\nStates person: (U)\n\nA person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United States\nperson unless positively identi?ed as an alien who has not been admitted for\npermanent residence, or unless the nature or circumstances of the person's\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a United\nStates person. (U)\n\n(2) A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is\nunknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be\npositively identified as such, or the nature or circumstances of the person?s\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States\nperson. (U)\n\n(3) A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence loses status as a\nUnited States person if the person leaves the United States and is not in compliance\nwith 8 U.S.C. 1203 enabling re-entry into the United States. Failure to follow the\nstatutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that the alien has\nabandoned any intention of maintaining his status as a permanent resident alien. (U)\n\n(4) An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located\noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is\ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the\nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. (U)\n\n\n2\n\n30108\n\nSection 3 Acquisition and Processing General (U)\n(3.) Acquisition (U)\n\nThe acquisition of information by targeting non?United States persons reasonably believed to\nbe located outside the United States pursuant to section 702 of the Act will be effected in\naccordance with an authorization made by the Attorney General and Director of National\nIntelligence pursuant to subsection 702(a) of the Act and will be conducted in a manner\ndesigned, to the greatest extent reasonably feasible, to minimize the acquisition of\ninformation not relevant to the authorized purpose of the acquisition. \n\nMonitoring, Recording, and Processing (U)\n\n(1) Personnel will exercise reasonable judgment in determining Whether infonnation\nacquired must be minimized and will destroy inadvertently acquired communications\nof or concenring a United States person at the earliest practicable point in the\nprocessing cycle at which such. can be identi?ed either: as clearly not\nrelevant to the authorized purpose of the acquisition the communication does\nnot contain foreign intelligence information); or, as not containing evidence of a\ncrime which may be disseminated under these procedures. Such inadvertently\nacquired communications of or concerning a United States person may be retained no\nlonger than ?ve years in any event. The communications that may be retained\ninclude electronic communications acquired because of limitations on ability\nto ?lter communications. \n\n(2) Communications of or concerning United States persons that may be related to the\nauthorized purpose of the acquisition may be forwarded to analytic personnel\nresponsible for producing intelligence information from the collected data. Such\nor information may be retained and disseminated only in accordance\nwith Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of these procedures. (C)\n\n(3) Magnetic tapes or other storage media that contain acquired communications may be\nprocessed. (S)\n\n(4) As a communication is reviewed, NSA analyst(s) will determine Whether it is a\ndomestic or foreign cormnunication to, from, orahout a target and is reasonably\nbelieved to contain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime. Only\nsuch communications may be processed. All other communications may be retained\nor disseminated only in accordance with Sections 5 6, and 8 of these procedures.\nI)\n\n(5) Magnetic tapes or other storage media containing acquired pursuant\nto section 702 may be scanned by computer to identify and select communications for\nanalysis. Computer selection terms used for scanning, such as telephone numbers,\nkey words or phrases, or other discriminators, will not include United States person\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nnames or identi?ers and will be limited to those selection terms reasonably likely to\nreturn information about foreign intelligence targets. (S/lSl)\n\n(6) Further processing, retention and dissemination of foreign communications will be\nmade in accordance with Sections 4, 6, 7, and, 8 as applicable, below. Further\nprocessing, storage and dissemination of inadvertently acquired domestic\ncommunications will be made in accordance with Sections 4, 5, and 8 below. SI)\n\nDestruction of Raw Data (C)\n\nCommunications and other information, including that reduced to graphic or \"hard copy\"\nform such as facsimile, telex, computer data, or equipment emanations, will be reviewed for\nretention in accordance with the standards set forth in these procedures. \nand other information, in any form, that do not meet such retention standards and that are\nknown to contain communications of or concerning United States persons will be destroyed\nupon recognition, and may be retained no longer than five years in any event. The\ncommunications that may be retained include electronic communications acquired because of\nlimitations on NSA's ability to ?lter communications. \n\nChange in Target?s Location or Status \n\n(1) In the event that NSA determines that a person is reasonably believed. to be located\noutside the United States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside\nthe United. States, or if NSA concludes that a person who at the time of targeting was\nbelieved to be a non?United States person is in fact a United States person, the\nacquisition from that person will be terminated without delay. SI)\n\n(2) Any communications acquired through the targeting of a person Who at the time of\ntargeting was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States but is in fact\nlocated inside the United States at the time such communications were acquired, and\nany communications acquired by targeting a person who at the time of targeting was\nbelieved to be a non-United States person but was in fact a United States person, will\nbe treated as domestic communications under these procedures. \n\nSection 4 - Acquisition and Processing Attorney~Client Communications (C)\n\nAs soon as it becomes apparent that a communication is between a person who is known to\nbe under criminal indictment in the United States and an attorney who represents that\nindividual in the matter under indictment (or someone acting on behalf of the attorney),\nmonitoring of that communication will cease and the communication will be identified as an\nattomey-client communication in a log maintained for that purpose. The relevant portion of\nthe communication containing that conversation will be segregated and the National Security\nDivision of the Department of Justice will be noti?ed so that appropriate procedures may be\nestablished to protect such. cormnunications from review or use in any criminal prosecution,\nWhile preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein. Additionally, all\nproposed disseminations of information constituting United States person attorneywclient\n\n\n4i\n\n\n\nprivileged communications must be reviewed by the NSA Of?ce of General Counsel prior to\ndissemination. \n\nSection 5 Domestic Commtmications (U)\n\nA identi?ed as a domestic communication will be destroyed upon.\nrecognition unless the Director (or Acting Director) of NSA speci?cally determines, in\nwriting, that: (S)\n\n(1) the is reasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence\ninformation. Such may be provided to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) (including United States person identities) for possible\ndissemination by the FBI in accordance with its minimization procedures; (S)\n\n(2) the communication does not contain foreign intelligence information but is\nreasonably believed to contain evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about\nto be committed. Such communication maybe disseminated (including United States\nperson identities) to approij ate Federal law enforcement authorities, in accordance\nwith 50 U.S.C. l806(b) and 1825(c), Executive Order No. 12333, and, Where\napplicable, the crimes reporting procedures set out in the August 1995 ?Memorandum\nof Understanding: Reporting of lnfonnation Concerning Federal Crimes,\" or any\nsuccessor document. Such cormnunications may be retained by NSA for a reasonable\nperiod of time, not to exceed. six months unless extended in writing by the Attorney\nGeneral, to permit law enforcement agencies to determine whether access to original\nrecordings of such communications is required for law enforcement purposes; (S)\n\n(3) the communication is reasonably believed. to contain technical data base information,\nas defined in Section or information necessary to understand or assess a\ncommunications security vulnerability. Such conununication may be provided to the\nFBI and/or disseminated. to other elements of the United States Government. Such\ncommunications may be retained for a period suf?cient to allow a thorough.\nexploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to\nbecome, relevant to a current or future foreign intelligence requirement. Suf?cient\nduration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. \n\na. In the context of a effort, maintenance of technical data bases\nrequires retention. of all. communications that are enciphered or reasonably\nbelieved to contain secret meaning, and suf?cient duration may consist of any\nperiod of time during which material is subject tothe case of communications that are not enciphered or otherwise thought to\ncontain secret meaning, sufficient duration is ?ve years unless the Signal\nIntelligence Director, NSA, determines in writing that retention for a longer\nperiod is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or\ncounteiintelligence requirements; or \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n(4) the communication contains information pertaining to a threat of serious harm to life\nor property. (8)\n\nNotwithstanding the above, if a domestic communication indicates that a target has entered\n\nthe United States, NSA may advise the FBI of that fact. Moreover, technical data regarding\ndomestic communications may be retained and provided to the FBI and. CIA for collection \navoidance purposes. \n\nSection 6 - Foreign Communications of or Concerning United States Persons (U)\nRetention (U)\n\nForeign communications of or concerning United States persons collected in the course of an\nacquisition authorized under section 702 of the Act may be retained only:\n\n(1) if necessary for the maintenance of technical data bases. Retention for this purpose is\npermitted for a period suf?cient to allow a thorough exploitation and. to permit access\nto data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or\nfuture foreign intelligence requirement. Suf?cient duration may vary with the nature\nof the exploitation.\n\na.

(U) 0F WHETHER THE ACQUESETEGN TARGETS \nUNITED STATES PERSONS REASONABLY BELEEVED TO BE LOCATED OUTSEDE\nTHE UNITED \n\n(S) NSA determines Whether a person. is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be\noutside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the information\navailable with respect to that person, including information concerning the communications\nfacility or facilities used by that person.\n\n(8) NSA examine the following three categories of information, as appropriate under the\ncircumstances, to make the above determination: (1) they examine the lead information they\nhave received regarding the potential target or the facility that has generated interest in\nconducting surveillance to determine what that lead information discloses about the person's\nlocation; (2) they conduct research in NSA databases, available reports and collateral\ninfonnation information to which NSA has access but did not originate, such as reports\nfrom other agencies and publicly available information) to determine whether NSA knows the\nlocation of the person, or knows information that would provide evidence concerning that\nlocation; and (3) they conduct technical analyses of the facility or facilities to determine or verify\ninformation about the person?s location. NSA may use information from any one or a\ncombination of these categories of information in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to\ndetermine that the potential target is located outside the United States.\n\nin addition, in those cases where NSA seeks to acquire about the\ntarget that are not to or from the target, NSA will either employ an Internet Protocol ?lter to\nensure that the person from whom it seeks to obtain foreign intelligence information is located\n\nDerived From: l?52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20320108\n\nTOP \n\nTOP \n\noverseas, or it will target Internet links that terminate in a foreign country. In either event, NSA\nwill direct surveillance at a party to the communication reasonably believed to be outside the\nUnited States.\n\n(8) Lead Information\n\n(S) When NSA proposes to direct surveillance at a target, it does so because NSA has already\nlearned something about the target or the facility or facilities the target uses to communicate.\nAccordingly, NSA will examine the lead information to determine what it reveals about the\nphysical location of the target, including the location of the facility or facilities being used by the\npotential target.\n\n(S) The following are examples of the types of lead information that NSA may examine:\n\na) Has the target stated that he is located outside the United States? For example, has\nNSA or another intelligence agency collected a statement or statements made by the\ntarget indicating that he is located outside the United States?\n\nb) Has a human intelligence source or other source of lead information indicated that the\ntarget is located outside the United States?\n\n0) Does the lead information provided by an intelligence or law enforcement agency of\nthe United States govemment or an intelligence or law enforcement service of a\nforeign government indicate that the target is located outside the United States?\n\nd) Was the lead information about the target found on a hard drive or other medium that\nwas seized in a foreign country?\n\n6) With whom has the target. had direct contact, and what do we know about the location\nof such persons? For example, if lead information indicates the target is in direct\ncontact with several members of a foreign?based terrorist organization or foreign?\nbased political organization who themselves are located overseas, that may suggest,\ndepending on the totality of the circumstances, that the target is also located overseas.\n\n(S) information NBA Has About the Target?s Location and/or Facility or Facilities Used by\nthe Target\n\n(S) NSA may also review information in its databases, including repositories of information\ncollected by NSA and by other intelligence agencies, as well as publicly available information, to\ndetermine if the person's location, or information providing evidence about the person?s location,\nis already known. The NSA databases that would be used for this puipose contain infoimation\nculled from signals intelligence, human intelligence, law enforcement infonnation, and other\nsources. For example, NSA databases may include a report produced by the Central Intelligence\nAgency (CIA) with the fact that a known terrorist is using a telephone with a particular number,\nor detailed information on worldwide telephony numbering plans for wire and wireless telephone\nsystems.\n\nTOP \n2\n\nTOP SECRETHCOMENTHNOFORNHZ032G168\n\n(S) NSA rfeehnical Analysis of the Facility\n\n(S) NSA may also apply teclmical analysis concerning the facility from which it intends to\nacquire foreign intelligence information to assist it in making determinations concerning the\nlocation of the person at whom NSA intends to direct surveillance. For example, NSA may\nexamine the following types of information:\n\n(S) For telephone nnmbers:\n\na) identify the country code of the telephone number, and determine what it indicates\nabout the person?s location.\n\nb) Review commercially available and NSA telephone numbering databases for\nindications of the type of telephone being used g. landline, wireless mobile,\nsatellite, etc), information that may provide an understanding of the location of the\ntarget.\n\n(S) For electronic communications \n\nReview NBA content repositories and internet communications data repositories (which\ncontain, among other things, lnternet conununications metadata) for previous Internet\nactivity. This information may contain network layer g, Internet Protocol addresses)\nor machine identi?er (cg, Media Access Control addresses) information, which NSA\ncompares to information contained in communication network databases and\ncommercially available Internet Protocol address registration information in order to\ndetermine the location of the target.\n\n(S) Assessment of the NonPUitited States Person Status of the Target\n\n(S) ln many cases, the infonnation that NSA examines in order to determine Whether a target is\nreasonably believed to be located outside the United States may also bear upon the non?United\nStates person status of that target. For example, lead information provided by an intelligence or\nlaw enforcement service of a foreign government may indicate not only that the target is located\nin a foreign country, but that the target is a citizen of that or another foreign country. Similarly,\ninformation contained in NBA databases, including repositories of information. collected by NSA\nand by other intelligence agencies, may indicate that the target is a non-United States person.\n\n(S) Furthermore, in order to prevent the inadvertent targeting of a United States person, NSA\nmaintains records of telephone numbers and electronic cormnunications accounts/addresses/\nidenti?ers that NSA has reason. to believe are being used by United States persons. Prior to\ntargeting, a particular telephone number or electronic account! address/identi?er\nwill be compared against those records in order to ascertain Whether NSA has reason to believe\nthat telephone number or electronic communications account/address/identi?er is being used by\na United States person.\n\nTOP \n3\n\nTOP \n\n(S) in the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person, a\nperson reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or Whose location is not\nknown will. be presumed to be a non?United States person unless such person can be positively\nidenti?ed as a United States person, or the nature or circumstances of the person's\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States person.\n\n(8) Assessment of the Foreign intelligence Purpose of the Targeting\n\n(S) In assessing Whether the target possesses and/or is likely to conununicate foreign\nintelligence information concerning a foreign power or foreign territory, NSA considers, among\nother things, the following factors:\n\na. With respect to telephone communications:\n\na information indicates that the telephone number has been used to \ndirectly With another telephone number reasonably believed by the US. Intelligence\nCommunity to be used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory;\n\n9 Information indicates that a user of the telephone number has conununioated directly\nwith an individual reasonably believed by the U.S. intelligence Community to be\nassociated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\nInformation indicates that the telephone number is listed in the telephone directory of\na telephone used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\na Information indicates that the telephone number has been transmitted during a\ntelephone call or other communication with an individual reasonably believed by the\n13.8. intelligence Community to be associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory;\n\na Publicly available sources of information telephone listings) match the\ntelephone number to an individual reasonably believed by the US. Intelligence\nCommunity to be associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\na Information contained in various NSA?maintained knowledge databases containing\nforeign intelligence niformation acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic\nsurveillance, physical search, or the use of a pen register and trap or trace device, or\nother information, reveals that the telephone number has been previously used by an\nindividual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory; or\n\n \n\n1 The NSA knowledge databases that would be used to satisfy this factor contain ?rsed intelligence\ninformation concerning international terrorism culled from signals intelligence, human intelligence, law enforcement\ninformation, and other sources. The information compiled in these databases is information that assists the signals\nintelligence system in effecting collection on intelligence targets. For example, a report produced by the CIA may\ninclude the fact that a known terrorist is using a telephone with a particular number. NSA would include that\ninformation in its knowledge databases.\n\nTOP \n4\n\nTOP \n\nInformation made available to NSA as a result of processing telephony\nmetadata records acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic surveillance,\nphysical search, or the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, or other\ninformation, reveals that the telephone number is used by an individual associated\nwith a foreign power or foreign territory.\n\nWith respect to Internet communications:\n\n0\n\nInformation indicates that the electronic communications account/address/identi?er\nhas been used to communicate directly with an electronic \naccount/address/identitier reasonably believed by the US. Intelligence Community to\nbe used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\nInformation indicates that a user of the electronic communications account/address/\nidenti?er has directly with an individual reasonably believed to be\nassociated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\nInformation indicates that the electronic communications account/address/identi?er is\nincluded in the ?buddy list? or address book of an electronic communications\naccount/address/identifier reasonably believed by the US. Intelligence Community to\nbe used by an. individual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\nInformation indicates that the electronic communications account/address/identi?er\nhas been transmitted during a telephone call or other conmtunication with an\nindividual reasonably believed. by the US. Intelligence Community to be associated\nwith a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\nPublic Internet postings match the electronic communications account/address/\nidentifier to an individual reasonably believed by the US. intelligence Community to\nbe associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n\nInformation contained in various NSA?maintained knowledge databases of foreign\nintelligence information acquired by any law?ll means, such as electronic\nsurveillance, physical search, the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, or\nother information, reveals that electronic communications account/address/identifier\nhas been previously used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory;\n\nbiformati on made available to NSA as a result of processing metadata\nrecords acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic surveillance, physical\nsearch, or the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, or other information,\nreveals that the electronic communications account/eddiess/identifier is used by an\nindividual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory; or\n\nbifonnation indicates that Internet Protocol ranges and/or specific electronic\nidentifiers or signatures (cg, specific types of or steganography) are used\nalmost exclusively by individuals associated with a foreign power or foreign territory,\n\nTOP \n5\n\nTOP \n\nor are extensively used by individuals associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory.\n\nH. (S) ANALYSIS BY NSA\n\nAfter a person has been targeted for acquisition by NSA, NSA will conduct post?\ntargeting analysis. Such. analysis is designed to detect those occasions when a person who when\ntargeted was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States has since entered the\nUnited States, and will enable NSA to take steps to prevent the intentional acquisition of any\ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of\nacquisition to be located in the United States, or the intentional targeting of a person Who is\ninside the United States. Such analysis may include:\n\nFor telephone numbers:\n\n8\n\nRoutinely comparing telephone numbers tasked pursuant to these procedures against\ninformation that has been incidentally collected from the Global System for Mobiles\n(GSM) Home Location Registers (HLR). These registers receive updates whenever a\nGSM phone moves into a new service area. Analysis of this HLR information provides a\nprimary indicator of a foreign user of a mobile telephone entering the United States.\n\nNSA may analyze content for indications that a foreign target has entered or\nintends to enter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to\nanalytic and intelligence requirements and priorities. \n\nFor electronic communications accounts/eddiesses/identi?ers:\n\n\n\nRoutinely checking all electronic communications accounts/addresses/identi?ers tasked\npursuant to these procedures against available databases that contain internet\ncommunications data (including metadata) to determine if an electronic communications\naccount/eddiess/identifier was accessed from overseas. Such databases contain\ncontact information and summaries of communications activity from\nNSA signals intelligence collection. The foreign access determination is made based on\ncomparing the Internet Protocol address associated with the account activity to other\ninformation NSA possesses about geographical area(s) serviced by particular Internet\nProtocol addresses. If the 1P address associated with the target activity is identified as a\nU.S.?based network gateway a Hotmail server) or a private Internet Protocol\naddress, then NSA will be required to perform additional research to determine if\nthe access was in a foreign country using additional criteria such as machine identi?er or\ncase notation (NSA circuit identi?er) of a communications link known to be foreign.\nSuch databases nonnally maintain information about such activity for a 12~month pen'od.\nThis data will be used in an attempt to rule out false positives from U.S.-based network\ngateways. If the account access is determined to be from a U.S.~based machine, further\nanalytic checks will be performed using content collection to determine if the target has\nmoved, into the United States.\n\n\n6\n\n08\n\nRoutinely comparing electronic communications accounts/addresees/identifiers tasked\npursuant to these procedures against a list of electronic communications accounts/\naddresses/identifiers already identi?ed by NSA as being accessed from inside the United\nStates. This will help ensure that no target has been recognized to be located in the\nUnited States.\n\nas NSA may analyze content for indications that a target has entered or intends to\nenter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic\nand intelligence requirements and priorities.\n\n(S) determines that a target has entered the United States, it will follow the procedures\nset forth in section IV of this document, including the termination of the acquisition from the\ntarget without delay. in cases Where NSA cannot resolve an apparent con?ict between\ninfonnation indicating that the target has entered the United States and information indicating\nthat the target remains located. outside the United States, NSA will presume that the target has\nentered the United States and ?will terminate the acquisition from that target. If at a later time\nNSA determines that the target is in fact located outside the United States, NSA may re?initiate\nthe acquisition in accordance with these procedures.\n\n(S) if NSA determines that a target who at the time of targeting was believed to be a neiinUnited\nStates person was in fact a United States person, it will follow the procedures set forth in section\nIV of this document, including the termination of the acquisition from the target without delay.\n\nHI. (U) \n\n(S) who request tasking will document in the tasking database a citation or citations to\nthe information that led them to reasonably believe that a targeted person is located outside the\nUnited States. Before tasking is approved, the database entry for that tasking will be reviewed in\norder to verify that the database entry contains the necessary citations.\n\n(S) A citation is a reference that identi?es the source of the information, such as a report number\nor communications intercept identi?er, which NSA will maintain. The citation will enable those\nresponsible for conducting oversight to locate and review the information that led NSA \nto conclude that a target is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\n\n(S) also will identify the foreign power or foreign territory about which they expect to\nobtain foreign intelligence information pursuant to the proposed targeting.\n\n1V. (U) OVERSIGHT AND \n\n(S) Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) Oversight and Compliance, with NSA's Of?ce\nof General Counsel (OGC), will develop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures\nto ensure intelligence personnel responsible for approving the targeting of persons under these\nprocedures, as well as with access to the acquired foreign intelligence information\nunderstand their responsibilities and the procedures that apply to this acquisition. SID Oversight\nand Compliance has established processes for ensuring that raw traf?c is labeled and stored only\nin authorized repositories, and is accessible only to those who have had the proper training. SID\n\nTOP \n7\n\n\n\nOversight and Compliance will conduct ongoing oversight activities and will make any\nnecessary reports, including those relating to incidents of noncompliance, to the NSA Inspector\nGeneral and OGC, in accordance with its NSA charter. SID Oversight and Compliance will also\nensure that necessary corrective actions are taken to address any identi?ed de?ciencies. To that\nend, SID Oversight and Compliance will conduct periodic spot checks of targeting decisions and\nintelligence disseminations to ensure compliance with established procedures, and. conduct\nperiodic spot checks of queries in data repositories.\n\n(S) The Department of Justice (D01) and the Of?ce of the Director of National Intelligence\n(ODNI) will conduct oversight of NSA's exercise of the authority under section. 702 of the Act,\nwhich will include periodic reviews by and ODNI personnel to evaluate the implementation\nof the procedures. Such reviews will occur at least once every sixty days.\n\n(S) NSA will report to DOJ, to the ODNI Of?ce of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil\nLiberties Protection Of?cer any incidents of noncompliance with these procedures by NSA\npersonnel that result in the intentional targeting of a person reasonably believed to be located in\nthe United States, the intentional targeting of a United States person, or the intentional\nacquisition of any communication in which the sender and all intended recipients are known at\nthe time of acquisition to be located within the United States. NSA will provide such reports\nWithin five business days of learning of the incident. Any information acquired. by intentionally\ntargeting a United States person or a person not reasonably believed to be outside the United\nStates at the time of such targeting will be purged from NSA databases.\n\n(S) NSA will report to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National\nSecurity Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and oversight, to the ODNI\nOf?ce of General Counsel, and to the Civil Liberties Protection Of? cer, any incidents of\nnoncompliance (including overcollection) by any electronic service provider to\nwhom the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence issued a directive under\nsection 702. Such report will be made within ?ve business days after determining that the\nelectronic service provider has not complied or does not intend to comply with a\ndirective.\n\n(S) In the event that NSA concludes that a person is reasonably believed to be located outside the\nUnited States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside the United States, or\nif NSA concludes that a person who at the time of targeting was believed to be a non-United\nStates person was in fact a United States person, it will take the following steps:\n\n1) Terminate the acquisition Without delay and. determine whether to seek a Court order\nunder another section of the Act. If NSA inadvertently acquires a communication\nsent to or from the target While the target is or was located inside the United States,\nincluding any communication where the sender and all intended recipients are\nreasonably believed to be located inside the United States at the time of acquisition,\nsuch communication will be treated in accordance with the applicable minimization\nprocedures.\n\nTOP \n8\n\nTOP \n\n2) Report the incident to 1303' through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the\nNational Security Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and\noversight, to the ODNI Of?ce of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties\nProtection Of?cer within ?ve business days.\n\nV. (U) DEPARTURE FRGM PRGCEDURES\n\n(S) If, in order to protect against an immediate threat to the national security, NSA determines\nthat it must take action, on a temporary basis, in apparent departure from these procedures and\nthat it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures from the Attorney\nGeneral and Director of National Intelligence, NSA may take such action and will report that\nactivity to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National Security\nDivision with responsibility for intelligence operations and, oversight, to the ODNI Of?ce of\nGeneral Counsel, and to the ODNI.

Purpose and Scope (U)\n\nThe United States has an abiding interest in developing and\nmaintaining use of cyberspace as an integral part of U.S.\nnational capabilities to collect intelligence and to deter,\ndeny, or defeat any adversary that seeks to harm U.S. national\ninterests in peace, crisis, or war. Given the evolution in U.S.\nexperience, policy, capabilities, and understanding of the cyber\nthreat, and in information and communications technology, this\ndirective establishes updated principles and processes as part\nof an overarching national cyber policy framework. \nThe United States Government shall conduct all cyber\noperations consistent with the U.S. Constitution and other\napplicable laws and policies of the United States, including\nPresidential orders and directives. \nThe United States Government shall conduct DCEO and OCEO under\nthis directive consistent with its obligations under\ninternational law, including with regard to matters of\nsovereignty and neutrality, and, as applicable, the law of\narmed conflict. \n\nThis directive pertains to cyber operations, including those\nthat support or enable kinetic, information, or other types of\noperations. Most of this directive is directed exclusively to\nDCEO and OCEO. \nThe United States Government has mature capabilities and\neffective processes for cyber collection. \nTherefore, this directive affirms and does not intend to alter\nexisting procedures, guidelines, or authorities for cyber\ncollection. \nThis directive provides a procedure for cyber collection\noperations that are reasonably likely to result in\n?significant consequences.?2 \n\nThe principles and requirements in this directive apply except\nas otherwise lawfully directed by the President. With the\nexception of the grant of authority to the Secretary of Defense\nto conduct Emergency Cyber Actions as provided below, nothing in\nthis directive is intended to alter the existing authorities of,\nor grant new authorities to, any United States Government\ndepartment or agency (including authorities to carry out\n\n \n\n2 referred to operations with significant consequences as ?sensitive\noffensive cyber operations.? \n\nTOP \n\nTOP 5\n\n \n\noperational activities), or supersede any existing coordination\nand approval processes, other than those of Nothing in\nthis directive is intended to limit or impair military\ncommanders from using DCEO or OCEO specified in a military\naction approved by the President and previously coordinated and\ndeconflicted as required by existing processes and this\ndirective. \n\nIn addition, this directive does not pertain to or alter\nexisting authorities related to the following categories of\nactivities by or on behalf of the United States Government,\nregardless of whether they produce cyber effects:\nActivities conducted under section 503 of the National\nSecurity Act of l947 (as amended);\nActivities conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act, the approval authority delegated to the\nAttorney General (AG) by section 2;5 of Executive Order 12333\n(as amended), or law enforcement authorities; however, cyber\noperations reasonably likely to result in significant\nconsequences still require Presidential approval, and\noperations that reasonably can be expected to adversely affect\nother United States Government operations still require\ncoordination under established processes;\nActivities conducted by the United States Secret Service for\nthe purpose of protecting the President, the Vice President,\nand others as defined in l8 U.S.C. 3056; however, cyber\noperations reasonably likely to result in significant\nconsequences still require Presidential approval, and\noperations that reasonably can be expected to adversely affect\nother United States Government operations still require\ncoordination under established processes;\nThe use of online personas and other virtual operations3 \nundertaken exclusively for counterintelligence, intelligence\ncollection, or law enforcement purposes that do not involve\nthe use of QCEO or \nActivities conducted in cyberspace pursuant to\ncounterintelligence authorities for the purpose of protecting\nspecific intelligence sources, methods, and activities;\nSignals intelligence collection other than cyber collection as\ndefined in this directive;\n\nOpenmsource intelligence collection;\nNetwork defense;\n\n \n\n3 Human intelligence operations undertaken via the Internet. \n\nTOP \n\n \n\nTOP 6\n\n \n\nTraditional electronic warfare4 activities;\n\nThe development of content to support influence campaigns,\nmilitary deception, or military information support\noperations; or\n\nSimple transit of data or commands through networks that do\nnot create cyber effects on those networks. \n\nGuiding Principles for DCEO and OCEO (U)\n\nDCEO and OCEO may raise unique national security and foreign\npolicy concerns that require additional coordination and policy\nconsiderations because cyberspace is globally connected. DCEO\nand UCEO, even for subtle or clandestine operations, may\ngenerate cyber effects in locations other than the intended\ntarget, with potential unintended or collateral consequences\nthat may affect U.S. national interests in many locations.\n\n\nThe United States Government shall conduct DCEO and OCEO in a\n\nmanner consistent with applicable values, principles, and norms\n\nfor state behavior that the United States Government promotes\n\ndomestically and internationally as described in the\n\n2011 ?International Strategy for Cyberspace.? \nNational-level strategic objectives and operational\nnecessities shall dictate what the United States Government\nseeks to accomplish with DCEO and OCEO. \nThe United States Government shall integrate UCEO and OCEO, as\nappropriate, with other diplomatic, informational, military,\neconomic, financial, intelligence, counterintelligence, and\nlaw enforcement options, taking into account effectiveness,\ncosts, risks, potential consequences, foreign policy, and\nother policy considerations. \nThe United States Government shall reserve the right to act in\naccordance with the United States? inherent right of self\ndefense as recognized in international law, including through\nthe conduct of DCEO. \nThe United States Government shall conduct neither DCEO nor\nOCEO that are intended or likely to produce cyber effects\nwithin the United States unless approved by the President. A\ndepartment or agency, however, with appropriate authority may\n\n \n\n4 As defined by the Joint Dictionary l~02, ?Department of Defense Dictionary\n\nof Military and Associated Terms? (as amended through February 15, 2012):\nmilitary action involving the use of electromagnetic or directed energy to\ncontrol the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.

These operations\n\nshall conform to the following additional policy principles:\nThe United States Government shall reserve use of DCEO to\nprotect U.S. national interests in circumstances when network\ndefense or law enforcement measures are insufficient or cannot\nbe put in place in time to mitigate a threat, and when other\npreviously approved measures would not be more appropriate, or\nif a Deputies or Principals Committee review determines that\nproposed DCEO provides an advantageous degree of\neffectiveness, timeliness, or efficiency compared to other\nmethods commensurate with the risks;\nThe United States Government shall conduct DCEO with the least\nintrusive methods feasible to mitigate a threat;\nThe United States Government shall seek partnerships with\nindustry, other levels of government as appropriate, and other\nnations and organizations to promote cooperative defensive\ncapabilities, including, as appropriate, through the use of\nDCEO as governed by the provisions in this directive; and\nPartnerships with industry and other levels of government for\nthe protection of critical infrastructure shall be coordinated\nwith the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), working with\nrelevant sector~specific agencies and, as appropriate, the\nDepartment of Commerce (DOC). \n\n \n\nThe United States recognizes that network defense, design, and\nmanagement cannot mitigate all possible malicious cyber activity\nand reserves the right, consistent with applicable law, to\nprotect itself from malicious cyber activity that threatens 0.8.\nnational interests. \n\nThe United States Government shall work with private industry\nthrough DHS, DOC, and relevant sector?specific agencies to\nprotect critical infrastructure in a manner that minimizes the\nneed for DCEO against malicious cyber activity; however, the\nUnited States Government shall retain DCEO, including\nanticipatory action taken against imminent threats, as\ngoverned by the provisions in this directive, as an option to\nprotect such infrastructure. \n\nThe United States Government shall - in coordination, as\nappropriate, with DHS, law enforcement, and other relevant\ndepartments and agencies, to include sectorwspecific agencies\nobtain the consent of network or computer owners for\n\nUnited States Government use of DCEO to protect against\nmalicious cyber activity on their behalf, unless the activity\n\nTOP \n\n \n\nTOP 9\n\n \n\nimplicates the United States? inherent right of selfwdefense\nas recognized in international law or the policy review\nprocesses established in this directive and appropriate legal\nreviews determine that such consent is not required. \n\nOffensive Cyber Effects Operations (U)\n\nOCEO can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance\nU.S. national objectives around the world with little or no\nwarning to the adversary or target and with potential effects\nranging from subtle to severely damaging. The development and\nsustainment of OCEO capabilities, however, may require\nconsiderable time and effort if access and tools for a specific\ntarget do not already exist. \n\nThe United States Government shall identify potential targets\nof national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable\nbalance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other\ninstruments of national power, establish and maintain OCEO\ncapabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S.\noffensive capabilities, and execute those capabilities in a\nmanner consistent with the provisions of this directive.\n\n\nIV. Cyber Operations with Significant Consequences (U)\n\nSpecific Presidential approval is required for any cyber\noperations including cyber collection, DCEO, and OCEO \ndetermined by the head of a department or agency to conduct the\noperation to be reasonably likely to result in ?significant\nconsequences? as defined in this directive. This requirement\napplies to cyber operations generally, except for those already\napproved by the President, even if this directive otherwise does\nnot pertain to such operations as provided in the ?Purpose and\nScope? section of this directive. \n\nV. Threat Response Operations (U)\n\nResponses to Persistent Malicious Cyber Activity (U)\nDepartments and agencies with appropriate authorities \nconsistent with the provisions set forth in this directive and\nin coordination with the Departments of State, Defense (DOD),\nJustice (DOJ), and Homeland Security; the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence the National Security Agency the\nCentral Intelligence Agency the Departments of the\nTreasury and Energy and other relevant members of the\nIntelligence Community (IC) and sector?specific agencies shall\nestablish criteria and procedures to be approved by the\n\n \n\nTOP \n\nTOP lO\n\n \n\nPresident for responding to persistent malicious cyber activity\nagainst U.S. national interests.
