I

(TS//SI/REL) This technique supports the HP Proliant 380DL G5 server, onto which
a hardware implant has been installed that communicates over the l2C Interface
(WAGONBED).

(TS//SI//REL) Through interdiction, IRONCHEF, a software CNE implant and the
hardware implant are installed onto the system. If the software CNE implant is
removed from the target machine, IRONCHEF is used to access the machine,
determine the reason for removal of the software, and then reinstall the software
from a listening post to the target system.
