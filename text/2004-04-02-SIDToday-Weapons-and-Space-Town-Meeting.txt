The meeting followed a<br>similar town meeting held earlier in the month for the Denver Security Operations Center<br>(DSOC) workforce. The gathering focused on the ongoing process of transferring the<br>TechSIGINT "center of gravity" from Ft Meade to Denver.<br>(S//SI) Generals Quirk and Armor described the strategy behind the move (see the article "<br>Status of the DSOC " for details), and also addressed some of the logistical and administrative<br>issues of interest to the workforce. Members of the Denver Integrated Product Team (IPT),<br>tasked with ensuring a smooth transition of the mission to Denver, also provided an update on<br>the many agreements, concept of operations, schedules, etc. currently being finalized. According<br>to IPT member Morrie Levine, all of the major documentation will be completed by April 5th for<br>presentation to Congress.<br>(S//SI) The presenters noted that although most of the TechSIGINT workforce will transition to<br>Denver in the coming years, a sizable presence (such as DEFSMAC and those working budgetary<br>matters, for example) will remain at Ft Meade. MG Quirk encouraged the workforce to challenge<br>their management to resolve any issues as they arise.
