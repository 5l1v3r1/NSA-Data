What if you were able to save<br>lives, too? If so, read what Arabic linguist Vicky had to say about her experience in the<br>Counterterrorism Product Line (CT):<br>(S//SI) Vicky is a native Arabic linguist who came to the United States from Jerusalem. After<br>completing her university degree at the University of Maryland, Vicky worked in marketing for a<br>while and then decided to stay home to care for her children. She did not intend to re-enter the<br>workforce until her children were older, but the events of September 11, 2001 changed her<br>plans.<br>(S//SI) With a strong desire to give back to the country that had given her so many<br>opportunities and to support the war on terror, she applied to both the FBI and NSA, was hired<br>by FBI first, and then transferred to NSA in July 2003. As a participant in NSA's Language<br>Analysis New Hire Development Program, Vicky was first assigned to S2I22, the Lebanese<br>Hizballah branch in the CT Product Line. Vicky is fluent in the Levantine and Egyptian dialects,<br>and also understands the Saudi and Iraqi dialects.<br>(TS//SI) As a voice language analyst in S2I22, Vicky produces transcripts of conversations<br>between Imad Mughniyah, notorious leader of the Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO), the terrorist<br>wing of Lebanese Hizballah, and his inner circle. Her work on IJO's Unit 1800 has contributed to<br>the successful disruption of terrorist operations in Israel. She has received outstanding feedback<br>from customers, and has the immense satisfaction of knowing that her work has saved lives.<br>(TS//SI) In addition to her regular duties, Vicky performs quality control of transcripts and<br>serves as a mentor to junior linguists in her branch, which she enjoys tremendously. She is very<br>impressed with the caliber of the linguists she works with and with their dedication to the<br>mission. She enjoys her work in CT so much that she asked for a six-month extension of her<br>current assignment. After that, she will rotate to an office in the MENA Product Line to obtain<br>experience working Middle Eastern diplomatic and intelligence targets. Vicky plans to return to<br>CT after completing the development program, since serving her country by supporting the<br>Global War on Terrorism is the reason she re-entered the workforce. Vicky finds her work in CT<br>to be extremely rewarding--she sees the effects of her contributions on a daily basis and knows<br>she is making a positive difference in the world.<br>(U//FOUO) If Vicky's experience appeals to you, come to the CT Job Fair on 30 June in 2B6008<br>from 1000 to 1500 to find out more about job opportunities in the CT Product Line.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p></p>
