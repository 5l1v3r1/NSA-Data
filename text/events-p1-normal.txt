Event (SIGINT)

An Event within a SIGINT context refers to a phenomenon, something observable at a given time.
Typically, an event results from a direct observation of an electronic communication of some form but it
could also result from other sources.

Events contain only metadata and do not contain message content. Sometimes there are grey areas
between events and content. For example the subject of an e-mail is generally transmitted in the header
portion of the message that contains the Events metadata. However the subject can be considered Content
because it reveals information about the purpose of the message (as is the current interpretation).

There are generally fewer legal restrictions about the collection and processing of events than content
items. This is one enabler of events bulk collection and retention, which is not generally possible with
content.

feditl Event Granularity

More than one definition of an event is in use. In HAUSTORIUM (Now Decommissioned and replaced
with SOCIAL ANTHROPOID) an event normally has the granularity of a single message. The
observation of an e-mail constitutes a single event, even though the e-mail may be addressed to many
people. Other projects may define an event in a slightly different way. For example several distinct
