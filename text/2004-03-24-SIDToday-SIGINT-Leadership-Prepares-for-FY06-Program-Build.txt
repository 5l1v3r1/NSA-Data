DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) SIGINT Leadership Prepares for FY06 Program Build<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications (S02C)<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 03/24/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications (S02C) <br>Unknown <br>(U) Each year around this time the SIGINT Leadership and the organizations directly involved in<br>the preparation of it begin the long, hard road to the next Program Build. Most of us are not<br>really affected by this process even though we are all affected by the outcome. The FY05<br>program build recently reached the stage of delivering the CBJB to Congress.<br>(U) In preparation for the FY06 Program Build activities, the SIGINT Leadership commissioned a<br>study to help them make the best decisions.<br>(U) The study, delivered at the 24 Feb 04 SIGINT leadership offsite, is intended to provide<br>relevant background information needed for the leadership to provide guidance for the program<br>builders.<br>(U//FOUO) The driving element of the study is that the SIGINT Enterprise needs to understand<br>the forces shaping the SIGINT environment from outside the organization, including views from<br>customers, guidance, technology developments, and the geopolitical outlook for the near future.<br>In order to provide this, S01X, with Toffler Associates, took relevant data from internal NSA and<br>Intelligence Community sources such as the recent Target Technology Trends Center report ,<br>the SINIO Geopolitical Forecast , and DOD/IC and Agency guidance. Additional outside<br>information came from reviewing "real world" cases of knowledge-based organizations facing<br>challenges similar to those faced by the SIGINT Enterprise. These cases were from commercial,<br>civil government and military sectors.<br>(U//FOUO) The presentation shows that the SIGINT Enterprise -- like other knowledge<br>organizations -- is in a constant cycle of adaptation driven by customer demands and changes in<br>the external operating environment. Organizations in this cycle must make big bets on the<br>future or risk becoming a fixed strategic target. For us this means a greater and greater<br>emphasis on adapting to new operating requirements and greater sharing of information with<br>partners and customers.<br>(U) After reading this presentation, what do you think should be stressed in NSA's efforts in<br>FY06?<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
