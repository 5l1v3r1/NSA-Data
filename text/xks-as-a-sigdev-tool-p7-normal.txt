XKS Storage Times

Front end storage is limited bv
and policy restrictions and will

resources
vary by site

At some sites, the amount of data we
receive per day (20+ Terabytes) can only
be stored for as little as 24 hours based
on available resources

Other sites have legal or policy
restrictions that limit the amount of time
we can store data (if we can at all)

It's a rolling buffer where new data comes
in and pushes the oldest data out
