Abstract

(TS//SI//REL) The goal of forward-based defense is to detect and mitigate malicious
threats in real-time, as close to the source as possible. It is part of a layered defense
strategy with four concentric zones: endpoint-, perimeter-, aggregation-, and forward-
based defenses. The QUANTUMTHEORY mission leverages NSA's vast system of
distributed passive sensors to detect target traffic and tip a centralized
command/control node. This node assesses the tip and injects a response towards the
target using active TAO assets.

(TS//SI//REL) Extremely powerful CNE/CND/CNA network effects are enabled by
integrating our passive and active systems:
resetting connections
redirecting targets for exploitation
* taking control of IRC bots
" corrupting file uploads/downloads
= More'.

(TS//SI//REL) The success rate of these effects is largely determined by the latency
from tip-to-target. OFIRE is a consolidated QUANTUMTHEORY platform under
development that reduces latencies by co-locating (1) existing passive sensors with (2)
local decision resolution, and (3) the ability to locally inject traffic to achieve the
desired network effect.
