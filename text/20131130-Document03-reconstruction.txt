Organization of C'vber in the Netherlands (U)

(S SI REL TO USA, XLD) Tlie meeting began with a briefing from the Dutch about
their reorganization and the creation of the new SIGINT and Cyber Division and Single
Point of Contact (SPoC). |HHriote^ that Project^|^^Hto create this new division
appears to be on track, with MIVD and AIVD technical specialists starting to be pulled
out of their original locations to join the new division, located at AIVD HQ in
Zoetenneer. This new division will be headed by a steering committee comprised of
MIVD Director Pieter Bindt and AIVD Director Rob Berthoiee. Under them will be the
SPoC. headed by	as a sidenote. plans are underway for^^l to visit

MS A at the end of May . Slide 7 includes a couple of abbreviations: AS - MLVD's
SIGINT Division, SOM — AIVD s Special Investigating Committee, QMO — the support
organization. The SPoC technical specialists will work closely with the analysts
(including	branch ¡, who will remain in AIVD outside the new entity XLXCSA

(the Dutch equivalent of IAD)will probably also be pulled into the new entity.

(S SI REL TO USA, XLD) Tire Dutch created the National Cyber Security Center
(NCSC)in Jan 2012 to cover general (not military) cyber issues, and this center is still
dealing with growing pains It is having difficulty filling all its vacancies, it still lacks a
legal framework, and private companies fight any public notification that cyber attacks
have taken place When asked where to turn forhelp in the case of an intrusion on a
commercial entity, the answer was that it depends—if the help needed is technical, then
AIVD; otherwise, NCSC, averred that AIVD has good relations with companies.
Hie national police (KLPD) has a liaison with NCSC also.

(S SI REL TO USA, NLD) The National Detection Network (NDN) governs Dutch
sensors. This network is DEVELOPING—some sensors are public and some are private,

some entities have their own

(S.VSI ' RELTO USA, NLD) Some other notes:

•	The Dutch do not have red or blue teaming yet

•	AIVD is concerned with espionage, not crime

•	Tiie Dutch are working toward having only one IP point «‘here all government
agencies touch the internet, because this will be easier to monitor defend

•	SO percent of NSA tools used to find malware are commercial, while 100 percent
of Dutch tools are

•	In the cyber realm, there is no ONE government agency in charge yet, but iE will
eventually be the NCSC

•	There is still no cable access yet, but the laws may be changed in the next year or
two. However, Dutch lawyers believe that they can tap it now if it is for
DEFENSIVE measures only

Webfora and the Onion Router (TOR) (U)

(S SI REL TO USA, NLD) The web forum discussion was of greater interest Hie

Dutch provided an overview of their data presentation tool (at a very high level). They

data with other social network info, and trying to figure out good ways to mine the data
that thevhave.

mJ

(S.VSLREL TO USA, NLD) Questions the Dutch had were based on our analytic
tradecraft noted that we use keywords to some extent, and outlined the division of
effort between|^^^^^and sustained targeting. If that partner engagement is of interest
(from|^^| perspective, it is in that we want to track their activities on ^^^and
maximize their exploitation of that data),^^Jsuspects we can focus oil tradecraft and
general an alytic philosophy and build quite a bit of credibility that way.

(S. VSL REL TO USA, NLD)^^Mgave a brief update on our efforts with Tor, noting that
the multi-national effort seemed the best avenue for a sustained capability at present and
we me actively working our legal processes to make progress.
