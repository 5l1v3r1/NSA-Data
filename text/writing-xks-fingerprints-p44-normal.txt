Context Sensitive Scanning

• X-KEYSCORE’s context sensitive scanning engine
allows you to explicitly say where you want a term to
hit.

As an early example, the Tech Strings in Documents
capability allowed analysts to restrict terms to only
Email, Chat or Documents Bodies

The full XKS Context Sensitive Scanning engine
allows for over 70 unique contexts to be used as part of
an fingerprint
