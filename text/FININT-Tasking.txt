[edit] GCHQ’s FINANCIAL DATA

A check of GCHQ's and NSA's financial datasets should always be considered, notjust when
your target is involved in finance or when you discover a bank account or credit card for them.

Financial data is 'just another data source' and Financial Intelligence or FININT could provide
new leads, selectors and geo-location on any target from a search of their name, address, phone
no (mob, landline, business), IMSI, email address, business name, as well as bank account or
credit/debit card number.

•	GCHQ retain bulk banking data from financial institutions in the Middle East, Pakistan,
Zimbabwe and Kenya, and bulk credit card transaction data.

•	Stored on AAS EXPERIMENT and a number of biographical FININT datasets are available to
query in LUCKY STRIKE.

•	Other FININT datasets that cannot for legal and policy reasons be made available in LUCKY
STRIKE will be included in a new Finance/Travel tool in development: Lucky escape
(restricted access).

•	Please contact	,	or	GCHQ Travel & Finance Data

Senior User for further details and/or to request access.

The details required for a FININT check are outlined in the FININT Tasking template, see also

FININT Legalities.

[edit] LUCKY STRIKE and LUCKY ESCAPE

• LUCKY STRIKE

CT FININT are working with the Finance/Travel Senior User and OPPLEG to make bulk selectors
derived from financial datasets available via LUCKY STRIKE and access permitted to all LUCKY
STRI KE users. LUCKY STRI KE is an analyst tool which enables a target identifier to be searched
against many collateral datasets, with the aim of enriching the ’seed' selector and providing context
and additional information. LUCKY STRIKE currently holds over a billion records across 40+ unique
datasets, ranging from GSM subscriber details to FININT data.

•	Lucky escape

LUCKY ESCAPE enables analysts to quickly run unselected TDI's (e.g. MSISDN, email, passport)
against a multitude of travel and financial datasets, with a view to answering the simple questions 'has
my target travelled anywhere?', 'has my target a bank account, credit card and/or have they made any
financial transactions?'. The Senior User is	GCHQ Travel & Finance Data Senior

User ^^|. The datasets which sit behind LUCKY ESCAPE are linked together by field types. This
enables very powerful, and very fast, data fusion.

[edit] TRACFIN

•	It must be minimum UK/US Eyes
