[edit] (U) Invitation

(S//NF) The Information Operations Center's Engineering Development Group (EDG) would like to
announce the seventh Trusted Computing Jamboree. The Jamboree is organized and sponsored by the
Security Portfolio of EDG's Emerging Technologies Branch (ETB). As in past years, the Jamboree will be an
informal and interactive conference with an emphasis on presentations that provide important information
to developers trying to circumvent or exploit new security capabilities.

(U) The Jamboree will be held Tuesday-Thursday, February 7-9, 2012 at the Lockheed Martin Dulles
Executive Plaza II, 13560 Dulles Technology Drive, Herndon, VA 20171. Tuesday and Wednesday will run
from 9am to 5pm, Thursday will run from 9am to 12pm.

(S//NF) The TCB Program continues to explore architectures that will have a significant impact on future
Information Operations. Technologies such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) pose both threats and
opportunities for the Intelligence Community.

(S//NF) The main purpose of the Jamboree will be to discuss how the results of the Security Portfolio
research can be applied today. Rather than an overview of all the activities within the Program, we will
present notable results that will provide developers insight into how to meet the threats of the TCG
architectures and embedded architectures and how they can exploit new avenues of attack.
