DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Baghdad: Perceptions &amp; Fact (repost)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/16/2004<br><br>(S//REL) As noted in recent Agency-all emails, today will see the debut of the "Frankly<br>Speaking" program with General Hayden. One of his guests will be <br>, former<br>NSA/CSS Representative (NCR) Iraq. (See the Frankly Speaking announcement for details on<br>how to tune in to the program.) To mark the occasion, we are reposting a SID today article<br>featuring <br> observations on conditions in Baghdad:<br>(C) What do you picture when you hear the term "green zone" in reference to the area in<br>Baghdad where the Iraqi Provisional Government was headquartered and the US Embassy is<br>now? Chances are the picture is of extreme security, mortar and rocket craters, and everyone<br>running from place to place to keep from being shot. Well, according to<br> the<br>former and recently returned NCR, Baghdad, that isn't quite accurate.<br>(U) Sure, all the Americans are carrying weapons and wearing body armor. Of course, there are<br>fences, two perimeters just like here at NSA, but there are apartment buildings where Iraqis live<br>and restaurants, too. It isn't downtown Annapolis but it isn't the Wild West, either.<br>(U)<br> says that those traveling to Iraq generally have one of two perceptions. Either they<br>assume it will be just like any other TDY - land at the airport and catch a cab to the base. Or,<br>they imagine running between car and building, building and building in a crouched position like<br>the guys in the movie "Saving Private Ryan". In fact, it is really somewhere in between. It is<br>true that immediately upon leaving Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) one is under the<br>watchful eye of the US Military and an NSA provided Security Detail and that traveling in two<br>vehicle convoys is a requirement. But, more and more the atmosphere is getting to be like the<br>former vs. the latter.<br>(U) It is also true that rockets and mortars are fired at the green zone but these "attacks" are a<br>means of harassment, purely a terrorist's tactic. These haphazard "attacks" more often than<br>not, end up adding another pockmark to the faÃ§ade of the Sheraton Hotel, which is across the<br>Tigris River from the green zone.<br>(U) When asked how things changed while he was there (6 February - 1 June)<br> quickly said<br>that it was the conditions within the palace that housed the NCR and the Coalition Provisional<br>Authority that changed the most.<br>(U) In February, when <br> arrived, the place still looked like it was in a war zone. It was very<br>dirty. There were scads of quickly strung communications wires hanging from the ceiling,<br>everywhere. But, as the time for the State Department to take over came nearer the palace<br>began looking more like an embassy.<br> recalls seeing those large floor buffers, familiar to<br>most military people, being used on the marble floors to bring back the shine. Also, the closer<br>the date for the handover of power to the Iraqi Interim Government came the obvious presence<br>of the US Occupation forces lessened.<br>(U) Rubbing elbows with members of the foreign service with global reputations was amazing.<br>Mixing and cooperating with members of our sister intelligence agencies was another highlight.<br>But, by far the most fulfilling and gratifying experience for<br> was witnessing, first-hand, the<br>difference SIGINT makes on a daily basis in Iraq.<br> <br>Tank in Iraq named Cypher Text <br>(U) The photo is of<br><br>with a tank he happened upon. The custom is for the tank driver to<br><br> </p>name his tank and put that name on the barrel of the gun. This unknown tank driver may have<br>had a job here at one time!<br>(U) This article first appeared on July 27, 2004.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
