netstat will tell if...

•	sotf dist is listening for connections

•	If connections have been made to the sotf_dist

•	If we are “backing up”- i.e., if sotf_dist is running
but has no process_data’s connected to it, it won’t
be able to send data anywhere, so eventually its
network receive queue will get large.

► Ideally, the receive queue should always be 0.
