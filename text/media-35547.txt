is handling the task.

If the task is inappropriate for or is one that there will be no
resources available for in the foreseeable future then the TL changes the Task
Status to ?Rejected? and notifies the task originator explaining why the task has
been rejected. The task?s Record Status is then set to ?Arcbive?.

- Decide if the timescale is achievable given the available resources and
personnel

- Decide if the necessary resources are available

- If an appropriate person is available assign them

Ta. If resources are not currently available but the task is one that will
definitely complete some time in the near future when resources are available the

Date Search there are three sub categories ofthis search; ?No date search? [which
searches for record with no date set in the chosen ?eld}. Search for a single date?. or
Search over a date range?. These searches can be conducted on several ?elds;
Required by Date?. ?Date Submitted?. ?Date last updated? and ?Date Task Completed?.

This search is useful for finding all the tasks that need to be completed by a specific
date.

The search types can be used in concert e.g. tasks with SIC in the title with a

reg uired by date between Dll?ElEDll and DEllDlEDll. this is achieved by running
one search and then the other.
