(TS//SI//NF) On 5 Aug 2011, collection of DNR and DNI traffic at the
FAIRVIEW CLIFFSIDE trans-pacific cable site resumed, after being
down for approximately five months. Collection operations at
CLIFFSIDE had been down since 11 March 2011, due to the cable damage
as a result of the earthquake off of the coast of Japan. The initial
damage assessment showed the loss of collection of 275 El DNR
circuits and 55 DNI circuits. Since the cable was repaired and
returned to service (5 Aug), FAIRVIEW operations has tasked 205 El
DNR circuits and 37 DNI circuits for collection. Enviornmental
survey continues to compare the old enviornment footprint to the new
environment footprint and FAIRVIEW operations will continue to task
collection for all new and restored circuits.
