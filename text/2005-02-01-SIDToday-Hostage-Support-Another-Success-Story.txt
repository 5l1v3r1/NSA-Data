(U) Hostage Support -- Another Success Story

(S//SI) The November Foreign Affairs Digest ran an article entitled "Hostage Support," (see link
to article ) in which they recounted the fact that Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure
(DGSE), our French SIGINT partner, had sent a driver to the American embassy in Paris with an
extremely urgent message for DIRNSA just a few days after two French journalists were taken
hostage in Iraq. Our SIGINT Liaison Officer (SLO) in Paris received the message on DIRNSA's
behalf, and set things in motion - the French had requested NSA's help and support in
identifying and locating the kidnappers.

(S//SI) On December 23, SLO Paris sent the following note to her FAD chain of command. (Note

that the hostages had been released on December 21 and were back in France on December

22).

(S//SI) I made the mistake of stopping by the office today on my way to the gym at the
Embassy. As I entered my office to pick up my to wel, the phone ivas ringing off the hook. It ivas
Director General Brochand's office calling to say that an urgent message for General Hayden
from Mr. Brochand ivas being dispatched by motorcycle to me. I waited in my office (this being
France this meant a few hours!) and finally the motorcycle messenger from DGSE arrived.

(S//SI) Ab iv, DGSE co uld have faxed this note or sent it via the bilateral line, however, sending
such a message in this manner obviously has a much higher value from a diplomatic standpoint
and is considered by the French to be very important. (We Americans would consider this
wasting time.) So it ivas with great fanfare and importance that the following message was
received. I have faxed this letter to FAD for formal transmission to General Hayden.

Text of Letter:

Dear Michael,

After the release of our hostages in Iraq, I would like to express my gratitude to you personally
and to your collaborators for the assistance NS A provided to DGSE through the whole crisis. It
helped us to improved our understanding of the situation and make the right decision, in an
extremely difficult context. Thank you again and my best vrishes to you, your family, and your
staff on this Christmas' eve.

Yo urs sincerely, Pierre.
