No doubt you've seen<br>advertisements of MMS-capable phones, some of which are called camera phones.<br>(S//SI) Although hindered by interoperability issues, which are slowly dwindling, MMS-capable<br>networks and handsets are now available in many countries around the globe, with Africa and<br>the Middle East lagging behind. We know many of our targets possess phones capable of<br>sending and receiving MMS, and we've seen direct evidence of its use by specific targets. With<br>this in mind, the question arises: "Can we get SIGINT from it?" Unfortunately, the current<br>answer is, "Not yet;" however, steps are being taken to rectify this. These steps include the<br>development of:<br>an automated collection and processing capability for traffic from MMS-carrying networks<br>-- MMS requires more bandwidth than Second Generation (2G) cellular systems, such as<br>GSM. Currently, the predominant mobile network capable of carrying MMS is General<br>Packet Radio Service (GPRS), which is considered a 2.5 Generation (2.5G) network. S3 is<br>heading an effort to build an architecture to process GPRS data, and they are currently<br>preparing to test key processing threads.<br>an automated capability to extract and process MMS that is embedded in GPRS data -S3 is about 85% finished in developing this capability.<br>a database and interface for storage, retrieval and viewing of MMS -- for those familiar<br>with Short Messaging Service, this is analogous to building a DISHFIRE-like tool for MMS.<br>This will be challenging, because MMS utilizes many different formats for each media:<br>text, sound, picture and video. There is currently an A&amp;P Analytic Need to provide such a<br>tool, but development has not yet started.<br>(S//SI) As MMS is a relatively new technology, it is important to document which targets are<br>using MMS, and for what purposes. That information can then be used to determine the right<br>priority level for the development of capabilities to exploit MMS. If you are a SIGINT analyst, you<br>can help! If you suspect that your target uses MMS, please send any relevant information -including what the target is and how you suspect it is using MMS -- to <br> <br>@nsa.<br>(U//FOUO) An MMS solution is on the way, hopefully sooner rather than later.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
