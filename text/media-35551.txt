(U//FOUO) GNETWORK

(S//SI//REL) Tool u sed to extract and correlate
information from a variety of NAC, SSG, SSO, NTOC
and other metadata databases

(s//si//REL) Keep an Eye on the Entire
Netblock

^ (S//SI//REL) Multiple VPNs for one
target

^ different purposes
^ different clients

(s//si//rel) GNOME Task: Private
IP VPNs

^ (S//SI//REL) Find a public IP associated with
your private IP
^ Loopback IP
^ Another interface IP

^ (S//SI//REL) Use those for your GNOME report
and look for your private IP on the same link

^ (S//SI//REL) Data presented in the VPN tab in
GNOME report is limited

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL



(U//FOUO) Network
Patterns...

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

(s//si//rel) IP Patterns

^ (S//SI//REL) Admins are people -- lean towards
predictability in assignment of IPs to make
their job easier

^ (S//SI//REL) IP or a combination of the octets
could be an indication of:

^ network provider
^ location

^ specific purpose in the network

(§/7si//REL) Example #l:Private IP VPN

rt side of the VPN:

(s//si//rel) Client

•	Second octet indicated the network provider
^ 20 = network provider #l

^ 2l = network provider #2

•	Second and third octet = country

^ 20.30 and 21.30 were the same country but different providers
• 40 = individual target entity in that country

" (s//si//rel) Server side of the VPN:^^

• Second octet indicated network provider

^ 51= network provider #1
^ 52 = network provider #2

(s//si//rel) Example #2:Network

Patterns

(S//SI//REL) Public IP VPN:^^^^^|.#

^ Third octet = country location of this IP (three
possible)

^ Fourth octet= country location of the other side
of the VPN connection

Analyzed the opposite side of this /24
and identified the country for 167 4th
octet values (out of 209) „ when this
public IP connects to a private IP we
know the country location of the private

IP.

(U//FOUO) Final Thoughts...

*	(S//SI//REL) Just because you don't get results doesn't
mean the answer isn't there

*	If you're looking for a connection from A to B and don't
find it, then maybe you need to look for one from A to C
to B

*	(S//SI//REL) Try the query a different way

*	Widen the search either by wildcarding (if permitted) or
by selecting a different drop-down option

*	Enter information in a different field

(u//Fouo)Final Thoughts...

^ (S//SI//REL) All IPs are important until proven otherwise
^They all serve a purpose and belong to a device

^ Make note of what you find even if you don't know at the
time what it means

=> (S//SI//REL) Search for data even if results are unlikely
=> (S//SI//REL) Don't necessarily discard dated information

(u//fouo) Final Thoughts...

(U//FOUO) Understand the data that you are searching and
what the fields in the GUI are searching for

=> (U//FOUO) Take an iterative approach: start searches wide,
then narrow them down, then widen back out again

=> (S//SI//REL) Bounce between the different databases and use
the tools for every aspect of your network analysis

(s//si//rel) VPN SIGDEV:

Build the network knowledge...

(TS//SI//REL) Dig beyond paired collection,
PSKs and persistence

(S//SI//REL) Discovery of the inner IPs of the
VPN is possible in ways otherthan decryption

(S//SI//REL) Investigate device IPs

^ (U//FOUO) Look for patterns

(S//SI//REL) Discoverthe 'N' of yourVPN
