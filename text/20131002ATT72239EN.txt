Background

1.	EU data protection law1 has been established with the objective of protecting the
fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in particular their right to the
protection of personal data. Moreover the compliance with these rules is subject
to the control of public independent authorities.

2.	EU data protection law contains specific provisions relating international transfers
of personal data processed in the EU to third countries; their objective is to ensure
the continuity of the protection afforded by EU law where personal data are
transferred. In substance, transfers may take place where the third country offers
an adequate level of protection or when, in the absence of adequate level of
protection, the controller adduces appropriate safeguards with respect to the
protection of personal data (e.g.: contractual clauses, binding corporate rules).
Derogations to this rule may occur in specific cases laid down in EU data protection
law.

3.	The Commission has declared in 2000 that the Safe Harbour Principles issued by
the US Department of Commerce provide an adequate level of protection2.
Transfers to organisations not having self-certified adherence to Safe Harbour
principles will take place under other mechanisms such as contractual clauses of
binding corporate rules.

4.	This hearing focuses on the impact of electronic mass surveillance of EU citizens
on their fundamental right to the protection of personal data.

5.	Session I focuses on the impact of mass surveillance programmes on the rights of
EU citizens to data protection, either these programmes are implemented by third
countries or by EU Member States. The Commission will also inform on the
progress of its evaluation of the Safe Harbour.

6.	Sessions II and III are devoted to the assessment of the impact of US surveillance
programmes on existing tools for transfers of personal data to the US. While
Session II focuses on the US Safe Harbour, Session III focuses on the impact on
other instruments used by companies for their data flows. Statements of the EU
data protection authorities, the European Data Protection Supervisor and a
management services consultant entity in privacy and new technologies which has
issued reports on the implementation of the US Safe Harbour.

Particularly; Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation (EC) N° 45/2001.
