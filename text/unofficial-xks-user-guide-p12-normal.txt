3.	Looking for a phone number without the country code (non-normalized)? It’s
possible a target will pass their phone number without the country code (e.g. a
signature line with ‘Tel: 5354658”). In that case, XKEYSCORE will not find the
number with the country code so you must create a query that looks for fewer
digits but still complies with USSID-18. This is not a 100% solution* but
ANDing your query with a country or IP address would certainly be more
compliant. See example below:

The number you enter here isn’t
normalized beciiuse you expect to see
it in traffic without the country code.
To make this USSID-18 Compliant
you must AND this with something
like a country or IP address.

This example shows traffic in/out of
Pakistan

This example shows traffic
in/out of a particular
network/IP Address

•If you ask XKEYSCORE to give you all Pakistani traffic, it’s doing an NKB lookup on all Pakistani
registered IP addresses. Geolocation of IP addresses is not 100% accurate at this time. Unofficial estimates
say asking for all of Country X’s traffic will find between 50-60% of the actual traffic. (That’s more than
0%. though, right?)
