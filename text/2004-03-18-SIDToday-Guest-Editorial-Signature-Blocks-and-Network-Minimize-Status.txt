This is documented in CIO-025-2001 dated 12 June 2001 . At a<br>minimum, your signature block should contain your name and organization, with the<br>organization description being unclassified. Other locator and identification information is always<br>welcome. This is a convenience for the recipient if he/she needs to know a little more about you.<br>There are several examples in the referenced SPF.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are on an NT , you can set up a signature file to be automatically added to<br>your emails.<br>Click on help,<br>Click Microsoft Outlook Help,<br>Click Answer Wizard, then search on "signature"<br>Click on the first returned item "Create a signature for messages."<br>Step by step instructions will take you through the process.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are on a UNIX machine , see this webpage for instructions for setting up<br>your email signature block:<br>(U//FOUO) The CIO policy does not specify anything about graphics being included in your<br>signature block, but there is a network minimize in effect that restricts the sending of<br>attachments that are not absolutely necessary to the conduct of official Agency business.<br>Therefore, it just doesn't make sense to clog up the Agency communications systems with<br>graphic packages in your signature block, or even worse, extraneous attachments that serve no<br>operational purpose. Some emails have JPG and other attachments with pictures tagging along<br>that simply take up room in our cyberspace.<br>(U//FOUO) One such attachment that has been seen is about 5.5kb in size. This could easily add<br>72mb to the Agency infrastructure in a year with that file going to only one recipient of each<br>mail. Then multiply that by all the cc's on the mails, forwards, etc. and you're taking up one<br>heck of a lot of space for nothing. Likewise, if those messages are saved in your personal files,<br>those attachments are taking up file space.<br>(U//FOUO) Many thanks to <br>Chief, CES Desktop and Infrastructure Services,<br>S31521, for his help in working out the details of the extraneous attachments and for providing<br>the websites for creating the UNIX signature blocks and the policy SPF.<br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: If you have an editorial to submit , please<br>contact us!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
