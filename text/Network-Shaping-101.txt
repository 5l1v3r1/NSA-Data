What This Will Cover

•	Caveats

•	Example network we will work with

•	What shaping would look like for that network

•	Basic shaping problems

•	A bit more advanced shaping problems

Initial caveats

•	To understand how to do shaping, and why it does/doesn’t work
sometimes, you have to go back to networking basics

•	To get the most of this presentation, you should already understand
how IP’s, CIDR’s and Autonomous Systems (ASN) work

•	Some ips/facts are just made up. This presentation uses Yemennet
as our target network. This info is outdated and incomplete. Don’t
use any of this information for any real analysis

You’re gonna talk about Layer 2 shaping

right?

Example network - Yemen

•	Yemen has 1 ASN (AS12486)

•	We’ll pretend it has 6 upstream providers

-	Mobily (AS35819)

-	TATA (AS6453)

-	FLAG (AS15412)

-	PCCW (AS3491)

-	STC (AS39386)

-	SPRINT (AS1239)

AS12486

This network owns the following IP ranges:

46.35.64.0/19, 89.189.64.0/19, 46.35.72.0/21, 109.74.32.0/20,
46.32.80.0/21, 109.74.40.0/21, 63.168.168.0/23,
109.200.160.0/19, 63.171.18.0/23, 109.200.168.0/21

So, when we reference AS12486, you can assume it includes
any IP address that falls within any of the above ranges.

Connectivity for this network could be

viewed like:

12486 Yemennet

Okay, so traffic for Yemen has to go
—through 1 of 6 providers, so?

Armed with this high-level knowledge of Yemen’s connectivity, think
about what that means:

-	Yemennet has to have a router that connects it’s own network
with it’s upstream providers. That router is going to have a
unique interface and IP address for each connection.

-	That router has to use physical cables to connect between
Yemennet and each upstream provider (think big Transnational
undersea fiber cables).

-	Yemennet *CAN* control which upstream provider it sends data
*OUT* of the country through (because it controls the router
that’s sending the data out).

-	Yemennet *CAN NOT* control which provider the data comes
back *IN* to the country through, because that is left to BGP
routing tables out on the Internet.

Yemennet and its upstream providers. You can see here

which cables are used.

So to recap:

•	You understand the logical connectivity of Yemennet (who it has to
go through to get to the Internet)

•	You grasp the physical connectivity of Yemennet (you know which
fiber cables physically connect it to the rest of the world)

•	You know that Yemennet can choose which provider it sends data
*OUT* through

•	Big Internet BGP routing tables can dynamically choose which link
data comes back *IN* to Yemennet through

•	There are a couple more things to know before we talk about
shaping...

About that router that connects
—Yemennet to it’s peers...

•	Remember how I mentioned that router has a different interface and
unique IP address for each upstream provider? That router will have
at least 7 interfaces (one for each upstream, and one connected to
the rest of it’s network).

•	The connection between the router and an upstream provider has to
use IPs that are in the same subnet (normally it’s a /30 subnet, which
consists of 2 usable IPs).

•	This means that one of the two networks will have to sacrifice an IP
address to put on the other end of the connection (most of the time
it’s the bigger network that gives up an IP address to assign to the
customer side’s router).

•	So, if we were to use the connection with SPRINT for example,
here’s what it might look like.

Note that the IP address on Yemen’s side of it’s connection with
Sprint, is an IP address that belongs to SPRINT. This is because
one of the two networks has to use one of their IP’s on the other
end of the connection.

Router on Yemen’s end of the
connection: 144.232.234.150

WARNING! WARNING!

•	In the following slides when I talk about SSO collection capabilities, I
am completely MAKING UP:

-	SIGADs

-	Case notations

-	Which cables are collected

-	Where SSO’s collection capabilities are

•	I am MAKING UP this info for the sake of this lesson.

•	For info on what SSO’s capabilities are for your own target, you will
have to go talk to them yourself.

WARNING 2! WARNING 2!

•	For the sake of this example, I am assuming that all of Yemennet’s
International links are equal. By that I am making the assumptions
that:

-	An equal amount of traffic is going in/out each link

-	Yemennet is not doing anything to manipulate traffic going over
specific links

-	All links are actually active, and are not just backups or down due
to maintenance or cable breaks...

•	With that out of the way.

■So now you have a good idea about
-------------Yemen’s connectivity...

•	Now time to overlay it with SIGINT collect.

•	Without going into how to do this yourself, work with SSO to
determine which of those links we can passively collect.

•	Let’s pretend that they have capabilities to collect the Yemen-Sprint
link and the Yemen-FLAG link, but have no capabilities on the rest.

•	Once again, this is only PRETEND for the sake of this lesson.

Here is what our passive collection capabilities

would look like for Yemen...

So, remembering what we talked about in the
beginning, here’s what we can tell...

12486 Yemennet

If data *happens* to go in or out the FLAG or Sprint links for Yemen, we will
collect those comms.

12486 Yemennet

If data does *NOT* go in or out the FLAG or Sprint links for Yemen, we will
*NOT* collect those comms.

So, now you know what our passive collection posture against Yemennet is like...
we may only collect about 33% (2 out of 6 links) for all of the country’s traffic (this
is assuming they send and receive equal amounts of traffic over each of the links).

Now that you’re an expert on Yemennet,
-------let’s talk about shaping

•	The purpose of “shaping” is taking traffic that wouldn’t normally go
through one of our passive links, and *making* it go through one of
our passive links, so we can collect it and get it into the SIGINT
system.

•	Before we talk about how to shape traffic on Yemennet, let’s explore
a couple different scenarios in which we would consider shaping as a
solution...they will be shaping traffic OUT of Yemennet, and shaping
traffic INTO Yemennet.

Shaping traffic OUT of Yemennet

•	For this scenario, you have an access (probably CNE) inside of
Yemennet, and you want to make that access send traffic, but make
sure it goes out over a link that is passively collected by SSO.

•	You need a DESTINATION on the Internet where you can send data
to, where you know it will go over 1 of the 2 links we can collect.

•	Earlier I mentioned that Yemennet can control which links they send
data OUT. This is true, Yemennet has that control, however, you, as
an end-user on their network do *NOT* have that control.

•	So, how can you control which link your traffic will go out through?

If you send traffic from somewhere inside Yemennet to some random
place on the Internet, you are at Yemennet’s mercy as to which link it

will send the data out through.

Exfil data

12486 Yemennet

SUCCESS! The exfil will probably die somewhere in Sprint’s network, but we don’t care,
because we accomplished our goal of collecting it along the way. Now we can go look at
collect from US-8888 CASN: YM567800000 for our exfil!

■So in order to shape traffic OUT of a
----------------------------n etwo rk

•	You need to have an understanding of the network that you are
starting in, who it’s upstream providers are, and what the collection
capabilities are against that network.

•	Then you can find a destination IP address directly on the other end
of that link (by looking at any of the IP ranges in that provider’s ASN).

•	From there, you have a higher probability that traffic will traverse a
link you can passively collect.

Shaping traffic INTO a network

•	This is a whole different animal, and probably more relevant to what
people traditionally think of as “shaping” in the SIGINT sense.

•	There is only 1 feasible way (that I can think of) to make this work
reliably.

•	But first, let’s go back and look at our Internet connectivity...

In order to shape traffic into a network, we’ll be starting from some
random place on the Internet. Somewhere in here...

12486 Yemennet

12486 Yemennet

But remember, the route for traffic going into Yemennet is completely at the mercy of BGP
routing tables out on the Internet. So there is no guarantee that it will go through one of
the links we can collect (once again, only a 33% shot).

12486 Yemennet

Wow, that didn’t work. © So, if we are completely at the mercy of big Internet routing
tables, how could we reliably send traffic from ANYWHERE in the Internet into Yemennet
while guaranteeing it goes through passive collect?

12486 Yemennet

There are a few options you can use to try to make that happen...

12486 Yemennet

1	- You can try to tweak the BGP routing tables to make your 2 links the most attractive for
inbound traffic...

12486 Yemennet

That *could* work, but 2 bad things would result from this:

1	- It’s a pretty noisy thing to do on the Internet. People would notice bad BGP updates.

2	- You would throttle ALL Internet traffic through those 2 links, which Yemennet would probably notice.

12486 Yemennet

Or.. .you could blow up or cut all of the International links that we can’t collect! ©
That’s fun to think about, but not very reasonable. ©

12486 Yemennet

There is another way that might work...we’ll have to go back to one of our previous maps
though...

12486 Yemennet

Remember the /30 connections between Yemen and each

of the upstream providers...

It actually looks a bit more like this...

-	Whoa, that looks kinda messy, what do I really need to take away from this slide?

-	Good question, just keep in mind the fact that each provider has put one of *their own* IP
addresses in Yemen for those connections. Here’s why it matters...

Remember, if you do a traceroute to a random IP address in AS12486, you won’t

know which link it will go through to get there...

But, hypothetically, what happens if you do a traceroute to 86.51.2.110 (the Yemen side of
its Mobily connection) from some random place on the Internet?

-Ok, it went where I expected it to go...what’s so special about that?

- First, keep in mind the IP we traced to belongs to Mobily, not Yemennet. So the traffic will first get routed
to Mobily’s network. From there, it happens to reside on a router belonging to Yemennet.

-AAAAAND?

- By tracing to the Mobily IP on Yemennet’s router, we forced the trace to go through Mobily to get there.
What happens if we did that for FLAG’S IP address?

Starting traceroute from anywhere on the Internet to 62.216.145.130...

Starting traceroute from anywhere on the Internet to 62.216.145.130...

We have just successfully forced traffic to go through FLAG’S network and over a link that
we can collect! <throws confetti in the air>

So, it seems we have found a good candidate to shape traffic to from anywhere!

Scenario - “I tried shaping one time and

-----------------it didn’t work...”

•	As we’ve seen earlier, there are many facets that make shaping
efforts unreliable

•	It matters whether you are trying to shape traffic OUT of a network or
whether you are starting at a random place on the Internet and trying
to shape traffic INTO the network

•	So what steps could you take?

■So, you might consider the following
-----------------train of thought...

•	First you say, “I want to do shaping through SIGAD US-9999”

•	Then look at all of the links collected at that site (probably in
BLACKPEARL)

•	Find a World-to-Geekistan link over CASN GE010100000 (we’ll
assume you also know that this is actually a Level 3-to-Geekistan
link)

•	Look at the IP space on the dest side of the link and say, “I will send
my exfil to that IP space, and it should go through US-9999, CASN
GE010100000.”

•	Then you are left sorely disappointed when your exfil isn’t reliably
collected.

•	What went wrong? Let’s consider what we know so far.

This isn’t a bad start for network knowledge, but there’s still
some missing pieces...

Level 3

SIGAD - US-9999

CASN-GE010100000

For example, do you know if Level 3 is the *ONLY* upstream
provider for Geekistan? Or are there other ways for traffic to get
in and out of that network? How would you find out?

Level 3

SIGAD - US-9999

ASN.

there.

what do you do

If you are bound and determined to shape traffic into Geekistan,
you need to do 1 of 2 things...

Cogent

V

SIGAD - US-9999

CASN-GE010100000

1 - You’ll need to find passive collection on both the Cogent and
Sprint links with Geekistan. If you do, then you can have
confidence in collecting exfil as you shape it into that network.

Cogent

2 - You’ll need to identify the Level 3 IP address that is on the
Geekistan side of the connection, and send exfil directly to that
IP address...

If you do your research, and realize that Level 3 is the *only*
connection Geekistan has to the rest of the Internet, and you are
collecting that link, then you’re safer to assume your exfil will get
collected if you send it to anywhere in that network...

Now to the nittier-grittier...

•	This following section could also be renamed the “I’m pulling my hair
out in the fetal position while screaming ‘Why didn’t it work?!’”
section.

•	The previous slides described how shaping should work at a
theoretical level, following are a few reasons why it doesn’t always
work in the real world.

•	The following issues are not all-encompassing of why shaping might
not work, just a few examples.

First, the multiple links problem.

Below, the graph looks really pretty with 1 link per upstream
provider, but that isn’t always the case. Sometimes it’s like this:

Notice how there are 2 links between Geekistan ASN and Level
3. It is not abnormal for ASNs to have multiple links to eachother
for redundancy reasons.

Why this matters, is if we are only able to collect 1 of the 2 links,
even if we try to force our exfil into/out of the Level 3-Geekistan
ASN link, we can’t guarantee it will traverse the link we collect.

Even if we try to shoot directly at the Level 3 interface that we
*can* collect on, there’s a chance it could go over the *other*
Level 3 link to get there...

Next, there is the “back-up” link problem. In the ISP world,
bandwidth is money, and some people charge more for letting
your data traverse their networks...

Say, for example, it was *twice* as expensive for Geekistan to
send data through Level 3 as it is for Cogent or Sprint. They
would use Level 3 as little as possible (as in, only when
necessary), while using the other 2 as much as they can.

If they try to force traffic in/out Cogent and Sprint, that could spell
bad news for our shaping efforts, we might see something like
this:

If we try to send data directly over the Level 3 link, we might be
sorely disappointed with Geekistan forcing us over a different
link...

Or it might look something like this if we tried to exfil *out*
directly into Level 3’s network...

SIGAD - US-9999

CASN-GE010100000

Lastly (for now), is the infamous collection problem...

Pretend all the stars aligned...there is only 1 Level 3 link, we
*can* send data over it, and we *do* have access to it at SIGAD
US-9999...

In a fit of joy we start sending exfil over that link. Then we go
look at US-9999, GE010100000 for our exfil, and find that *it
isn’t there*!

Without going into the gory details, US-9999 may be dropping
your exfil (as in, ‘able to see it, but not collecting and processing
it’). If you think this is the case, please coordinate with SSO to
make sure appropriate IP’s/protocols are promoted at the site.
