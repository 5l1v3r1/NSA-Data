It is a tool that<br>combines Special Weather Intelligence (SWI) reporting with ArcIMS technology to interpret and<br>display real-time weather, from normally denied areas (i.e. not available through open sources),<br>at the click of a mouse. ArcIMS Weather was developed by the combined efforts of the GIS<br>Solutions Division (S2L2) and Regional Targets' Worldwide Weather Branch (S2A15).<br>(S//SI) With ArcIMS Weather, the warfighter, intelligence analyst, planner or decision-maker can<br>view the target environment with unprecedented flexibility and responsiveness, and can make<br>operational decisions based on the latest weather updates. The tool will also support a rapidly<br>growing Intelligence Community and DOD demand for an operational, cost-effective method to<br>access SWI by reaching out to 65,000 Intelligence and Defense Community personnel via<br>INTELINK.<br>(S//SI) ArcIMS has an easy-to-use application interface. All the customer needs is Internet<br>Explorer and a Java plug-in. (In future, the website will be viewable in multiple browsers and not<br>require a Java plug-in.) Over half of the six million annual weather reports that S2A15 processes<br>annually are available on ArcIMS Weather. The tool operates from a "live feed" with data<br>constantly updating from the time that the user first accesses the webpage. Future upgrades to<br>the website will provide archiving capabilities, as well.<br><br>(S//SI) The data is displayed in a stoplight format (red/green/yellow), with red indicating bad<br>weather and green indicating good weather (based on aviation parameters). This format<br>provides the customer with an overall quick assessment. Click on a dot and an attribute window<br>is displayed with easy-to-read details. The "stoplight" represents a significant upgrade from the<br>standard weather code. It reduces time spent looking for the data -- one click and you have<br>your information. Previously, users needed to click 5-6 times and then use a "cheat sheet" to<br>break down the code.<br>(U//FOUO) To get started, open Microsoft Internet Explorer and type in "go swi" (<br> ).
