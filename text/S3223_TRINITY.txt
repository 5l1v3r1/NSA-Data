TRINITY

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL) TRINITY is a miniaturized digital core packaged in a Multi-Chip Module
(MCM) to be used in implants with size constraining concealments.

08/05/08

(TS//SI//REL) TRINITY uses the TAO standard implant architecture. The architecture
provides a robust, reconfigurable, standard digital platform resulting in a dramatic
performance improvement over the obsolete HC12 microcontroller based designs. A
development Printed Circuit Board (PCB) using packaged parts has been developed and is
available as the standard platform. The TRINITY Multi-Chip-Module (MCM) contains an
ARM9 microcontroller, FPGA, Flash and SDRAM memories.
