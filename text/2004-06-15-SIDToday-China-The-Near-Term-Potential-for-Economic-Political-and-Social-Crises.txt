A hard<br>landing for China's overheating economy would most likely further<br>complicate the political landscape for the PRC leadership by<br>introducing another key variable into the equation.<br>(C) Together these issues touch upon both of the Chinese<br>Communist Party's key sources of legitimacy - its ability to<br>maintain territorial integrity and to sustain economic development.<br>Consequently, these three issues will likely dominate Chinese<br>decision-makers' thinking for the next six months.<br>(C) The Chinese economy's ability to absorb East Asian exports has<br>allowed it to play the role of regional economic engine. An<br>economic slow-down in China would therefore have significant<br>consequences for the rest of the region. A short-term decline for<br>the Chinese economy, particularly if it derails Japan's nascent<br>export-driven recovery, could also affect the United States, which<br>exports over 250 billion dollars in goods and services to the region.<br>(C) The possibility of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait or in Hong Kong<br>will challenge stability in the region. A major Chinese crackdown in<br>Hong Kong could draw the United States and the international<br>community into a human rights situation, and could endanger SinoAmerican cooperation in a host of fields, including counterterrorism<br>and the Six-Party Talks. Furthermore, the US military could be<br>drawn into a crisis in the Taiwan Strait at a time in which defense<br>assets are already stretched thin by existing overseas<br>commitments.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) SINIO<br>Council Intelligence<br>Issues <br>1.
