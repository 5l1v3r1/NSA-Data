The SID Deployment Coin is in recognition of the<br>exemplary service and performance of the men and women of the NSA/CSS who have deployed<br>overseas in support of SID in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Operation Iraqi Freedom<br>(OIF). They have displayed superior technical skill, dedication to the mission, and extraordinary<br>professionalism in providing actionable intelligence to the warfighter.<br>(U//FOUO) Who will be awarded a SID Deployment Coin? The criteria are as follows: If you are<br>an NSA/CSS civilian or military personnel who were deployed overseas to a hazardous location<br>in support of the SID organization on official orders for at least a 30-day period (since 9/11/01),<br>you are authorized to receive the SID Deployment Coin. The SID Deployment Coin will be<br>presented to SID personnel deployed to dangerous/hostile locations within the US CENTCOM<br>AOR; however, enabler personnel and other geographical areas may be eligible based on a caseby-case decision by me or an official designated by me.<br>(U//FOUO) On 27 July, I will conduct the first ceremony in the Friedman Auditorium to present<br>SID Deployment coins to those who have returned between 1 January and 31 May 2004. The<br>number of people who are invited to this ceremony totals approximately 85 civilians and military<br>members. We are currently working to establish a list of those who deployed and returned<br>between 9/11/01 and 12/31/03. Those individuals will receive their coin through their chain of<br>command. Those SIGINT'ers who deployed from one of the RSOCs, or a mission ground station,<br>or any other part of the extended enterprise, will also receive their coin through their chains of<br>command. <br>, the SID Senior Enlisted Advisor, is responsible for locating military<br>members who have changed duty locations since their TDY.<br>(U//FOUO) Future ceremonies will be conducted quarterly to present SID Deployment Coins to<br>those who have completed their deployment since the last ceremony, and coins will continue to<br>be supplied to the extended enterprise for presentation. Those eligible to receive the coin who<br>have not been contacted by 1 September 2004 should send an email to "DL POST ITS" (or<br>@nsa); include your name, dates and location of deployment.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
