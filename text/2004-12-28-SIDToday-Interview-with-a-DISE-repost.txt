What are the pros and cons of being one? Here's one<br>executive's view, first posted in February 2004... (U)<br>(U) What do you consider the role of a DISE to be? How does it differ from that of a GS<br>employee or a DISL?<br>(U) I am going to guess that, if you asked every Defense Intelligence Senior Executive (DISE)<br>that question, there would be no shortage of ideas of what that role is. You can get the pat<br>answer from the "competencies" which a DISES candidate and DISE must exhibit to either enter<br>or remain in the DISES, but my name isn't Pat. From my perspective, the principle role of an<br>NSA "senior" is to think, plan, and act at the strategic level in order to ensure that we are<br>prepared to accomplish the mission, do indeed accomplish it, and finally learn corporately from<br>what we did.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA has a long and illustrious history of being able to handle any crisis that comes to<br>visit our nation or its allies. We think and act tactically. Give us a crisis, a disaster, or a war, and<br>we focus like a laser on getting the job done. We don't much care what sacrifices are involved.<br>Accomplishing the mission is what we live and breathe. It drives us. It nourishes us. It sustains<br>us. I know of no group of people on the planet that is more dedicated to their mission or who<br>can do it better. By the way, the mission is preserving the safety and well being of our country<br>and its interests.<br>(U//FOUO) It is rarely something that even those with the most Pollyanna-ish outlook on life<br>would associate with fun. However, someone has to devote their attention to ensuring that the<br>national treasure we all know as NSA can continue to avoid or shorten conflict, give our policy<br>makers and our military commanders the decisive edge, and save lives. Someone needs to labor<br>to ensure that: <br>-- resources are available to work our miracles, <br>-- people with the right skills are here to do the job and are properly nurtured, <br>-- the individuals and the organizations duly elected by our fellow citizens know we are focused<br>on the security of the nation and are spending their very hard-earned tax dollars as wisely and<br>as effectively as possible, and <br>-- we appropriately collaborate with our partners to our mutual advantage.<br>This unglamorous -- but critically necessary -- task falls in large part to what we, affectionately<br>or otherwise, refer to as seniors.<br>What is the best part of being a DISE? ...the hardest part?<br>(U//FOUO) The best part of being a DISE is being privy to the strategic picture and being<br>positioned to influence operational and personnel decisions at that level. For this former SOO,<br>nothing is more stimulating and fulfilling than current operations, but prosecuting current<br>operations doesn't happen by accident. In order to enable those wonderful things done daily by<br>the vast majority of us, you need to know where the nation is going, establish the goals and<br>objectives to move you in that direction, and ensure that the corporation has the resources to<br>realize the goals and objectives.<br>(U//FOUO) Like never before in NSA's history, the DISE population is knowledgeable of exactly<br>where the Director is leading us and has ample opportunity to influence the actual<br>implementation of our corporate goals. Getting to know the future superstars in the GG13 to<br>GG15 range and working with them to help them to realize the potential they already exhibit<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">makes my day and assures me that NSA will have superb leadership in the future. I have<br>mentoring relationships of varying degrees of formality and informality with almost 20 great<br>people. The time spent with them is often hard to find, but it is one of the highlights of my<br>career.<br>(U//FOUO) The hardest part is no longer being involved doing the work that makes NSA a<br>national treasure. I was hired as a linguist and spent my first 25 years on the production side of<br>the house doing language, analysis and reporting related tasks. I then moved over to the access<br>and collection side of the equation and enjoyed that tremendously as well. It was great fun and<br>about as intellectually rewarding as anyone has a right to expect. I miss the rush of pulling<br>together a report that is going to arm the President with information to win the day for the<br>nation. Now I am focused on getting the resources so others can do that work and trying to<br>ensure an environment conducive to their success, professionally and personally.<br>What are the "must have" talents a person needs to succeed as a DISE?<br>(U) Any DISE worth his/her salt needs a sense of perspective, a good sense of humor, a long<br>memory for excellent interaction with others and total amnesia regarding real or perceived<br>wrongs, a bias toward working as a member of a team, character above reproach, complete<br>candor and unimpeachable loyalty, a strong desire to get involved with and nurture the people<br>around him/her, a preference for managing rather than avoiding risks, patience, and a paucity of<br>the "vertical pronoun" (I) in his/her vocabulary.<br>What advice would you give to someone who would like to become a DISE? What<br>training/experience should that person seek out?<br>(U) Have a long discussion with your spouse, family, significant other, yourself. Make absolutely<br>certain you both/all agree that you can live with potentially long hours, a good deal of real and<br>self-imposed pressure, occasional missed family events and meals, and remember that a<br>healthy, functional family is probably the most important factor in your professional success and<br>your mental and physical health.<br>(U) If you are of one accord on that front, find a mentor who shares your values and believes in<br>you. Let providence take you where it will. If you never get elevated, you still know your family<br>loves you, you live in the greatest nation on the globe, you are making a difference for your<br>fellow Americans and those you love, you undoubtedly have a job twice as interesting as anyone<br>outside the IC, you are well paid, you are eating regularly, you have never slept on a grate....<br>You get the picture. Your value as a tremendous asset to your country, your family and your<br>Agency will never hinge upon elevation. God bless America!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
