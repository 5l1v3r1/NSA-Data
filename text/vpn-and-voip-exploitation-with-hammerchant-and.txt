VPN Phase 1: IKE Metadata 0an (Spin 15)
- IKE packets are extiled to TURMOIL APEX.
. APEX reconstructs/reinjects IKE packets to the TURIVIOIL VPN components.

- TURMOIL VPN extracts metadata from each key exchange and sends to the
CES TOYGIFIIPPE metadata database. This database is used by SIGDEV
to Identify potential targets for further eprOItatIon.

VPN Phase 2: Targeted IKE Forwarding (Spin 15)
- TURMOIL VPN looks up IKE packet IP addresses in KEYCARD.

- If either IP address is targeted the key exchange ackets are forwarded to
the CES Attack Orchestrator (POISON NUT) for PM key recovery.

VPN Phase 3: Static Tasking of ESP
- HAMMERSTEIN receives static tasking to extil targeted ESP packets.
. APEX reconstructs/reinjects ESP packets to the TURIVIOIL VPN components.
- TURMOIL VPN requests VPN key from CES and attempts 

VPN Phase 4: Dynamic Targeting of ESP

- Based on the value returned by KEYCARD, the ESP tor a particular VPN may
be targeted as well.

- TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN (Klia TURBINE) the parameters for
capturing the ESP for the targeted VP .

VOIP Phase 1: Static TaskinCl 0i VOIP (SDin 16)

- HAMMERCHANT monitors VolP signaling and extiltrates only targeted VolP
RTP sessions to TURMOIL.

- APEX reconstructs and bundles the voice Backets into a file, attaches appropriate
metadata, and delivers to PRESSUREWA E.

I This triggers a modified VolP analytic to prepare the VolP for corporate delivery.

Phase 2. Call Survey

- HAMMERCHANT monitors VolP signaling and extiltrates all call signaling
metadata to 

- APEX inserts call signaling metadata into an ASDF record and publishes it to the
Asdtheporter component for target SIGDEV.

Phase 3. Dynamic Targeting of 

HAMMERSTEIN captures/exfils all VolP signaling

APEX reconstructs/reinjects the Signaling to the TU RMOIL VolP components.

TURIVIOIL VolP extracts call metadata and sends to checks KEYCARD for hits.

If called/callin party is targeted for active exfil, then TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN
(Via TU RBINI the parameters to capture the targeted session.

 

Implementation of VolP Phase 2 and 3 will be driven by mission need.

- Phase 3 levera es all TURMQIL VolP si nalin protocol processors to expand beyond
SIP and H.323 e.g. Skype) without addi ional evelopment on the implan .
