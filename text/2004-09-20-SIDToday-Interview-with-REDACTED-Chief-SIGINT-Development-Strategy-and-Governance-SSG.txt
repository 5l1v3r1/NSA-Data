We sat near the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula for three months<br>at a time and collected telemetry associated with Soviet Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles<br>(ICBM), Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM), and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles<br>(SLBM) reentry vehicles.<br> <br>USS Observation Island <br>(S//SI) Soviet Navy trawlers used to follow us around, attempting to do SIGINT collection of<br>their own against us ! Their boats were relatively small, and the seas could get pretty rough in<br>that part of the Pacific. Sometimes we could see Soviet operators sitting with their headsets on,<br>listening, even as their boat was being tossed about. Because of its larger size, Observation<br>Island is much more stable. In fact, when a huge new X-Band radar antenna was installed on the<br>ship at our homeport in Japan some years ago, steps were taken to make sure that the ship<br>would not be too top-heavy: dozens of cement trucks dumped their loads into the hold of the<br>ship for three days running. Weather permitting, the antenna could be turned into the wind and<br>used as a sail when the ship was in transit.<br>(U) What was your first job at the Agency?<br>(U//FOUO) After retiring from a career in the U.S. Army (Chief Warrant Officer), I hired on with<br>the company ESL/TRW as a system engineer responsible for maintaining a mainframe-based<br>digital signal processing system. I worked as a TRW contractor here at NSA in the Office of<br>Weapons and Space for many years. Then, in 1989, I became an Agency employee. My first job<br>was branch chief of W323, Analysis Engineering, where we managed the development of digital<br>recorders, intercept receivers, and signals analysis tools.<br>(U) If you could change one thing at the Agency, what would it be?<br>(U//FOUO) I think that we could consider the idea of designing our tools and interfaces so that<br>personnel at different skill levels can use them. Many of our applications seem to be designed for<br>expert users, one-size-fits-all. Yet, there will always be entry level employees, to include junior<br>military, who may not have the background knowledge to make full use all of the tools'<br>capabilities without considerable training investment. If we could run different "levels" of our<br>applications - one for beginners, another for experts - it would really help the new people<br>become productive faster. The "beginners" version would be more intuitive and do more to help<br>guide the users on how to use it. In effect, the software would be helping perform OJT.<br>(U) What's the most exciting project for the future that your organization is currently<br>working on?<br>(S//SI) SID is standing up the Global Network Development Activity (GNDA) as a means for<br>closing the SIGINT Development gap for Special Source accesses and pursuing the development<br>of targets across multiple accesses. To the greatest extend possible, Special Source, end point<br>and FORNSAT access data feeds will be exploited in the GNDA in order to create as accurate a<br>view of Global Information Infrastructure access environments.
