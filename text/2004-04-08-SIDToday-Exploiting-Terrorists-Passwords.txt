(See the previous article on SIGINT forensics .) Researchers in Pod<br>31 realized that data in these computers are a rich source of passwords and related information,<br>and set about finding ways to exploit this information.<br>(S//SI) The Pod's suite of tools automatically scans text documents, e-mails, web pages and<br>other files to identify passwords. In this manner they harvested hundreds of thousands of<br>occurrences of passwords, some accompanied by collateral account information, all of which can<br>be used to support SIGINT exploitation in various ways.<br>(TS//SI) For example, these passwords can be used to aid in password-guessing against<br>encrypted files found on the hard drives. Not only might passwords be re-used by targets, but<br>they may also fall into a pattern that SID can use to tailor our password guesses. Preliminary<br>results are promising: in a couple of instances the pod researchers collaborated with the SIGINT<br>Forensics Lab and the JUMBLEDPET password-guessing team to break very hard passwords with<br>little work.<br>(TS//SI) Passwords can also be used to aid in computer network operations, and to link<br>individuals who use common passwords. In one instance, intelligence analysts were able to<br>relate caches of documents which might not have otherwise been discovered. Together with the<br>Forensics Lab, the CNE Technical Development branch, and the JUMBLEDPET team, the<br>researchers continue to pursue ways to exploit this novel collection of data.<br>(U//FOUO) This work was done in SID Research Pod 31: Information Diagnosis Evaluation and<br>Assessment (IDEA), which has been investigating ways to better exploit computer media data<br>using prioritization algorithms and other approaches. Research pods are run under the auspices<br>of the Technical Advocate Office in Data Acquisition.<br>(U//FOUO) Questions can be directed to Mike O'Hara (<br>nsa).<br><br>nsa) or <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
