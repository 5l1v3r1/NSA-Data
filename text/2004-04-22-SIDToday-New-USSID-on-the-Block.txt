IO is defined as "Actions taken to affect<br>adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and<br>information systems." In recent years, IO has become a large and growing mission for the<br>SIGINT Enterprise: it is an area that affects most SIGINT product lines.<br>(S//SI) Furthermore, all three SID Deputy Directorates have organizations that are fully<br>dedicated to IO, such as:<br>The Information Warfare Support Center (S15) in the Customer Relationships<br>Directorate,<br>SIGINT Support to IO (S2K) in Analysis &amp; Production, and<br>Tailored Access Operations (S32) in Data Acquisition.<br>...Add to this the efforts of the Extended Enterprise and our interaction with the IO Technology<br>Center (IOTC), and you can see that IO is a major part of the SIGINT business.<br>(S//SI) USSID 430 represents a much-needed overall SID policy for this burgeoning field. It<br>complements SID's pre-existing " Policy &amp; Guidance on Reporting Digital Network Intelligence<br>Communications " (CR-365-01), and relates SID policies with established DoD and DCI<br>directives.<br>(U//FOUO) You can access USSID 430 in Webworld .
