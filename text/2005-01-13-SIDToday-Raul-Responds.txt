DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Raul Responds<br>FROM: Raul<br>A DNI Analyst<br>Run Date: 01/13/2005<br><br>(U) Ooooh, weeeeee!!! Dog my cats and corn my pone! My last article obviously hit a few<br>nerves. So I'll provide a little feedback to the feedback .<br>(U) Even as old and ancient as Old Raul is, he can still learn a few things. First, in all future<br>articles I'll be absolutely sure to specify things so as not to allow folks to read into what my<br>point is. Also, I have to be careful in my choice of words.<br>(U) In my last article I used the word "considered" meaning a well thought out response by both<br>the technical and managerial sides of the house to the PDF processing problem. I did not simply<br>mean whether anyone, while eating a hamburger or chewing a stick of gum, had happened to<br>consider any of the issues I mentioned in the article. Obviously many folks, including myself,<br>had. Whether anyone had "considered" the issue(s) at all was not my point. Mea culpa. Having<br>said that, here we go.<br>(U) Before we start skinning the chipmunks, let me spell out a few of the requirements one, or<br>at least Raul, would surely think should have gone into a "considered" solution. Here they are:<br>1.  There are two areas to be addressed: processing for selection and filtering and<br>processing for display. If we can come up with one solution adequate for both, fine. If<br>not, then we'll have to have multiple solutions.<br>2.  In both cases above, the processes have to be capable of handling damaged data. No<br>exception here.<br>3.  Whatever the solution is, it has to be readily available to the analyst (i.e. available via<br>the standard processing &amp; display tools and compatible with the operating system the<br>analyst uses). If I have to call ten people, mail or ftp the thing and then wait days, weeks<br>or months for a response, and then perhaps go to a special computer to view the output,<br>well, that's just not going to cut it. You'd be amazed at how many people around here<br>think that is a perfectly reasonable way of doing business.<br>4.  Since we are the National Security Agency, the process has to be able to handle foreign<br>language material and if used for selection and filtering, must output all text and images<br>in standard formats that are compatible with standard processing and display tools.<br>5.  The appropriate resources have to be made available to ensure success. Success doesn't<br>mean perfection. Let's say it's that famous 80% solution. 80% though does not mean it<br>does 4 of 5 things and doesn't do the 5th at all.<br>(U/FOUO) Now, having said all that, let me note that not one alternative sent as feedback fit the<br>bill. Either the solution couldn't handle damaged data or foreign text or wasn't available to the<br>masses or was no better and perhaps worse than just trying to slog along with Adobe Acrobat<br>Reader 4. Bin Laden is still safe and we, to the best of my knowledge, still have no reasonable<br>solution to the PDF problem. But in case I'm wrong, and you have a working solution that meets<br>the requirements above, please let me know.<br>Happy New Year!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
