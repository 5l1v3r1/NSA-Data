(U//FOUO) UTT Dataflow

(U//FOUO) This Readme file is intended as an aid for setting up the appropriate configurations to load,
ingest, and scan data against UTT tasking. It does NOT address forwarding selected traffic to PINWALE.
Configuring XKEYSCORE for UTT can be accomplished in three phases. First, you will address three pré-
configuration requirements. Next you will configure xks.config and xks. enhanced.config to enable UTT
tasking and appropriate MAILORDER routing. Last, you will execute a group of set-up processes to
ensure all configuration changes are fully implemented.

(U) Pre-Configuration Requirements

(U//FOUO) The Unified Targeting Tool (UTT) works hand-in-hand with the Site Selection Distribution
Manager (SSDM). Therefore you must have:

- an SSDM in place at the field site.

the SSDM's routing trigraph so XKEYSCORE can send response messages back to the SSDM.
a routing trigraph for the XKEYSCORE Master.
