In the interest of fair and<br>balanced reporting, we want to mention a brand-new competitor to RSS - the Atom Syndication<br>Format.<br>(U//FOUO) Although RSS is still widely popular on the World Wide Web, it does have its<br>shortcomings, mainly due to the fact that the RSS 2.0 specification is "frozen." Atom intends to<br>address many of the shortcomings of RSS, including development of an Atom API* and<br>sponsorship of the Atom standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, the<br>most obvious evidence to date of the potential success of Atom is that Google has elected to<br>bypass RSS in favor of Atom as its syndication standard.<br>(U//FOUO) If you would like more information about RSS, Atom, or content syndication in<br>general, please contact the NSOC web team (DL NSOCWEB) at <br>NSTS.<br>*(U) API = Application Program Interface<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
