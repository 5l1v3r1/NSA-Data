(U) SIGINT Year in Review, November 2011

FROM: Teresa H. Shea

Director, Signals Intelligence Directorate

Run Date: 11/22/2011

(U) Introduction

(U) Colleagues: As I mark my first anniversary as SIGINT Director, it seems fitting to take a look back
on what the SIGINT enterprise accomplished over the past year... and what a year it was! We were
challenged with supporting the military campaigns related to the war on terrorism and the crises in the
Middle East, natural disasters, global technological changes — in addition to the ongoing demands of
follow ing our enduring targets. Not only did you respond brilliantly to all of these challenges, but you
also continued to move forward with long-term enhancements to our capabilities and ways of
operating that will pay dividends in the months and years ahead.

(U) As you read this account of what we accomplished together over the last year, I think you will be
reminded that it isn’t just one person or group that makes us successful, but rather every clement of the
Enterprise plays an indispensible role. In addition, we should always remember that we stand on the
shoulders of those who have gone before us that built the SIGINT Enterprise. We owe them all a debt
of gratitude.
