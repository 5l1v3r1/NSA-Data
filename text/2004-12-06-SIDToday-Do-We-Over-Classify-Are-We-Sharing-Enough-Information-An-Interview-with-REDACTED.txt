An<br>Interview with <br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/06/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) <br> Chief of SIGINT Policy, Congressional Issues &amp; Intelligence Security<br>(S02L), talks about classification issues, information sharing, and more...<br>(U) What is the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(U//FOUO) Certainly one of the most memorable would have to be a trip I took to Moscow in<br>1985 when I was on the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Several of us, including<br>George Tenet (who later became DCI) and Keith Hall (who went on to become Director of the<br>NRO*), were looking into the bugging of the new American embassy in Moscow and the<br>allegations of consorting with the KGB by some of the Marines stationed at the embassy. It was<br>a real eye-opener to the world of U.S. global intelligence operations and Congressional<br>oversight. Seeing things first-hand always provided invaluable perspective into some very<br>complicated issues.<br>(U) If you could change one thing at the agency, what would it be?<br>(U//FOUO) One of the things I worry about is over-classification of information. We certainly<br>have come a long way from the "No Such Agency" days, but I think we are unrealistic at times<br>about what information we try to protect from public disclosure. Make no mistake about it: we<br>have to protect our core secrets, our SIGINT and information assurance sources and methods.<br>But if we continue to insist on classifying information which has already become known to our<br>adversaries or for which disclosure would cause little or no harm to national security, we risk<br>losing control over the really sensitive stuff.<br>(U//FOUO) The Congressional committees investigating the attacks of September 11, the 9/11<br>Commission, and the Senate Intelligence Committee have all complained that NSA overclassifies too much information. My worry is that a consensus is building within Congress that<br>they need to take action to deal with this problem. Trust me, we don't want that. We need to<br>address this issue so that the solution is one of our creation and not one that is imposed on us<br>from the outside.<br>(U) What is the most exciting project for the future that your organization is currently<br>working on?<br>(U//FOUO) Information Sharing! This is one of the most important -- if not the most exciting -things going on right now at NSA and across the Intelligence Community. Particularly since 9/11<br>the Agency has been under pressure from the Congress and from other community<br>organizations to share more SIGINT in order to help "connect the dots." Some in the community<br>believe that our attitude is "we will tell you what you need." We must get this right!<br>(U//FOUO) We have to move from a climate of "need to know" to one of "need to share" without<br>compromising SIGINT sources and methods in the process. This is a complicated issue involving<br>statutory requirements, Executive Orders, policy and yes, politics. From the Director on down<br>there is a lot going on now with this issue and, again, we must get this right. If we fail, someone<br>else, whether it's the Congress, DoD* or the DCI*, will fix it for us and we will have to live with<br>the consequences.<br>(U) What was your first job at the agency?<br>(U//FOUO) For all practical purposes I had two "first jobs" at NSA. I joined NSA the first time in<br>1982 after six years with the U. S. Public Health Service. I worked in the old N2 finance and<br><br> </p>manpower organization keeping track of billets and later putting together the Congressional<br>budget books. In 1985 I resigned to join the staff of the Senate Select Committee on<br>Intelligence as the budget monitor for all of NSA's programs. I left the committee in 1994 and<br>returned to NSA.<br>(U//FOUO) My second "first job" at NSA was on the Senate team (Duh!) in the Legislative Affairs<br>Office (LAO). That job afforded me the opportunity to utilize the experience I had gained<br>working on Capitol Hill to help the Agency's senior leaders to develop a successful strategy for<br>dealing with the Congress. That was a particularly challenging and rewarding time in my career.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>NRO = National Reconnaissance Office <br>DoD = Department of Defense <br>DCI = Director of Central Intelligence <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
