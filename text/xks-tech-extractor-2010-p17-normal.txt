Tech Extractor Limitations

• While terms tasked for the Tech Extractor are applied
only to Document, E-mail and Chat bodies, that is still
a lot of traffic!

• If the term is too generic (or short) you’re still likely to
run into a lot of false hits.

Also, while you can limit your results by adding more
search criteria (country code, IP address etc), the term
will be scanning all data looking for hits
