Don't let that stop you! Read about the experience of<br>someone who began her agency career as a linguist, and never imagined that she had the skills<br>it takes to succeed as a DNI* analyst:<br>(TS//SI) Carol is a DNI analyst in the Counterterrorism (CT) SIGDEV division who had no DNI<br>experience whatsoever before coming to CT. Hired as a language intern in 1982, and following<br>11 years of experience as a certified graphic and voice linguist, certified Intelligence Analyst, and<br>senior operational staff officer, she took a break in service from 1993-2002. Following the<br>events of September 11, 2001, she reapplied to the Agency, and was rehired and assigned to CT<br>SIGDEV.<br>(TS//SI) In the summer of 2002 she took NETA3001 (DNI boot camp) and began working in<br>support of S2I22's Lebanese Hizballah mission. Her development of the Hizballah target<br>produced intelligence which enabled NSA to uncover Hizballah's operational use of E-mail to plan<br>attacks against targets in Israel. She has just begun to work the Iraq target, and provides direct<br>support to forward elements, tipping them to actionable intelligence which often leads to the<br>apprehension of terrorists.<br>(S//SI) For Carol, the job of DNI analyst in the CT Product Line is a perfect fit: it provides her<br>immense job satisfaction. She views her work as a challenging puzzle to be solved, and enjoys<br>doing research and analysis to find connections between terrorist entities. She finds her<br>management very supportive and responsive to her needs and her mentors and coworkers<br>generous with their time. When asked about her experience in CT, she bubbles over with<br>enthusiasm for the mission and her coworkers.<br>(U//FOUO) Are you, like Carol, ready to try something new?
