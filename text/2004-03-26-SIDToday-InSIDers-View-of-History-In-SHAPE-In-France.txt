DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) InSIDer's View of History : In SHAPE, In France<br>FROM: CW4<br> USA<br>Technical Director, MOC's SIGINT Development Division (S3304)<br>Run Date: 03/26/2004<br>FROM: CW4 <br> USA <br>Technical Director, MOC's SIGINT Development Division (S3304) <br>(U) When I first joined the Army over forty years ago, I was issued<br>two pair of brown boots and two cans of black leather dye. I was<br>then ordered by my Platoon Sergeant (Drill Sergeants were yet to<br>be invented) to make'em shine. This was during the Cuban Missile<br>Crisis and near the end of basic training we were informed that we<br>would all be grabbing our M1 rifles and heading off for Cuba.<br>(U) Instead, I hopped on a bus and traveled to the Brooklyn Naval<br>Yards where I caught a ship, the USS Darby, and sailed off to<br>France, by way of Dover, England where we picked up a pilot to<br>get through the Channel and then sailed on to Bremerhaven, FRG.<br>As we deboated (it's kind of like deplaning from a boat), we were<br>welcomed by a German oompah band and a crowd of well-wishers.<br>(U) This was quite a contrast to the indifference that met us upon<br>arriving by train in France. The attitude of the German people was<br>positive and they were always friendly towards Americans in<br>general, and soldiers in particular. The French still looked upon us<br>as invaders or occupiers and worked diligently to remove us from<br>their soil, which they accomplished in 1966, the year after I left.<br>(U) My first duty station was Dreux, France, which was on an Air<br>Force Base without any airplanes and only one Army company.<br>There was an old soldier in my platoon, (he was a highly decorated<br>private E2 who had a bit of difficulty hanging on to his stripes) who<br>had served with Audie Murphy during World War II. The only thing<br>that I remember about his stories was that he said that everyone<br>avoided Audie because he was prone to draw enemy fire wherever<br>he went. I guess there is a lot of truth about not sharing a foxhole<br>with anyone braver than you are.<br>(U) I was then assigned to SHAPE** HQ in Paris where I worked in<br>an underground NATO communications center. I was standing in<br>formation when the then new Canadian maple leaf flag was first<br>introduced and raised at NATO HQs. This is where I was when<br>President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. I was in the Club at<br>the time and after they made that tragic announcement, they<br>closed up there were a lot of tears and sadness.<br>(U) Years later I met his brother Bobby Kennedy, just a few days<br>before he was shot and killed as well. It was at a business meeting<br>in Indiana as he was campaigning for the Presidency; he shook<br>hands with all of us and asked where we were from. That very<br>weekend when I returned home to Los Angeles, he was shot in the<br>kitchen of the Roosevelt Hotel, not ten miles from where I was<br>living.<br>(U) Charles de Gaulle was the President of France during this time<br>and you could always tell whenever he was on the move.

This was also during the end<br>of the Algerian war and there were often open gun battles on the<br>streets of Paris between the gendarmes and Algerians. There were<br>many times that we were restricted to base and the city put offlimits.<br>(U) My last view of history was meeting the last surviving five star<br>general, Omar Bradley, when he attended a division celebration for<br>the 82d Airborne, where I was assigned.
