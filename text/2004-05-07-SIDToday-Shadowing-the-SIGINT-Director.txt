Spending<br>the day with MG Quirk was an inspiring and eye-opening experience. Collaboration, flexibility,<br>and communications were the key essential elements of every meeting I attended. I will<br>expound on a few of the meetings, to give you a sense of the day's activities.<br>(U//FOUO) The financial execution meeting with <br>and SID Leadership covered the<br>hard work involved in developing plans to meet the accelerated obligation and outlay rates. The<br>hard work and dedication to meet execution expectations resulted in very little money pulled<br>from Expenditure Centers to fund shortfalls. Executing funds is just as important as receiving<br>them.<br>(S) Another interesting meeting involved a briefing from a joint partnership between NSA and<br>CIA. Listening to the challenges and success stories of hard working civilian and military<br>personnel on the ground with military forces in Iraq was captivating. We don't hear about them<br>on the news, but they are there in the shadows producing SIGINT for commanders. Personnel in<br>the field appreciate our support and quick response to their requirements. We are definitely one<br>of the critical lifelines to the war fighter.<br>(S) The final meeting I will expound on was a senior level all-hands meeting that included<br>military and civilian leadership from across the enterprise. They discussed military field<br>command problems with timely SIGINT delivery and database access. Today, some brigade-level<br>SIGINTers are experiencing difficulties accessing critical SIGINT because of antiquated<br>processes, databases, and network infrastructure. The problem was not solved during the<br>session, but the right people took away actions to help generate a prompt suitable solution.<br>(U//FOUO) The shadowing program is an excellent opportunity to see leadership in action and<br>learn how your contribution fits into the grand scheme. I want to personally thank MG Quirk,<br>, <br>, Lt Col<br> and TSgt <br> for their hospitality and making me feel like a part of<br>the team.<br>(U) I had a great time!!!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
