DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) The Reporting Board - What Can It Do for You?<br>FROM:<br>The Reporting Board (S12A)<br>Run Date: 08/25/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) Yesterday's story gave an overview of the Reporting Board. Here's more about their<br>products and services:<br>(U//FOUO) What can we do for you?<br>(U//FOUO) The RB maintains The Reporting Page ; "go reporting" in your browser will take<br>you to the one-stop shop for all your reporting needs. The Feedback button on this page enables<br>you to inform the board of any shortage in that shop. This page contains, among other working<br>aids:<br>a Guide to SIGINT Products and Services ,<br>Report Coordination ,<br>Correcting SIGINT Reports ,<br>Write-To-Release ,<br>Guide to Foreign Release ,<br>TELIRs, etc.<br>The information in these handy guides is taken from formal policy guidance and, in consultation<br>with senior A&amp;P (S2) reporters, put into a more user-friendly form. Hard-copies may be ordered<br>by contacting the Reporting Board -- and if you have a suggestion for a booklet, please let us<br>know.<br>(U//FOUO) The Board also publishes the Reporting Forum , an aperiodic compilation of answers<br>to questions from reporters, explanations of policy issues, and general advice on reporting style<br>and substance. The Forum often generates still more questions, through which the Board is able<br>to get a feel for what's on the average reporter's mind, and, if the answer is not within our<br>purview, to raise the issue with the appropriate organization.<br>(U//FOUO) Another source of reporting information that the RB helps populate is the SIGDEV<br>learning portal Intelligence Reporting and Dissemination Community of Interest (unfortunately,<br>access is currently limited to certain browsers).<br>(U//FOUO) Customer Response is often called on to provide input to various conferences such as<br>the worldwide Cryptologic Support Group (CSG) conference , held in May 2004. Board members<br>put together a package of working aids for the participants and posted it on The Reporting Page<br>as well, for field representatives who weren't able to attend.<br>(U//FOUO) The Board also springs into action when a new operational initiative entails training,<br>or a shift in perspective. The seminar on Tear-Line Reporting held in Friedman in June was<br>organized by the Board, which is still answering questions generated by the presentation.<br>(Watch for the announcement of a second session of the seminar to be held in mid- to late<br>September.) Previous seminars presented by the board covered such topics as "Who Is a U.S.<br>Person?" and "Anatomy of a CIA Report." We also help organize tailored training sessions<br>requested by individual work centers on these topics, when a need is expressed. This can also be<br>arranged as part of the Board's "House Calls" initiative, in which an office asks us to review their<br>reporting for a certain period and provide feedback, both "yes, you're doing this right" and<br>suggestions for improvement. Again, these are coordinated with the Product Line and the<br>Customer Response Unified Reporting Service center for the PL.<br>(U//FOUO) Our members also act as advocates for reporters by representing Customer<br>Response in forums such as the Intelligence Community Tear-Line Working Group and the IC<br><br> </p>Report Recall Working Group. This enables us to find out what direction our IC colleagues are<br>moving in, and how Corporate and SID Policy will deal with these matters...and enable Customer<br>Response to prepare to meet the challenges that arise.<br>(U//FOUO) Any further questions?
