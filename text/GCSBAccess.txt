I edit! GCSB access

For GCSB access GCSB have given us access to their XKS deployments at IRONS AND ; a GCSB comsat site, which is rich in data for the South Pacific region. Specifically we can access both strong-
selected data and a full-take feed from this site. To query data at these sites, you must first take a briefing on NZSED7, the law that governs what GCSB can and can't do. To take this briefing, search for
'NZSED7' on iLearn. There is a multiple-choice, open-book test at the end of the briefing that you must pass (much like for HRA and USSED-SP0018 training). At the end, if you have passed, copy and paste
your results into a word document. You then need to navigate to ESS -Click 'Order from the Products and Services catalogue' -Leave the 'Category' drop down list empty -In the 'For' field type 'xkeyscore'
and click Search -Click the 'NZ Xkeyscore - Create' Form -Once you have filled the required information click 'Add to Cart' -Click 'View Cart Checkout' -Click 'Submit Request' -Choose a Protective
Marking, and type a brief summary of your request in the summary box -Click Submit, you should then receive a ticket number on screen.
