Success would follow later that summer, but<br>during the better part of that year the newspapers were full of<br>stories of these efforts, with much speculation on progress ranging<br>the spectrum from believable stories to pure fantasy.<br> <br>(C) Meanwhile, at RAF Chicksands, a large Air Force COMINT<br>collection site north of London, two young lieutenants were sore at<br>the military for putting them through jet fighter training classes.<br>The peace talks in Korea had diminished the Air Force's need for<br>fighter jocks, relegating them to "flying" large gray desks at the<br>Chicksands operations site instead. They used a number of<br>innovative ways to have themselves mustered out of their<br>obligated service so they could pursue flying careers in civilian life.<br>To that point, none had achieved success.<br>(U//FOUO) One particular adventure almost brought about the<br>success they sought. Using all of their creative imagination,<br>reportedly enhanced by a liberal application of libations at a nearby<br>pub one night, they took action to capitalize on the current wave of<br>news stories about Soviet progress in their space program.<br>(U//FOUO) They obtained from the base Motor Pool a 12-foot<br>length of sewer pipe, created a nose cone and tail fins, and welded<br>them in the appropriate spots on the sewer pipe, creating a<br>"rocket." (In those days, many people used the terms 'missile' and<br>'rocket' indiscriminately.) They painted it red and white, much as<br>they imagined a real rocket would be painted. They also enlisted a<br>young Air Force linguist to inscribe in Cyrillic something to the<br>effect that the 'rocket' belonged to a named scientific academy in<br>Moscow, and the address to which it should be "returned" if found<br>in any unusual location.<br>(U//FOUO) As far-fetched as this sounds today, in the climate of<br>1957, when space programs were still a matter of some fantasy,<br>there appeared a real opportunity to spoof many on Chicksands, if<br>the 'rocket' was given publicity in some unique manner.<br>(U//FOUO) The plot was hatched late one night, after some more<br>libation in that same pub. The two lieutenants took the 'rocket'<br>from its hiding place and toted it to the middle of the large green<br>field fronting on Chicksands Priory, where the major portion of foot<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.

In the dark of that night, they dug a hole<br>in the ground sufficient to hold the 'rocket' in an upright position,<br>and eased it into the hole. They then took the remainder of their<br>liquid refreshments up the hill and alongside the Officers Club, sat<br>and sipped their refreshments, awaiting dawn and the hoped-for<br>reaction of base personnel.<br> <br><br>12.

In SID er's View of<br>History : The<br>Adventure Continues<br>-- Evacuation from<br>Belgrade<br><br>(U//FOUO) Everything (except one factor) happened as planned.<br>The "rocket" was discovered, reported to the Air Police, the Base<br>Commander, and other leaders on base. What didn't occur<br>according to plan was the lieutenants' approach to the Base<br>Commander, acknowledging their prank before he had the time to<br>notify officials off-base. They both had fallen asleep during that<br>critical time period.<br>(U//FOUO) As it turned out, newspapers were notified; the<br>American embassy was alerted; the local police; British CID; and<br>reportedly even scientists at Wright Patterson AFB were in the<br>process of preparing to board a flight to the UK to inspect the<br>Soviet 'rocket' before anyone could correct the record.<br>(U//FOUO) It made a good news story. It also created the<br>opportunity for the Base Commander to "counsel" the lieutenants<br>in a way they likely would never forget. The story was repeated<br>throughout USAF Security Service (now AIA) circles for many<br>years.
