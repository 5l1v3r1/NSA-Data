QUANTUMTHEORY

(TS//SI//REL) Extremely powerful CNE/CND/CNA network
effects are enabled by integrating our passive and active systemsT

» Resetting connections (QUANTUMSKY)

* Redirecting targets for exploitation (QUANTUMINSERT)
=> Taking control of IRC bots (QUANTUMBOT)

= Corrupting file uploads/downloads (QUANTUMCOPPER)

(T5//SI//REL) QUANTUMTHEORY dynamically injects packets into a
target's network session to achieve CNE/CND/CNA network effects.

;i Detect: TURMOIL passive sensors detect target traffic & tip TURBINE command/control.
=> Decide: TURBINE mission logic constructs response & forwards to TAO node.

: Inject: TAO node injects response onto Internet towards target.

=• (TS//SI//REL) The propagation delay from tip-to-target determines the
success rate of the network effect. Less Latency = More Success!
