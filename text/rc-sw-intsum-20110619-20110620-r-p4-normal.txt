Mehran Naval Station in Karachi, Pakistan. These militants initiated
an attack that lasted approximately 18 hours, resulting in the
destruction of a P 3C Orion aircraft and death of 10 to 12 Pakistan
military personnel. On 1 June, heavily armed militants besieged a
remote Pakistani post in Peshawar, Khyber Agency, killing at least
one policeman. The Pakistan Army was forced to launch attack
helicopters to prevent the 40 man outpost from being overrun.

Later, on 12 June two separate suicide bombers detonated in an
area of Peshawar that is home to political offices and army housing.

The first explosion was reportedly small and used to draw in police
officials and first responders for the second bomber, who drove into
the area on a motorcycle packed with approximately 22 pounds of
explosives. This coordinated attack resulted in the 34 killed and
approximately 100 wounded (results of this attack did not specify
between civilian, military personnel, or government officials).

Though no insurgent group has taken responsibility for the attack
yet, the incident was rumored to be in retaliation for U.S. raids
against Bin Laden.

(SECRET//REL TO USA, ISAF, NATO) Analyst Assessment: Pakistan continues to suffer from the destabilizing effects of
civil unrest and international criticism in the wake of the 2 May Bin Laden raid. Key officials from U.S. and Islamabad are
undergoing reconciliation talks in an attempt to reaffirm commitments to counterterrorism operations and regain trust.
Alterations to U.S. monetary aid will be extremely sensitive for Pakistan due to their current poor economic status and
will greatly irritate the current situation. Pakistan's military will take little to no action to prevent the Taliban from
operating in Southern Pakistan along RC(SW)’s border, largely due to their focus against more volatile extremists in
Central and Northern Pakistan. The only way Pakistan will action Taliban elements in Southern Pakistan is if they feel
they are a threat to the nation's internal stability, something that current Taliban networks in Southern Pakistan are
aware of and avoid. (Philadelphia Inquirer, House Panel Votes To Slow Down U.S. Aid To Pakistan, 20110615;

Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP)

(U) The TTP formed from a number of Islamist
groups present in the Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA) in resistance to the Pakistani
State. Formed in December 2007, their ultimate
goal is to enforce their interpretation of Sharia law
and instate Islamic rule. There is no clear
leadership affiliation between the Taliban and the
TTP, although both harbor a desire to attack U.S.
troops. TTP has claimed responsibility for the 1
May 2010 failed Times Square bombing.
However, TTP still almost exclusively targets
Pakistani government and security infrastructure
within Pakistan to further their goal and forego
any pact with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
