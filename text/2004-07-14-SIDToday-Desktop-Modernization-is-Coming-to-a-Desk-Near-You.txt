We are<br>here to give you the answers you are seeking. The complete<br>modernization of your desktop includes a lot more then you are<br>probably aware. Not only is a Windows workstation coming to your<br>desk (with Microsoft office automation tools), but all of your email<br>and personal files will be transferred, operating system and JAVA<br>upgrades will be completed, and the network to your new desktop<br>computer will be modernized.<br>(U//FOUO) That sounds like a lot, but there is still more! For<br>example, if you use ICARUS, you transition to PKI. Display-back<br>services for some UNIX legacy applications are set up. If you are a<br>linguist or reporter, you have even more transitions to anticipate.<br>These lucky folks are transitioning to the new suite of voice tools,<br>new dictionaries and a new working aid system. And most people<br>will have to make some adjustments to their existing work<br>processes to take full advantage of the new tools. Wow! It is a lot<br>to get through, but we are here to help you navigate through the<br>changes.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Desktop<br>Modernization <br>1.  Desktop<br>Modernization is<br>Coming to a Desk<br>Near You!<br>2.  The New Voice<br>Processing Tools are<br>Here!<br>3.  We are Moving to<br>NTs<br>Windows...Where,<br>Oh, Where Can Our<br>Working Aids Go?<br>4.  Where Have All the<br>Transcripts Gone?<br><br>(U//FOUO) So, when is all of this going to happen for you? S2L,<br>S2B and S2D are already in the process, and S2H, S2A and S2K<br>will be modernized over the summer. Next on the list are S2C and<br>S2F, with all the others (S2E, S2I, S2J, S2G, S2S, S31) coming<br>behind (most of S1 already has Windows workstations).<br>(U//FOUO) Check out the SID Desktop Modernization Program<br>Management Office (PMO) web page:<br>http://<br>/sublevel1/s0/s01/cto/desktop/desktop.htm<br>for more information.<br>(U//FOUO) POC: If you have questions about Desktop<br>Modernization, send an email to DL SDM_PM (NT) or<br>@nsa.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
