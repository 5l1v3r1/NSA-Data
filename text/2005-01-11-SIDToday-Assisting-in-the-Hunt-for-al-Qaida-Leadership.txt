What was I<br>getting myself into? Was I prepared for the work? The 12-hour or<br>more days? The 7-day workweeks? Who would I be living with?<br>Who would I be working with? All of these questions and hundreds<br>more were running through my head as the plane touched down.<br><br>1.  Doing SIGINT in<br>Pakistan<br>2.  The Only Game in<br>Town (part 1)<br>3.

Assisting in the Hunt<br>for al-Qa'ida<br>Leadership<br><br>Intern <br>(C)<br><br>(TS//SI) The Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) at Bagram is<br>comprised of teams from several different agencies to include NSA,<br>CIA, DIA, CENTCOM, and NGA*, and works to support Special<br>Forces targeting and operations directed against al-Qa'ida Senior<br>Leadership (AQSL) targets. My job was to serve as a geospatial<br>metadata analyst (GMA) in support of this mission. As part of this<br>duty, we were also charged with explaining SIGINT analysis to the<br>tactical forces so that they could conduct effective time-sensitive<br>operations. Never before was I able to immediately see the results<br>of my analytic efforts, and it is a very rewarding feeling to see<br>your work being used to fight anti-coalition militia or al-Qa'ida<br>fighters.<br><br>(U//FOUO) NSA team in Bagram (the author is wearing the yellow<br>helmet)<br>(U//FOUO) One of the highlights of the TDY was when DIRNSA<br>came out to visit in mid-August. While he was scheduled to be<br>there for meetings with the Commanding General and others in the<br>CENTCOM chain of command, he made it a point to stop by our<br>workspace to personally thank us for our efforts and to present us<br>with a coin.<br>(U//FOUO) Although we were not allowed off BAF unless it was to<br>go to Kabul, there were some interesting happenings. Every Friday<br>we looked forward to the bazaar, at which local vendors would<br>come in and set up shop to sell us anything from DVDs of the<br>latest American flicks, money, jewelry, carpets, or any other<br>trinket you can imagine. You could even get your picture taken on<br>a camel for $3 if you so desired. We also had "Surf n' Turf" on<br>Fridays, when the DFAC (dining facility) served your choice of<br>lobster, shrimp or crab legs and steak. It was a nice distraction<br>from the fact that you were in Afghanistan and while it wasn't 4star restaurant quality, it was always a welcomed meal.<br>(U//FOUO) There were also the camel races, an "invitation only"<br>event hosted by our Coalition friends. When I first heard of them I<br><br> </p>thought they would be racing actual camels and wondered where<br>on BAF they could actually do that! They were, unfortunately, not<br>real camels. They were plastic camels that were auctioned off to<br>the highest bidder before each race, and then betting was open to<br>any and all, much like a horse race, and they moved by the roll of<br>dice that had the color of the camel and a number of spaces to<br>move. They were a welcome break from the 12-hour workdays and<br>the fighting going on throughout the country.<br>(U//FOUO) It wasn't until 90 days later, when I was trying to fall<br>asleep on a C-17 leaving Bagram for Germany that I could answer<br>all of the questions I had back on that day in June when I arrived<br>at BAF. I felt confident that I had provided the best support I could<br>to the GWOT (Global War on Terror). It was definitely the<br>experience of a lifetime, personally and professionally. I<br>recommend that anyone considering deployment take advantage of<br>the opportunity and experience if you can. I am looking forward to<br>the day that I can go back and do it all over again!<br><br>(U) one of many "mini-mart" type gas stations that are popping up<br>along the road from Bagram to Kabul.<br><br>(U) The author at Bagram Air Field near a marker warning of<br>mines.<br>* (U) Notes: <br>DIA = Defense Intelligence Agency <br>CENTCOM = U.S. Central Command <br>NGA = National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (formerly known as<br>the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)). <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
