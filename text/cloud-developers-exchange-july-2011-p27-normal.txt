Internet/Cyber EDA - FY 11/12

• FIVE ALIVE - carry out EDA on the netflow dataset
created by TR-FSP

-	FIVE ALIVE is a bulk store of IP flow records, coupled with some
very simple analytics that summarize and visualize IP activity

-	The main challenge here is to deal with the size of the dataset;
current work in TR-FSP has revolved around looking at subsets of
the data but it would be interesting to work on the dataset as a
whole
