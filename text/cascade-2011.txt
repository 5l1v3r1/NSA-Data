Synchronize the Cryptologic Enterprise for the Cyber Security Mission

We will improve how we anticipate, identify, track and mitigate cyber threats on
government systems through new concepts of joint operations.

We will design and develop joint SIGINT-ITS systems, including common data
repositories, joint tasking and analytic systems.

We will increase operational capacity by ensuring SIGINT, ITS, and cryptologic
partner sensors interoperate seamlessly.

We will synchronize and use ITS and SIGINT capabilities and complementary
analyses to thwart cyber threats.

Enable “Effects” for Threat Mitigation

We will seek the authority to conduct a wide spectrum of Effects operations in
support of our mandates.

We will build the technical infrastructure, policy architecture and tradecraft
necessary to conduct Effects operations.

We will further integrate ITS and SIGINT authorities and operations to leverage

Principles Explained

CLASSIFICATION:

36 Security is Transparent

If security inhibits functionality, or interferes with user experience
it will be bypassed

36 Security is a right

36 Attempting to protect everybody with end-node / gateway
defenses is not feasible.

36 IT Assets should be distributed

^ We run an open market, network providers will compete to
provide access

36 Consolidated gateways creates single points of failure
36 Cost / Redundancy considerations

CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET // COMINT // REL FVEY

36 Detection before attack hits target

3§ If we wish to enable defence we must have intelligence to know
when attacks enter our national infrastructure

36 Identify Exfiltration / Command and Control

36 Some attacks will slip through or can't be seen (i.e. shaping)

36 Exploit our temporal advantage - aggressively pursue these
implants as they will communicate ‘home' for instruction

36 The Network IS your Defence

36 In some cases, in cooperation with our partners we can affect
change at the CORE of the Internet on detection:

Modify traffic routes

Silently discard malicious traffic (hygiene filtering)

Insert payload to disrupt adversaries

CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET // COMINT // REL FVEY

26 Keeping pace with the Adversary

26 From the time a malicious PDF is opened, till SEEDSPHERE has
interactive control of a workstation is <3 minutes

26 There are countless malicious actors (state, crime, generic malware)

26 Gateway / End-Node Defence by itself is insufficient
26 It is only one part of the problem

26 Over 600,000 Apps in the iTunes AppStore (How do you secure that?)

26 Defence in Depth includes network monitoring, and network interaction

26 Build better Defence

26 Our current MO is to resolve one incident at a time

26 Automate the defence through a robust network capable of not only
detection, but manipulation of malicious traffic

Changing the way we think

Tipping and Cueing

If the purpose is to enable defence of national infrastructure it becomes
unnecessary in a 5-eyes context

We have full visibility of our national infrastructure

The chance of heating’ the internet for latency of an attack is minimal

The network will perform the filtering

What if instead T&C enables intelligence collection (Cyber Session
Collection)?

Targeting and Tasking

We all share common targets and we will all target using our national capability
the cyber threats we know about

%% No need for 2nd party tasking / targeting requests. Instead expose cyber
information across the community

What if instead we focus on analytic collaboration and knowledge transfer
TEXPRO information, federated repositories (malware/traffic), etc

CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET // COMINT // REL FYEY

CLASSIFICATION:

Changing the way we think

36 Foreign SIGINT Intercept

36 Becomes the 'hunting ground’ for discovery of new threats

36 Enables attribution and counter-intelligence reporting

36 Defence is taken care of by The Network’

36 Mobile Platforms are the next frontier, what is their implication
on Cyber?

36 Domestic Defence

36 We will exhaust the treasury deploying network appliances to
perform dynamic defence

36 The same capabilities will be integrated into the CORE of the
Internet

36 Defence in Depth through complimentary capabilities on end-
nodes, at the gateway, and in the core of the Internet.

36 Cost / Redundancy considerations

CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET // COMINT // REL FVEY

36 Detection before attack hits target

36 If we wish to enable defence we must have intelligence to know
when attacks enter our national infrastructure

36 Identify Exfiltration / Command and Control

36 Some attacks will slip through or can’t be seen (i.e. shaping)

36 Exploit our temporal advantage - aggressively pursue these
implants as they will communicate ‘home’ for instruction

36 The Network IS your Defence

36 In some cases, in cooperation with our partners we can affect
change at the CORE of the Internet on detection:

Modify traffic routes

Silently discard malicious traffic (hygiene filtering)

Insert payload to disrupt adversaries

Rationale

36 Keeping pace with the Adversary

36 From the time a malicious PDF is opened, till SEEDSPHERE has
interactive control of a workstation is <3 minutes

36 There are countless malicious actors (state, crime, generic malware)

36 Gateway / End-Node Defence by itself is insufficient

36 It is only one part of the problem

36 Over 600,000 Apps in the iTunes Appstore (How do you secure that?)

36 Defence in Depth includes network monitoring, and network interaction

36 Build better Defence

36 Our current MO is to resolve one incident at a time
36 Automate the defence through a robust network capable of not only
detection, but manipulation of malicious traffic

ASSIFICATIO

What does it Mean?

36 EONBLUE will be integrated into the Network
36 Monitoring Government of Canada

36 Monitoring Core Infrastructure (Special Source) extending the
reach to view national infrastructure

36 Monitoring foreign Internet Space

36 EONBLUE will enable defensive operations

36 Through robust communication with host-based capabilities
36 Through direct manipulation of network communications
36 Through interaction with Teleco infrastructure to affect change

96 Tipping and Cueing

36 If the purpose is to enable defence of national infrastructure it becomes
unnecessary in a 5-eyes context

Wc have full visibility of our national infrastructure

The chance of'beating' the internet for latency of an attack is minimal

The network will perform the filtering

96 What if instead T&C enables intelligence collection (Cyber Session
Collection)?

96 Targeting and Tasking

96 We all share common targets and we will all target using our national capability
the cyber threats we know about

96 No need for 2ml party tasking / targeting requests. Instead expose cyber
information across the community

96 What if instead we focus on analytic collaboration and knowledge transfer
TEXPRO information, federated repositories (malwarc/traffic), etc

Changing the way we think

36 Foreign SIGINT Intercept

36 Becomes the ‘hunting ground’ for discovery of new threats

36 Enables attribution and counter-intelligence reporting

36 Defence is taken care of by ‘The Network’

36 Mobile Platforms are the next frontier, what is their implication
on Cyber?

36 Domestic Defence

36 We will exhaust the treasury deploying network appliances to
perform dynamic defence

36 The same capabilities will be integrated into the CORE of the
Internet

36 Defence in Depth through complimentary capabilities on end-
nodes, at the gateway, and in the core of the Internet.
