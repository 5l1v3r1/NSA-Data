It will<br>provide tips for writing better reports.<br>(U) If you want to provide hours of entertainment for your<br>colleagues, just run spell-check on your composition (be it a<br>product report, memo, agency-all announcement -- anything with<br>a broad audience) and then send it out without a final<br>proofreading. NSANet's bandwidth use will spike as your writing is<br>clipped and forwarded around the world with comments like "I<br>should think they would be 'Sorry for the incontinence'!" (That<br>one's a classic, and still occurs from time to time.) Product reports<br>that describe provincial governments building a bride, ministers<br>making sure their constituents get the massage, alerts to failed<br>assignation attempts, vacancy announcements that call for<br>personnel with duel skill sets...who doesn't have folders full of<br>these goofs?<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Write Right '04 <br>1.

Write Right : Is That<br>Adjective or Adverb<br>Really Necessary?<br><br>(U) But seriously, folks, unintended humor isn't the only<br>consequence of overreliance on your spell-checker. We have in our<br>files an executive weekly highlights in which all the POC lines<br>contain common nouns, because someone kept hitting the spellchecker's "Correct" button withÂ​out looking. We also have product<br>reports that give the opposite impression of what was intended,<br>because "now" was substituted for "not," and "viz." for "vice." As<br>Mark Twain said, the difference between the right word and the<br>almost right word is the difference between lightning and lightning<br>bug.<br>(U) Granted, once you've rewritten a piece several times, it's<br>harder and harder to proofread it, and when your eye catches no<br>misspelled words (because you've used that handy tool), it's easy<br>to relax and hit Send . Make a deal with your co-workers; you'll<br>cast a final eye over their writing if they'll do the same for you.<br>Avoid inclusion in the NSA bloopers e-mail alias!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
