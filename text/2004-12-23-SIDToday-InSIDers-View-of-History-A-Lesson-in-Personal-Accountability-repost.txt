A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br>(repost)<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>(former) SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 12/23/2004<br><br>Note from SIGINT Communications: It's that time of year when SID today presents its "best of"<br>articles for the year that's coming to a close. We'll start the ball rolling with this article from<br>January 2004... (U)<br>(C) In the winter of 1995-96, I was deployed to Italy in support of our Balkans effort known as<br>OPERATION JOINT ENDEAVOR. I was the deputy C-2 of the Combined Air Operations Center<br>(CAOC) in Vicenza. One of my many, many duties was to oversee the preparation of target<br>packages for contingency bombing as American tanks crossed the river into Bosnia. My staff and<br>I diligently prepared these packages, which consisted mainly of imagery packages with<br>Designated Mean Point of Impact (DMPIs - pronounced 'dimpy' by the Air Force guys). Our job<br>was to select targets from all three factions at the time (Serb, Croatian and Muslim) that<br>represented a range of options for the CINC, from show of force through harassment to major<br>destruction.<br>(C) Due to the uncertainty of resistance to the ground effort, the CINC (we call them<br>"Combatant Commanders" now) wanted to have a total package in his hip pocket if he had to<br>attack. There had been some mistakes made in previous bombings (with civilian losses) and an<br>F-16 had been shot down so the packages had to be checked and rechecked with the<br>weaponeers and operational planners. After a LOT of work we had a good set of target packages<br>for the CINC.<br>(C) One day, the CINC (General Ryan - future Chief of Staff of the Air Force) showed up<br>unannounced at my door. After I recovered from the shock of seeing all those stars in my<br>doorway, I asked him how I could help him. He said he wanted to review the target packages.<br>Since there were over 100 of them, I selected about ten for him to spot check (I assumed he<br>was a busy guy). He sat right down and began his review. He pored over the photos and asked<br>about the DMPIs. After an explanation he said, "I approve all the DMPIs, now give me the next<br>set." I said that he didn't have to review them all since it was my job to do this for him since he<br>is busy, etc. If you know General Ryan at all, you will not be surprised by his immediate<br>reaction.<br>(C) As I was put at the position of attention, I was given a lesson in personal responsibility. The<br>CINC explained that warfare had made a fundamental change - that commanders had a legal<br>responsibility in the war crimes sense. If a mistake is made, there was the real possibility of a<br>war crimes charge in the climate of the Balkans war. The CINC was bound and determined that<br>no one below him would be responsible. So he wanted to personally approve every DMPI. It<br>became a long day and a learning experience for me. It really brought home the concepts of<br>responsibility and accountability.<br>(S//SI) For us today this lesson is especially important. The planning cycle for dropping a bomb<br>has compressed from a day to minutes and the criterion for the aiming point has less and less<br>review. As many of you know, our forces in Iraq are dropping bombs on the strength of SIGINT<br>alone. We are proud of their confidence in us, but have you ever considered the enormous risk<br>the commanders are assuming in this regard? Are you ready to share that risk? Makes you think<br>about how critical your best efforts are.<br>(C) Keep in mind the awesome responsibility we have to do quality work fast. In the past we<br>may have traded quality for speed. That equation doesn't hold any more. We are in the business<br>of saving lives and we mainly think of it as alerting the good guys to the bad guys and targeting<br>them, but it also means being aware of the location of the good guys (to prevent fratricide) and<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">more and more an awareness of the non-combatants (to prevent the tragedy of killing the<br>innocents). Ask yourself this question: Am I doing my very best? Our success and their lives<br>depend on the answer.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
