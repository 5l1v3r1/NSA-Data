DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Target Templating - The Way Ahead<br>FROM: SIGINT Development - Strategy and Governance (SSG)<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 11/24/2004<br><br>(C) What does it mean to be a SIGINT Hunter? How can we efficiently use multiple analytic and<br>signal exploitation techniques to create a coherent picture of target activity? How can we<br>systematically determine our knowledge gaps? How can a virtual team of S1, S2, S3, NSOC and<br>Cryptologic Partners keep the SIGINT system agile by jointly developing a Target Template that<br>automatically updates itself with the latest information and activity of a target? These are just<br>some of the questions SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is addressing in its<br>Target Templating Implementation Strategy .<br>(S//SI) The SIGINT Enterprise Strategy, FY-03-08 (SID Placement), Objective 2.2, directs the<br>SIGINT system to "isolate critical intelligence within the target's information space by applying<br>the target templating process" and to "work collaboratively, assemble a coherent target<br>template (or thread) that spans across all forms of communication, all data collected, all forensic<br>analysis of data, and all previous analysis of the target". Since such a comprehensive set of data<br>could only be produced using a variety of analytic techniques, Templating should not be seen as<br>an additional analytic technique, but a unifying framework for analysis and analytic<br>techniques .<br>(S//SI) For this reason, Target Templating Leads within SSG work with the Social Network<br>Analysis Workcenter to merge social network analysis, communications event analysis and other<br>analytic techniques into the Templating process. These ongoing relationships help SSG to<br>understand how Templating is perceived, what works and doesn't work in applying the<br>Templating methodology and how to make it easier to merge analytic approaches, techniques<br>and tools in order to make Templating more effective as a unifying framework for SIGINT<br>Development. This framework is being realized by simultaneously addressing four distinct<br>courses of action or vectors of the Templating Implementation Strategy.<br><br>(S//SI) The first vector is Enabling Technology . One part of this vector will address how to<br>integrate information from the KSP (Knowledge System Prototype) to visualize and<br>automatically update a Target Template. A second part of this vector will provide an interim<br>Target Templating tool for capturing and modeling Target Templates.<br>(U) The second vector in the Target Templating Implementation Strategy is Skill Development<br>. In this vector, SSG is working with the National Cryptologic School, NETA 3001, the SID<br>Analyst Boot Camp and the SIGDEV Learning Portal to produce videos, briefings and course<br>materials that contain a consistent message of what Target Templating is and how to effectively<br>use it.<br>(S) The third vector of the Implementation Strategy is Product Line/IMT Partnerships . In<br>this vector, SSG is developing Target Templating POCs within Product Lines and is consulting<br>with analysts in SSIO, OPAC, ICN*, the Global Network Development Activity (GNDA), and other<br>groups to apply Templating to specific Information Needs and target problems. SSG works with<br>Issue Management Teams (IMTs) to apply the Target Templating process, which complements<br>and supports the SID Operating Principles . For example, SSG and the Combating Proliferation<br>IMT have worked together on numerous activities to bring Templating into the IMT's daily focus.<br>(U) The fourth vector of the Implementation Strategy is Process Integration . SSG recognizes<br>that Templating, as an end-to-end SIGINT process, involves many organizations and individuals.<br>SSG Target Templating Leads work with a variety of Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), working<br>groups and organizations to understand the goals of these groups and how Templating can<br><br> </p>contribute.<br>(U) In the next article, we will focus in on what is happening in the Enabling Technology vector<br>to bring tools to Templating.
