Global War on Terrorism -- including Counterterrorism,
Homeland Security and aspects of Countering Proliferation,
Crime and Narcotics, Information Operations, and other
missions.
Bin 2 : 35% of USSS resources cover four enduring
targets : China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia.
Bin 3 : 20% of USSS resources are aimed toward
optimizing efforts in the remaining strategic focus areas
, while maintaining awareness of -- and surge capabilities
against -- other targets.
Bin 4 : 10% of USSS resources are set aside for
development in the areas of Data Acquisition, Signals
Development, or Analysis and Production. This bin affords
Site Commanders and Cryptologic Center Chiefs the
opportunity to operate outside their usual parameters, using
their special skill sets to develop other target areas or
provide local support to the Combatant Commander.
