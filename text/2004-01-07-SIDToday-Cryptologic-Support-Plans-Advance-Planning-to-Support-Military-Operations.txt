One of the ways we do this is by drawing up<br>Cryptologic Support Plans (CSPs), each tailored for a potential military operation. For example, a<br>series of CSPs has been developed for the Iraq conflict and is being maintained as operations<br>there continue; CSPs are also underway for Korea, the Horn of Africa, and the Global War on<br>Terrorism.<br>(U//FOUO) The intended audience of the CSP is twofold: cryptologic representatives at the<br>various Combatant Commands, who explain to military commanders how NSA will provide<br>SIGINT and information assurance support to their particular operations; and, secondly, the NSA<br>leadership, who are informed about how relevant players within the Extended Enterprise are<br>committing their resources to the problem at hand. A critical purpose of these CSPs is not only<br>to provide a detailed description of what NSA can and will do in support of military operations,<br>but also - and often as important - to clarify what NSA cannot do. This helps to manage the<br>command's expectations and has been quite influential in military planning for recent<br>operations.<br>(U//FOUO) CSPs describe the NSA/CSS concept of cryptologic support to a specific military<br>Operations Plan (OPLAN) or Concept Plan (CONPLAN) developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or<br>by one of the military Combatant Commands. Plans officers in the Customer Relationships<br>Directorate's Military Integration Office maintain continuous contact with NSA representatives in<br>the Combatant Command Cryptologic Service Groups (CSGs), J2 (Intelligence Directorate) staff<br>members, collection managers and others involved in the planning process. Once they are<br>notified that a planning process is underway, the plans officers begin to build a comprehensive<br>description of that OPLAN or CONPLAN for the NSA audience. Simultaneously, they gather<br>information that is immediately available from the target offices of primary interest, collection<br>management offices, Service Cryptologic Elements (SCE) and a host of other sources in the form<br>of posture papers or strategies for collection and reporting in the geographic area of interest. All<br>of this information is factored into the resulting CSP.<br>(U//FOUO) The process leading to a completed CSP is further enhanced by synchronization<br>sessions known as Operational Planning Team (OPT) meetings, with participation by<br>representatives from all relevant offices in SID and IAD. The OPT provides for two-way<br>communication through the office representatives between military planners and technical<br>experts, collectors, analysts, managers, and others. The CSP may be continuously maintained<br>for ongoing campaigns, or developed as a reference for OPLANS and CONPLANS as they are<br>revised on a biennial cycle.<br>(U//FOUO) Visit our webpage or contact our office on <br>and support to military operations.<br><br> for more information on CSPs<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
