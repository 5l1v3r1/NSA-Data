VALIDATOR

VALIDATOR is a part of a backdoor access system under the FOXACID project. The
VALIDATOR is a client/server-based system that provides unique backdoor access to
personal computers of targets of national interest, including but not limited to terrorist
targets. VALIDATOR is a small Trojan implant used as a back door against a variety of
targeted Windows systems, which can be deployed remotely or via hands on access to
any Windows box from Windows 98 through Windows Server 2003. The LP is on-line
24/7 and tasking is ‘queued’, that is, jobs sit in a queue waiting for the target to ‘call
home’, then the job(s) are sent one at a time to the target for it to process them.
Commands are Put a file, get a file, Put, then execute a file, get system information,
change VALIDATOR ID, and Remove itself. VALIDATOR’S are deployed to targeted
systems and contact their Listening Post (LP) (each VALIDATOR is given a specific
unique ID, specific IP address to call home to it’s LP); SEPI analysts validate the target’s
identity and location (USSID-18 check), then provide a deployment list to Olympus
operators to load a more sophisticated Trojan implant (currently OLYMPUS, future
UNITEDRAKE). An OLYMPUS operator then queue up commands for the specific
VALIDATOR ID’s given by SEPI. Process repeats itself. Once target is hooked with the
more sophisticated implant, VALIDATOR operators tend to cease. On occasion,
operators are instructed by SEPI or the SWO to have VAIDATOR delete itself.
