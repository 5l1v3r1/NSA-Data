Chavez is a throwback to the Cold War Era; he is an<br>ardent admirer and supporter of Cold War dinosaur Fidel Castro,<br>whom Chavez views as his mentor.<br>(S//REL) Following in his mentor's footsteps, Chavez is virulently<br>anti-U.S. and is actively seeking to end the oil relationship<br>between the two countries, and to pursue any course of action he<br>believes will have a negative impact on the United States. The<br>Administration has tasked the Intelligence Community with<br>improving our capabilities vis-Ãƒ -vis Venezuela to enhance<br>policymakers' understanding of the Chavez regime's plans and<br>intentions so that policymakers can develop a means for countering<br>them.<br>(S) Having centralized control over the government and military<br>and weakened opposition groups to the point that they are<br>incapable of offering a viable alternative to his regime, Chavez is<br>focusing his efforts on exporting his Bolivarian Revolution** to<br>neighboring countries, casting the United States in the role of<br>imperial exploiter of Latin America and seeking to create regional<br>trade and security blocs that would exclude the United States.<br>(S) Other democratic nations in Latin America are concerned that<br>his efforts to develop and strengthen ties to insurgent and populist<br>groups in the region could lead to civil unrest and that his anti-free<br>market policies could impact negatively on their economies. Chavez<br>also is reaching out to countries of enduring concern to the United<br>States, particularly China, Iran, and Russia, to develop ties and<br>further cooperation as another means of pursuing his anti-U.S.<br>strategy.<br>(S) In addition to threatening democratic institutions in the region,<br>Chavez is working to limit Venezuela's dependency on the United<br>States to purchase Venezuelan oil. The high sulphur content of the<br>oil requires specialized processing and most of the refineries<br>capable of handling this crude are in the United States. Although<br>there is an element of the impractical in Chavez' desire to reduce<br>oil deliveries to the United States, since Venezuela is the fourth<br>largest supplier of oil to the United States any threat to cut off that<br>supply is one that needs to be taken seriously.<br>(S//SI//REL) From a SIGINT perspective, Venezuela poses a<br>particularly difficult challenge.
