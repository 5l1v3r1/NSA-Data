Streight<br>Run Date: 01/05/2004<br>FROM: Lynda B. Streight <br>(U//FOUO) Upon my retirement, I would like to say farewell to everyone in SID and I would like<br>to introduce the new SID Workforce Performance Management Executive,<br>First, to everyone in SID, a thank you for your support, for your suggestions, for being you. You<br>are the heart and soul of this Agency; the work you do keeps America and the world free.<br>Always be proud of it.<br>(U//FOUO) I believe we have come a long way and accomplished a lot for the people of SID since<br>SID was formed in February 2001. In the Performance Management area we have:<br>instituted important P3 guidelines and instilled the importance of P3s in the entire<br>compensation process. There are now mandatory P3 criteria for seniors and managers; Senior<br>P3s are posted to the web so everyone can cascade down from them; and we have guidance to<br>keep P3 scores honest and reasonable and not inflated.<br>developed a promotion process that puts decisions in the hands of the managers closest to the<br>individuals; we now have management-driven decisions at the lowest level possible without<br>fairsharing. The process is posted for all to see.<br>fought for SID's share of the dollars. We work constantly with HRS on the allocations to make<br>sure that SID does not slide backwards with its allocations.<br>allocated the promotion money by Agency and SID areas of emphasis, rather than fair-shared<br>by a complicated formula of time-in-grade and numbers of people in-grade, etc. SID believes<br>that promotions should go to those most deserving; if the money is fairshared this cannot<br>happen.<br>received more money than in past years because we developed a logical argument that we<br>took to the Director and in turn received additional promotion and awards dollars for the last<br>cycle.<br>emphasized feedback, not just at P3 and promotion time, but throughout the year. We have<br>worked with, and will continue to work with, ADET and HRS to develop management leadership<br>training which will include feedback training.<br>put all information on the web for all to see. We developed many guides for the processes, for<br>feedback, for timelines, and many other areas of importance to SID.<br>communicated with the work force through the web, SID-alls, and answering individual<br>questions and emails. Communication is the key and we will continue to emphasize that.<br>(U//FOUO)<br>will continue working all the these efforts and will continue to fight<br>for the SID people. Before taking this job he was the Agency hiring manager, so he is very<br>familiar with many aspects of SID. He has a great background for this work and will have many<br>great ideas for doing things even better for all of you. Please welcome him and encourage him<br>with support and ideas.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
