Contact-chaining research is all about starting with a known set of targets
(usually comms identifiers), and then looking at the data surrounding them to
learn more or discover interesting new targets.

B17 have been doing research on this topic for at least 8 years!

The main themes of our contact-chaining work are:

-Scoring, not just filtering - CARPAT is a filtering tool, it takes bulk data and
filters to get the n/w surrounding targets. However, these networks can still be
pretty big, and will get bigger as data volumes continue to grow. We think it is
going to be important to be able to score nodes in these networks, so that users
can home in on the most important bits

-Another important factor is combining together different algorithms and data
sources without confusing the user.

-We also think it is important to develop CC algorithms specifically for CC as
our recent experience is that taking an algorithm designed for telephony
analysis and just porting to C2C data does not work very well. The reasons for
this are:...

-Finally, we think it is important to make contact-chaining tools question-based
and interactive. For example, one of the problems with many tools is that they
present you will a whole load of configurable options and parameters, which
can overwhelm the user. We think we should move to a situation where the user
can ask a specific analysis questions of the tool - for example “who are the
most strongly connected email addresses to this set of targets” or “what are the
links between these two groups of targets?”. The tool presents the best answers
it can, allowing the user to interact with the results, drilling-down on detail, in
a similar way to IMMINGLE.

I mentioned combining of scores.

Good example is a telephony prototype, SF, developed between GCHQ and
R62 at NSA	GCHQ integree there)

SORTING FRIENDS takes a large number of tel call records (e.g we’ve been
running it on the A24 datamart) and reduces it down to all sorts of different
relationships between phone numbers. The aim is to try and use lots of
different measures of strength of relationship to get closer to the real social
relationship.

Describe patterns

Then there is a clustering and visualisation step.

Currently SF is very much a research prototype, and Lorraine in SD can run it
for large projects in Ops. Much work needed on it, we don’t think it will be a
pulled-through on its own, but rather will be part of CHART BREAKER.

Mentioned problem of not being able to represent full complexity of C2C
events as a graph... Here’s an example of a full network... emails and other
things such as PSOUP score and timing pattern.

We think the key to this is to collapse down to edges, but with weights on those
edges that measure how strong a relationship there is.

So the full network reduces to this graph - blue timing pattern, black sender-to-
receiver, red relationship between 2 recipients, and green PSOUP.

Trick is to get the edge weights right - at the moment we’re working on
algorithms that can do this for all the relationships in email (sender-to-receiver,
receiver-to-receiver, event sender-to-sender).

Also looking at timing analysis for C2C.

Where you have multiple types of relationship between people, you can also
calculate a total score.

Contact-chaining, problem 3:
Scoring nodes

After you have edge scores, you can use these to score nodes, to answer
specific questions.

For example, in CHART BREAKER we have developed a new scoring
technique that scores non-targets according to how strong the relationship is to
a small group of targets... as shown here. This allows you to rank non-targets
by suspiciousness. The algorithm uses a technique that gives targets a weight
and sort of iteratively distributes it down the links to connected nodes over a
number of iterations, (not just to first circle nodes). We want to develop similar
algorithms for other questions. Node scoring algorithms may be independent of
whether telephony or C2C due to the edge scoring stage.

This is where you include pre-calculated scores that concern nodes themselves
- for example, offers@ has a spam score, which lowers score in answer to the
question. The scores allow you to rank nodes according to how well they
answer the question, and only show the top 5 scores.

We think the visualisation will be key to using contact-chaining algorithm.

We think it is important for the prototype to be able to show multiple views of
the data....

Also, descriptions of “why”

For this reason, we’ve started some work on using MAMBA to visualise the
results of contact chaining algorithms

we know what we the scores are.
