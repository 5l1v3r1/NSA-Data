(repost)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/29/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>Unknown <br>(U//FOUO) There are many different professions at work within SID, and each speaks its own<br>specialized "language". Once a person becomes accustomed to hearing the jargon, it becomes<br>second nature -- but an outsider sitting in on a typical SID meeting would likely have no idea<br>what's going on! We thought it would be interesting to document some of this "SID jargon" -we'll start by looking at the vocabulary of one of the core SIGINT professions: transcription.<br>(U//FOUO) Transcription is sometimes confused with translation. What's the difference? A<br>translator takes text in one language and converts it into another. Transcription, on the other<br>hand, is when one listens to speech and writes down -- in the original language -- what was<br>said.** Sounds easy? It isn't! Aside from the fact that the sound quality may not be the<br>greatest, there's the need to be proficient in a foreign language, not to mention that the<br>speakers may have dialects, quirks of speech, use unfamiliar slang, etc.<br>(C//SI) Here's a list of commonly used transcription terms. It may give some insight into what<br>it's like to be a transcriber (or "scribe" for short):<br>"foot pedal" : a device used to allow the scribe to back up, play, fast forward, etc. a<br>recording using his feet, thereby freeing up the hands for typing.<br>"rock on it" : the act of listening to a certain garbled word over and over to try to figure out<br>what is being said.<br>"A%" (called A-validity or simply A-val): a "reliability indicator" that shows how certain the<br>transcriber is that the text is accurate. A% means "certain"; B% is used with "numbers, words,<br>or phrases that are audibly questionable to the transcriber but otherwise bona fide." (In other<br>words, probably accurate.) C% is "the phonetic rendition of words or phrases that cannot be<br>found in available reference materials." [Quotes taken from USSID 101, Annex C.] In a<br>transcript, such a term might appear something like this: "Mr. Smith(B%) said he was the<br>director of the newly-formed company."<br>"read" (or readability) : this is a scale indicating how clear a recording is. A read of 1<br>indicates that there is nothing intelligible. A read of 5 (the highest, called "5-by") means nearperfect audio quality. You might hear a scribe say, "This read of 2 is terrible! I can only pick out<br>a word here and there!"<br>"a cut" : a recorded conversation. "There was nothing to report on the first three cuts, but<br>the reporters will want us to work on the fourth cut asap, as a VIP was speaking!"<br>"voice id" : when a scribe knows a speaker's voice so well that he can identify the person on<br>that basis alone. "The caller didn't say his name, but the senior scribe knew the voice well<br>enough to do a voice id on the person: it was Mr. Jones."<br>"ears" : a scribe's earphones. "Put on your ears and come listen to this cut."<br>"ui fem" : an unidentified female. "A ui fem came on the line and asked to speak to the<br>operator." The counterpart to this is "ui male".<br>"scan" : to listen quickly through a recording to determine whether or not it merits<br>transcription.<br><br> </p>"a gist" : when a scribe summarizes in English what was said in a conversation. "It was very<br>long and complicated, so I did a gist to explain what was happening."<br>"qc" : quality control. An experienced scribe usually qc's the work of a beginner to check for<br>accuracy.<br>"ntr" : nothing to report.<br>"1-2G" : one or two words are garbled. "XG" means an indeterminate number of words are<br>garbled. Likewise, "1-2M" means "1 or 2 words missing."<br>"reverse dictionary" : a working aid that lists the words of a language alphabetically starting<br>with the last letter and working towards the first letter. (So in the Latin alphabet, words ending<br>in "a"- rather than those starting with "a" - would be at the front of the reverse dictionary.) This<br>is used when the first part of a word is garbled or indistinct, but the end is clear. Let's say a<br>scribe hears "....partment". He can refer to the reverse dictionary to search for a word that<br>would make sense in the context of the sentence (e.g. com partment, de partment, etc.)<br>"perschat" : personal chatter (i.e. talk that is not business-related, and therefore of no<br>interest).<br>**(U) Note: A third variant is interpreting, which is speech-to-speech.<br>(U) This is a slightly modified version of an article that first appeared in December 2003.
