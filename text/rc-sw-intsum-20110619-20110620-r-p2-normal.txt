EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

API

(u) Pakistan Alter the UBLBaid; Status of UJ. Relations and Internal Strife

(SECRET//RELTO USA, ISAF, NATO)

•	Pakistan continues to suffer from the destabilizing affects of civil unrest and international criticism in the
wake of the 2 May Bin Laden raid.

•	In addition to strained U.S. relations, Pakistan is experiencing a strong backlash from extremist organizations
who feel the Government of Pakistan is weak and complicit with Western Powers.

(SECRET//REL TO USA, ISAF, NATO) Analyst Assessment: Pakistan continues to suffer from the destabilizing affects of
civil unrest and international criticism in the wake of the 2 May Bin Laden raid. Key officials from U.S. and Islamabad are
undergoing reconciliation talks in an attempt to reaffirm commitments to counterterrorism operations and regain trust.
Alterations to U.S. monetary aid will be extremely sensitive for Pakistan due to their current poor economic status and
will greatly irritate the current situation. Pakistan's military will take little to no action to prevent the Taliban from
operating in Southern Pakistan along RC(SW)'s border, largely due to their focus against more volatile extremists in
Central and Northern Pakistan. The only way Pakistan will action Taliban elements in Southern Pakistan is if they feel
they are a threat to the nation's internal stability, something that current Taliban networks in Southern Pakistan are
aware of and avoid.

FQCUS QN THE ENEMY

(u) The Safean Area of Lashkar Gah Muniuaal Center

(SECRET//RELTO USA, ISAF, NATO)

•	The Safean area of Lashkar Gah is exploited by insurgents due to its lawlessness, lack of GIRoA influence, and
value to the insurgency by being close to the Municipal Center (MC).

•	Insurgent commanders and fighters have utilized Safean to stage for Close Quarters Attacks (CQA) and to
conduct planning, coordination, and staging for Suicide IED (SIED) attacks against the MC.

(SECRET//REL TO USA, ISAF, NATO) Analyst Assessment: As the Lashkar Gah security transition approaches, Safean will
likely be a key area that insurgents will try to exploit in order to retain access to the MC for executing attacks. However,
extending development projects and GIRoA presence into the Safean area would have a positive, lasting effect on local
nationals' support for GIRoA, which would essentially degrade the Taliban's ability to utilize the area for attack planning
and staging.

FOCUS ON THE POPULATION

(U) The District Community Council and Voter Registration Impact in Garm Ser District

(SECRET//RELTO USA, ISAF, NATO)

•	The Garm Ser District Community Council (DCC) will expand to represent the entire district.

•	District Executive Officer (DEO) organized a successful voter registration drive.

•	The DCC elections will be held on 22 June, offering a chance to solidify this spring’s gains and tie Southern
Garm Ser firmly to GIRoA.
