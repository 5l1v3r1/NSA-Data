Who determines what kind of<br>munitions you need to penetrate a given facility? How are underground facilities constructed,<br>and how do you determine what they are used for? Who inspects chemical weapons storage<br>facilities?<br>(U//FOUO) All these responsibilities belong to DTRA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.<br>DTRA was created in October 1998 by consolidating several DoD elements: Defense Special<br>Weapons Agency, Defense Technical Security Agency, and On-Site Inspection Agency. DTRA's<br>mission is to "safeguard the United States and its friends from weapons of mass destruction by<br>reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat. DTRA's work covers a broad<br>spectrum of activities - shaping the international environment to prevent the spread of weapons<br>of mass destruction (WMD), responding to military requirements to help the United States<br>deter, withstand, prevail against and recover from the use of such weapons, and preparing the<br>warfighter to counter the full spectrum of future WMD threats." (See their webpage on Intelink.)<br>(TS//SI) The SID Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM), Joe Brand, and the Account<br>Manager (AM), <br>, continue to meet with the DTRA directorates and expose them to the<br>value of SIGINT. Since 9/11 the SEAM/AM have worked closely with DTRA to ensure that NSA<br>has received their Intelligence Needs and that we are responding to them with timely products<br>and services. They have visited the Hard Target Research and Analysis Center, a collaborative<br>effort between DTRA and the DCI's Underground Facilities Analysis Center; the<br>Chemical/Biological Defense Directorate; and the Technology Development Directorate. They are<br>facilitating analytic exchanges between DTRA and NSA analysts on lessons learned in Operation<br>Iraqi Freedom, and regularly meet with DTRA's Security and Counterintelligence Directorate<br>(SCI) to keep them apprised of developments in SIGINT dissemination, support, and activities.<br>(U//FOUO) DTRA has been so pleased with NSA's intelligence support that they asked the SID<br>SEAM to brief the DTRA Threat Reduction Advisory Committee, which advises the DTRA Director,<br>the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Secretary of<br>Defense. Our interaction with DTRA was hailed as the model of tailored intelligence<br>support and one that DTRA would like to see all other intelligence agencies follow!<br>(S) Last February, the Account Manager briefed DTRA's monthly intelligence forum, comprised of<br>intelligence analysts from each of the DTRA directorates, to engage these analysts in a more<br>interactive role with NSA. Following this meeting, DTRA personnel approached the AM and asked<br>to visit NSA to learn more about our capabilities. They also offered to brief NSA analysts on<br>some development efforts in which they are engaged concerning threat anticipation, based on<br>open source information, and initiatives under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.<br>(U//FOUO) We are working to increase DTRA's interaction with NSA analysts. We encourage you<br>to highlight areas in which DTRA assistance would be valuable. There's a wealth of knowledge<br>waiting to be shared. If you see areas where interaction would be valuable, contact the AM for<br>DTRA <br>,<br>@nsa) or the SEAM, <br> (<br>@nsa).<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
