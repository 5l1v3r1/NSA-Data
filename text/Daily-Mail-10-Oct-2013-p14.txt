Marxist, who wanted to smash all the

traditions and institutions which make
Britain British, could be said to love
his countr

By iany objective yardstick, don’t such
crimes and controversies pale beside the
accusation levelled against the Guardian
on Tuesday by the new head of MI5?

Indeed, it is impossible to imagine a
graver charge against a newspaper than
that it has given succour to our country's
enemies and endangered all our lives by
handing terrorists ‘the gift they need to

evade us and strike at wSr.

Yet so said Andrew Parker, in his first
speech as our spy chief, which yesterday
was significantly endorsed by NolO.

So isn’t it staggering that the BBC, after
spending all last week trumpeting
Ed Miliband's attack on this paper over
charge that his father's Marxist
validated one of the most evil

their demands for the power to detain
suspects without trial for 90 days.

We led the charge against MIS's cosiness
with Labour over the dodgy dossier o:

Iraq. And we have opposed secret courts
and the so-called snoopers’ charter.

But at the same time, we accept

that the security services would be
guilty of dereliction of duty if they failed
to monitor those who pose a threat to

the UK.

And we have always argued that a line
needs to be drawn between the civil
liberties we treasure and the interests of
national security.

We believe the Guardian, with lethal
irresponsibility, has crossed that line by
printing tens of thousands of words

the paper has ‘already done reai damage’,
while the information it still holds is likely

reticence, the editor of the Guardian now
says he will continue to release the
material, arguing that he will take care to
publish nothing that endangers lives.

But how, in the name of sanity, can he
know? He’s a journalist, not an expert
on security.

As for his paper’s att ack on us over the

True, he hated so much about this
country that he wanted a workers’

with Churchill’s during the Cold War.

Nor was he ever accused by the head of

lives at risk.
