• This process replaces process_dataO through process_dataX

■	The “parent" process starts up and loads all the dictionaries, and then “forks"
child processes which actually do the processing

■	Parent acts similar to the xks_app_launcher, managing restarts for the
children when they die

■	When dictionaries are modified, parent reloads them and restarts the children

■	“xks proc” will show an “X/Y" number next to process_data_parent

•	This is the number of children currently running, over the number that
should be running (based on the xks.config num_data_processors setting)

•	pdp will show up yellow anytime X != Y and green when everything is
running normally

•	This means when you first (re)start pdp, it will show yellow while it is
loading the dictionaries, because none of the actual child process_data's
are running yet

■	“xks proc" will report extra or missing process_dataX with a PID of 0

•	Can't tell what PID missing process_data is suppose to have, because its
managed by the parent now
