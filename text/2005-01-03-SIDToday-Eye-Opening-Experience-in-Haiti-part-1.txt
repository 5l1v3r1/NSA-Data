(S//SI)<br>(S//SI) This past year, I had the opportunity to spend two months<br>as a NIST analyst in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The deployment was a<br>classic NIST operation in that it was designed to be temporary and<br>the entire team was composed of personnel from several<br>intelligence agencies, including NSA, CIA, NGA, and DIA. However,<br>the deployment was problematic from the beginning. To start with,<br>it had to be organized at the last minute, since the US troop<br>deployment to Haiti came about unexpectedly.<br>(S//SI) Adding to the confusion, it was SOUTHCOM (U.S. Southern<br>Command) HQ that requested the NIST deployment and not the<br>Marines on the ground in Haiti. As a result of this, there was some<br>friction on site between the Marines running the military compound<br>and our NIST team. Gear that would normally deploy with the NIST<br>was left behind because NIST planners had been told that tents,<br>electric power, and air conditioning would be provided on site.<br>When we arrived, none of this equipment was available and we had<br>to send for our gear. As a result, the normal set-up period of 24<br>hours turned into more than a week, during which period I read<br>several books and tried to stay hydrated.<br><br>(U//FOUO) Canadian and US intel tent compounds at CJTF-Haiti:<br>The Canadian tents are the robust green ones on the left, the<br>smaller green ones in the center are US.<br>(S//SI) We finally received all of our gear, but only after spending<br>a week set up in a basic tent with a few fans and lots of hot<br>computer gear. (This miserably hot experience was replicated later<br>in the final weeks of the deployment when our generator's power<br>core fused together creating, in the words of an engineer back at<br>NSA, "a giant paper weight"). On the worst days without AC, it<br>would take me 15 minutes for my shirt to become soaked with<br>sweat just by sitting in the tent.<br>(C) The biggest operational hurdle to overcome in an environment<br>like Haiti is simply operational familiarity. While many of the<br>military operators with CENTCOM (Central Command) are now<br>familiar with the value-added capabilities that a NIST type element<br>can provide, this is certainly not always the case elsewhere. The<br>military is designed to operate as an organic unit, and for a unit<br>from SOUTHCOM unaccustomed to working with national-level<br>intelligence assets, the NIST functions like a synthetic organ or<br>body part. The Marine host tried to incorporate the new piece as<br>best it could. With this in mind, strong communication between<br>NIST leaders and military commanders is essential both early and<br><br>1.

This is<br>an amazingly potent combination and can outweigh the<br>disadvantage that most forward-deployed analysts do not have<br>years of background on the target they are working. Remember<br>that every person you physically contact while forward-deployed<br>represents someone that is often beyond the reach of the target<br>analyst at the Fort.<br>(TS//SI) So while I was very limited in my knowledge of the target<br>when I arrived in Haiti, my access to target knowledge was<br>unmatched. The Caribbean and Haiti target offices are<br>representative of so many that struggle here in the agency. They<br>are 5-7 people deep but they do the work of 50. Their production<br>is top notch and any time I had questions, I knew whom to turn to.<br>Within the NIST itself, the CIA personnel often have years of<br>experience in the target and they have their own access to<br>personnel and historical databases for targets of interest.<br><br>(U) A view of the dining tents. The green wall is actually the fence<br>to the outside world; the green border was hung on the chain-link<br>fence to prevent children from begging for food while soldiers ate<br>their meals.<br><br>(U//FOUO) A military chow line was set up with "T-rats" (Trations... ready-to-eat food that comes in trays for easy<br>preparation). Odds are that the signature meat on the plates in the<br>picture is some sort of pressed turkey or chicken meat product with<br>gravy.
