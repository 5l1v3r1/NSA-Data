(U) Why We Care

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) S2 - many of our targets

communicate over Huawei produced
products

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) S3 - design, deployment &

market expansion impact access to
communications .

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) From NIE, The Global Cyber Threat to the US

Information Infrastructure: “We assess with high
confidence that the increasing role of international
companies and foreign individuals in US information
technology supply chains and services will increase
the potential for persistent, stealthy subversions.”

I	have kind of been hinting at this all along, but why do we care?

Many of our targets communicate over Huawei produced products, we want to make sure that we know how to exploit these products - we also want to
ensure that we retain access to these communication lines, etc. There is also concern that Huawei’s widespread infrastructure will provide the PRC with
SIGINT capabilities and enable them to perform denial of service type attacks. This was all stated in the National Intelligence Estimate that came out a
few months ago: “the increasing role of international companies and foreign individuals in US information technology supply chains and services will
increase the potential for persistent, stealthy subversions.”

So to recap, this is what we are hoping to accompish:

TS//SI//REL) Determine if Huawei is doing SIGINT for PRC.

(TS//SI//REL) Perform more analysis on Huawei Corp - define relationships, organisation, plans. etc.

(TS//SI//REL) Direct efforts against nteligence gaps - IRM decrypts, underwater liber. RSD faciities. follow the money, supply chain, etc.

(TS//SI//REL) Focus on high prioriy targets - Iran. Afghanistan. Pakistan. Kenya. Cuba

(TS//SI//REL) Leverage Huawei presence to gain access to networks of interest

(TS//SI//REL) Document processes to be used later for targeting other non-partnerable companies.

So what are we going to do about it? The irst step was to form a TOPI, so that we can start to report some of our fndings and continue tasking the communications. However, targeting Huawei is a big. messy task. In order to
help us focus, we broke Huawei into three pillars: The Company. The Technology. The Deployment of the Technology.

When we look at these three different aspects of Huawei we found that two topics showed up across the board - market*)g and plansAntentions. So that is our main focus. If we can see how Huawei is marketing iself. and
working to expand this will help us to understand the company's plans and retentions. If we can determine the company's plans and intentions, we hope that this wil lead us back to plans and intentions of the PRC.

We will consider ourselves a success if we
