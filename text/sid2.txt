Having served on one ?eld tour at NCEUFL
Stuttgart, Germany, in the mid-199GB, Iwaa once again
fortunate to get an offer for another ?eld assignment in

Cermanyjust years later, at NSA's Eurnpean
Technical Center in Wieshaden. The pnsitinn at ETC
was as a Fnreign Relatinns Sta?'D?icer, 
technical tn NSA's Third Party
partners in Eurnpe and the Middle East. My wife served
as NSA's liaisnn tn the Army's 66th Military Intelligence
Crnup in Darmstadt. We lived hetween Wieshaden and
Darmstadt, due snuth nf Frankfurt, and nur 
children went tn the in Darmstadt.

Fer a career Intelligence and Language Analyst,
the mast interesting and rewarding aspects at
ETC were expnsure tn the engineering that NSA
dues and tn the superb grnup nfpenple carry it cut.
It was a pleasure, indeed, even an inspiratinn, tn deal with
the technical put SICINT and related
systems in place, tn witness their expertise, and tn gain
greater awareness nftechnical maintenance, and
lngistics The engineering and lngistics friends I
made in Wieshaden are nnes I wnuld likely have met
in my regular career ?eld hack heme, and I learned a let
them. NSA's fnreign partnerships and
snmetimes dealing directly with fnreign partners was a
particularly interesting experience as well.

Outside the mast rewarding aspect nfliving
in the Rheinland area nfCermany is the tn
travel Germany and much nfEurnpe. France, the
Benelux cnuntries, and Switzerland are all within a few
hnurs' drive, fer a weekend nr, far harder destinatinns
such as Strashnurg, even a day trip. lnnger drives,
Paris and Berlin are within six hnurs drive, the Alps are
hnurs away, depending nn which mnuntain is being
snught, and ether destinatinns - in snuthern France, the
Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slevenia, Crnatia, and
Italy - are within reasnnahle lung-distance reach far an
extended vacatinn. Living near Frankfurt alsn puts nne
very clnse tn rail and air tn anywhere in
Eurnpe, including lnw-cnst air travel tn many Eurnpean
destinatinns. It was a thrill tn he a_hle tn visit sites [if
histnrical and cultural signi?cance during nur tnur, and
living in Germany has marked nur children with a
cnnsiderahle appreciatinn Eurnpean and
culture.

The middle Rhein area between MainxfWieshaden and
Knhlenx is quite scenic and n?'ers many tn
sample aspects nf Cerman life, especially 
pleasures, clnser tn hnme. Ynu dnn't have tn gn far tn ?nd

within the Rheingau wine area; the Rheinhessen is just
the Rhein, and the Rbeinpfaltx [Rbeinland
Palatinate} and Mnsel-Saar-Ruwer reginns, as well as the
French prnvince anlsace, are clnse by. Even
wine reginns, like Francnnia, are within
reach.

As far cuisine, eating in Germany can be a real
pleasure far all but the mast cnnservative tastes. I have
had a had German meal yet. anal specialties abnund;
in the RheinfMain plain clnser tn Darmstadt, the Germans
grew the sweet, white asparagus ["Spargel") that is
harvested in May and enjnyed thrnughnut Germany. The
strawberry seasnn immediately thereafter.

It might belabnr the nbvinus that I enjnyed
living in Germany tn nn end. Wnrking and living in the
?eld is a great experience, and wnrking at ETC and living
in Germany was nn exceptinn. I'd dn it again.
