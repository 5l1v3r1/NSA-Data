- Working definition: Active implant copies traffic and
directs a copy past a passive collector

Issues arise when collector is also processing passive traffic
simultaneously

Current: Implants on network infrastructure devices,
not user endpoints

- Two types:
Physical/link layer:

an implant copies and shapes an entire link (E1, without
selection; passive midpoint does selection

Network layer:

an implant performs targeted copying based on IP or
application parameters and exfils only the targeted traffic;
passive collector may or may not do further selection.

- Link layer: BRAVENICKEL project (optical Muxes)

Copied link is not disguised, just routed on an unused layer
2 path that a passive collector can monitor

Selection happens in the passive collector

- Network layer: APEX for HAMMERMILL (routers)

Router is tasked to select and exfil targeted traffic (perhaps
all of a particular protocol)

Exfil is disguised (?munged?, to avoid detection

Passive collector looks for IP source/destination address in
order to detect the traffic

If further selection/processing is to be done in collector, the
exfil must be ?unwrapped? (unmunged, 

Exfil can be directed to passive or to TAO by changing the
destination address

TAO implants have collection parameters that are put
on exfil received thru TAO backend
case notation, SIGAD, PDDG, classification/legal authority

The passive collector has another set of these:

Site has a SIGAD, collector has a PDDG, the link it sees the
traffic on has a case notation, and the access has a
classification floor/legal authority

Current backend repositories and presenters weren?t
designed to expect TWO of 

Which gets put on the And where?

And (drum roll)  how do we solve this problem
CONSISTENTLY across the enterprise?

IPSEC VPN:

First packets between the devices establish the parameters
and keys (IKE)

Following this setup, ?content? packets are and
transmitted packet by packet (ESP)

CES wants the IKE exchange and maybe the ESP (content)

- TURMOIL passive capability:

Passive capability to detect IKE and ESP
Metadata record produced for every IKE exchange
IKE for targeted VPN forwarded directly to CES database

For targeted VPN, real-time is performed IF CES
can provide a key in time

IP traffic is processed by TURMOIL apps for
normal selection webmail, etc, etc)

- How do you want to identify the source of your data?
Does CaseNotation still make sense in this new world?

- You need to drive processes, systems, databases
toward a CONSISTENT answer

- Transformed systems and tools (METAWAVE,
Marina, etc.) need to be designed to do more than
accommodate

do ?the right thing? (whatever you the think that is)
Let me guess you want everything, don?t you?
