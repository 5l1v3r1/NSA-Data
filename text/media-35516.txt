•	Working definition: Active implant copies traffic and
directs a copy past a passive collector

-	Issues arise when collector is also processing passive traffic
simultaneously

•	Current: Implants on network infrastructure devices,
not user endpoints

•	Two types:

-	Physical/link layer:

•	an implant copies and shapes an entire link (El, STM1) without
selection; passive midpoint does selection

-	Network layer:

•	an implant performs targeted copying based on IP or
application parameters and exfils only the targeted traffic;
passive collector may or may not do further selection.

•	Link layer: BRAVENICKEL project (optical Muxes)

-	Copied link is not disguised, just routed on an unused layer
2 path that a passive collector can monitor

-	Selection happens in the passive collector

•	Network layer: APEX for HAMMERMILL (routers)

-	Router is tasked to select and exfil targeted traffic (perhaps
all of a particular protocol)

-	Exfil is disguised (“munged”, encrypted) to avoid detection

-	Passive collector looks for IP source/destination address in
order to detect the traffic

-	If further selection/processing is to be done in collector, the
exfil must be “unwrapped” (unmunged, decrypted)

-	Exfil can be directed to passive or to TAO by changing the
destination address

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL USA, FVEY



•	TAO implants have collection parameters that are put
on exfil received thru TAO backend

-	case notation, SIGAD, PDDG, classification/legal authority

•	The passive collector has another set of these:

-	Site has a SIGAD, collector has a PDDG, the link it sees the
traffic on has a case notation, and the access has a
classification floor/legal authority

•	Current backend repositories and presenters weren’t
designed to expect TWO of these!!!

•	Which gets put on the data??? And where?

•	And (drum roll) ... how do we solve this problem
CONSISTENTLY across the enterprise?

Example:

AMffluiihi r*e/hTAWfy

•	IPSECVPN:

-	First packets between the devices establish the parameters
and encryption keys (IKE)

-	Following this setup, “content” packets are encrypted and
transmitted packet by packet (ESP)

-	CES wants the IKE exchange and maybe the ESP (content)

•	TURMOIL passive capability:

-	Passive capability to detect IKE and ESP

-	Metadata record produced for every IKE exchange

-	IKE for targeted VPN forwarded directly to CES database

-	For targeted VPN, real-time decryption is performed IF CES
can provide a key in time

-	Decrypted IP traffic is processed by TURMOIL apps for
normal selection (VoIP, webmail, etc, etc)

•	Now app streams (VoIP, webmail, etc) extracted from
the tunnel carry two case notations

•	Which gets put into metadata records?

•	Both can be carried to PWV - but what happens after
that?

•	Not to mention...

-	Metadata records about VPN being stored in TOYGRIPPE

-	CES database storing IKE exchange

-	sourcelD - “The SIGAD of the site that provided the data”

•	APEX proposed extension: add

-	Agent CaseNotation

-	Agent ID (UUID)

-	Passive CaseNotation

•	Which caseNotation goes into searchable field?

-	Passive records won’t have the APEX block

-	TAO-collected records (returned viaTAO, not passive) won’t
have the APEX block

Shaping is hapi

•	Operational (or coming soon) shaping:

-	HAMMERSTONE - TCP traffic to FORNSAT, soon SSO

• No TURMOIL involvement

-	BRAVENICKEL - one operational flow - past SSO site

-	APEX - VPN metadata by end of June

•	Independent decisions being made about how to stuff
the double metadata into legacy databases

So what is voui

•	How do you want to identify the source of your data?

-	Does CaseNotation still make sense in this new world?

•	You need to drive processes, systems, & databases
toward a CONSISTENT answer

•	Transformed systems and tools (METAWAVE,
Marina, etc.) need to be designed to do more than
accommodate

-	do “the right thing” (whatever you the analysts think that is)

-	Let me guess - you want everything, don’t you?
