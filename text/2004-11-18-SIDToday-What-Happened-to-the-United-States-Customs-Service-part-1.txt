(part 1)<br>FROM:<br>NSA Representative to BCBP/BICE (S112)<br>Run Date: 11/18/2004<br><br>How responsibility for border security was consolidated in the Department of Homeland Security<br>(U)<br>(U) Protecting our nation's borders is of prime concern to all Americans today. The magnitude of<br>this challenge can better be appreciated when we consider that last year 55 million people<br>entered the U.S. by air, 15 million by sea, and 327 million over land. The number of vessels that<br>crossed our borders last year is also staggering: 203,000 ships with 9 million containers of<br>cargo; 576,000 commercial planes and 132,000 private aircraft; 11 million trucks; 2.4 million<br>rail cars; and 119 million cars.<br>(U) The enormous responsibility of keeping our borders safe from illegal activity and criminal<br>elements today lies primarily with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) and the<br>Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE), both within the Department of<br>Homeland Security. This article seeks to clarify and provide background information regarding<br>the transition of the former United States Customs Service and its associate partners into BCBP<br>and BICE.<br>A Herculean Task: Protecting our Borders<br>(U) Our country shares a 5,252-mile border with Canada and a 1,989-mile border with Mexico,<br>with just over 300 international land-based ports of entry. Intertwined with our borders is a<br>maritime system that includes 95,000 miles of coastline and navigable waterways, as well as a<br>global transportation network of over 300 seaports, 429 commercial airports, and several<br>hundred thousand miles of highways and railroads that offer access to almost every community<br>within America. One quickly realizes that the challenges to the defense of this network and the<br>nation's security are immense.<br>(U) Prior to the formation of the Department of Homeland Security three separate agencies were<br>responsible for border security:<br>The United States Customs Service (Department of Treasury),<br>the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (Department of Agriculture), and the<br>Immigration and Naturalization Service (Department of Justice).<br>Included within the Immigration and Naturalization Service was the United States Border Patrol.<br>(U) With the formation of the Department of Homeland Security, components of these agencies<br>were reassembled as BCBP and BICE and brought together under the Border and Transportation<br>Security Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security. In a nutshell, BCBP includes the<br>various inspectors at our borders plus the Border Patrol; BICE brings together the investigation<br>and enforcement elements.<br>(U) Watch for part two of this article soon on SIDtoday.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
