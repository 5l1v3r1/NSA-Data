(U//FOUO) Have you ever wanted to use foreign-TV news broadcasts to enhance your SIGINT, but
couldn't because you didn't understand the language? Soon you can! It is currently only available to
NSOC Desk Officers until logistical issues are resolved. However, the goal is to migrate Enhanced
Video Text and Audio Processing (eViTAP) into other areas. Additional information regarding how
to get accounts will be announced in the coming year, so stay tuned.

(U//FOUO) EViTAP is a fully-auto mated news monitoring tool. The key feature of this Intelink-
SBU-hosted tool is that it analyzes news in six languages, including Arabic, Mandarin Chinese,
Russian, Spanish, English, and Farsi/Persian. "How does it work?" you may ask. It integrates
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) which provides transcripts of the spoken audio. Next,
machine translation of the ASR transcript translates the native language transcript to English. Voila!
Technology is amazing.

(U//FOUO) This all sounds wonderful, but is it easy to use? Absolutely! EViTAP has an intuitive
and easy to use browser-based interface. The User Guide includes everything you need to
successfully use the tool. It is perfect for the analyst who usually prefers classroom over manual
instruction. The interface provides advanced search and retrieval capabilities, real-time fully
automated alerting, ability to create clips from videos, ability to edit transcripts and translations,
ability to export video and transcripts to PowerPoint, XML and text formats, and much more.

(U//FOUO) EViTAP's capabilities are far reaching, and go beyond the scope of this article, but it is
clear that this tool can significantly enhance SIGINT analysis and reporting. Open Source is
becoming more significant in the Intelligence Community, and eViTAP is an open source resource
that can play a big role in enabling SIGINT prosecution.
