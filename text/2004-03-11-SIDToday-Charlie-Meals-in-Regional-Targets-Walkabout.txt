One of Mr.<br>Meals first assignments at NSA some years ago was to the Weather Desk in NSOC which<br>explains his deep interest in that mission.<br>(S) The International Organizations Branch Branch Chief, Ms.<br>, then provided an<br>overview of their own unique mission. Technical Leader Ms. <br>, IA Intern Mr.<br> and Subject Matter Expert Ms.<br> each discussed the targets and<br>associated responsibilities. Mr. Meals was particularly interested in the background of each,<br>asking many questions about their careers and job satisfaction.<br>(S) Finally, Mr. Meals visited the two SIGDEV branches where the branch chiefs, MSgt Ann<br>Warwick and Mr. <br> briefed their specific missions followed by specific discussions<br>with various members of each branch. The discussions included the division of effort to do TCOM<br>research against several Africa countries by Team Chief Mr. <br>, ARCVIEW projects by<br>one of the division's SIGDEV contractors, and the initiatives to fill much-needed linguistic gaps<br>by several others.<br>(U//FOUO) Those who met Mr. Meals were very appreciative that he would take the time to visit,<br>and he was equally impressed with their complete dedication to the missions and how the<br>analysts and reporters work together to successfully prosecute each mission despite resource<br>needs. His questions focused on issues that are of concern to everyone, asking about resources,<br>interns, SIGDEV contractors, training, and leveraging the Extended Enterprise, especially the<br>RSOCs.<br>(U//FOUO) The division members very much enjoyed the opportunity to showcase their<br>important work and enjoyed talking with him in this informal setting and agreed that seeing his<br>genuine interest in their work was one of this year's highlights. All thought his visit was too<br>short and hope that he will be able to stop again in the future.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
