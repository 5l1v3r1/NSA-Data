It was established by Lieutenant<br>General John A. Samford, Director, NSA, in a memorandum dated<br>October 1957. The CMI has been an integral part of the<br>mathematics community at NSA ever since its inception.<br>(U//FOUO) The purpose of the Institute is to promote those<br>aspects of mathematics which pertain to cryptology and to provide<br>a focal point for the NSA mathematics community in fields of<br>common interest. Its membership is open to anyone with an<br>interest in crypto-mathematics.<br>(U//FOUO) CMI sponsors a variety of social and scholarly events,<br>often in conjunction with an Agency office or the Professional<br>Health Program (PHP). For example, CMI and the Mathematics PHP<br>co-sponsored a talk on June 3, 2004 by Professor Ron Rivest, the<br>"R" in RSA*. Regular CMI activities include a monthly newsletter<br>and seminar . Annually, CMI hosts a pizza luncheon for newly<br>hired mathematicians and an all-day classified mathematics<br>conference called Mathfest . The main social event and<br>celebration of professional highlights is the annual awards banquet<br>at the end of the academic year.<br>(U//FOUO) The Institute bestows a variety of honors at the annual<br>banquet: essay contest prizes, Distinguished Memberships, CMI<br>President's Award, and CMI Teaching Award.<br>The CMI Essay Contest was established in 1959 to<br>recognize outstanding written contributions to the fields of<br>mathematics and cryptology.<br>The Distiguished Members form the CMI Hall of Fame,<br>drawn from retirees in the extended classified mathematics<br>community.<br>Since 1978, the CMI President's Award (or<br>mathematician of the year) has recognized Agency<br>personnel who are making important contributions to the<br>mission of the cryptologic community through the<br>development and application of the science of mathematical<br>cryptology.<br>The CMI Teaching Award was established in 1997 to<br>honor important teaching contributions to the mathematics<br>community.<br>(U//FOUO) A complete listing of CMI officers and activities appears<br>on the CMI internal website , (or "go cmi").<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Learned<br>Organizations <br>1.
