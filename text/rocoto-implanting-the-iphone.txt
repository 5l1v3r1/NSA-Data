[edit] (S) Rocoto: Implanting the iPhone

(U) Presenter:

(S) In this talk, we will discuss efforts at JHU/APL to create IC tools for the iPhone 3G. We will present an
analysis of the software and firmware on the device, including discussion of the challenges presented by
signature checks and the chain of trust. We will then share a summary of 'jailbreak' methods used in the
iPhone community and how those capabilities can be leveraged by IC tools. We will conclude with a look
ahead at future challenges presented by the iPhone 3GS and the upcoming iPad.
