Notes:

1. For tasking requests: this form is not to be used for addresses in the British Islands (ie:
the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) except with OPP-LEG agreement.

2.	For content database searches only (datamining): this form may be used for addresses
in the British Islands, and must then be sent to an authorised SCS officer for approval.

In these cases one historical search only can be conducted within two working
days of the approval and these STAs cannot be renewed.

For datamining overseas: permitted for a one-week period only and cannot be renewed.

3.	SDO can only authorise OOH. Appropriate authorisation should be sought at earliest
opportunity on the next working day.

4.	All STAs (new and renewal) must be quality checked - this is a mandatory requirement.
Any application not quality checked will be returned.

5.	If a target enters a sensitive location, revaluate your tasking and detask or seek
appropriate authorisation.

6.	It is not necessary have a COP ref number to submit a new application - you will be
advised of the COP number upon receipt of email authorisation.

7.	Once you have completed the form for either a new application or renewal, email it to
the appropriate authorising officer who will then ‘email authorise’ and send a copy to
you and STAUPDATE-GCHQ.
