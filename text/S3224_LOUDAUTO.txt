LOUDAUTO

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) Audio-based RF retro-reflector. Provides room
audio from targeted space using radar and basic post-processing.

(U) Capabilities

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) LOUDAUTO’s
current design maximizes the gain of the
microphone. This makes it extremely useful for
picking up room audio. It can pick up speech at
a standard, office volume from over 20' away.
(NOTE: Concealments may reduce this distance.)
It uses very little power (-15 uA at 3.0 VDC), so
little, in fact, that battery self-discharge is more of
an issue for serviceable lifetime than the power
draw from this unit. The simplicity of the design
allows the form factor to be tailored for specific
operational requirements. All components at
COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.

(U) Concept of Operation

TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) Room audio is picked up by the microphone and
converted into an analog electrical signal. This signal is used to pulse position
modulate (PPM) a square wave signal running at a pre-set frequency. This
square wave is used to turn a FET (field effect transistor) on and off. When
the unit is illuminated with a CW signal from a nearby radar unit, the
illuminating signal is amplitude-modulated with the PPM square wave. This
signal is re-radiated, where it is picked up by the radar, then processed to
recover the room audio. Processing is currently performed by COTS
equipment with FM demodulation capability (Rohde & Schwarz FSH-series
portable spectrum analyzers, etc.) LOUDAUTO is part of the
ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar retro-reflectors.
