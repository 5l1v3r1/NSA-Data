"Isn't that in the middle of nowhere?"<br>(U) I nodded. We stared at each other across the table, trying to imagine our lives at such a<br>remote location. But <br> applied and was accepted, and more than a year later, here we are in<br>the Outback.<br> <br>(U) Alice Springs is a town of 27,000 people that gets almost 400,000 tourists a year. Most<br>visitors prefer to come in the fall and winter; in summer, the heat regularly exceeds one<br>hundred degrees. The nearest cities of any size, Adelaide and Darwin, are eight hundred miles<br>away to the north and south. There's virtually nothing east or west, except snakes, lizards and<br>kangaroos. It's one of the most remote cities of its size anywhere in the world, and that sense of<br>adventure was part of its appeal.<br>(U) Alice is the kind of place where you make your own fun, so we've been to the Camel Cup,<br>the annual camel races, and the Henley-on-Todd, where people race in bottomless boats in the<br>dry Todd riverbed. <br>(U) Besides those two annual events, we've also taken rides on a camel and in a hot-air balloon,<br>and we've enjoyed didgeridoo concerts, a night of star gazing, and trips to Uluru (Ayers Rock),<br>Sydney, Tasmania and New Zealand. We've watched kangaroos hop across the land behind our<br>house, and we've awakened to the screeching of exotic pink and gray parrots. We've seen some<br>incredible sunrises, and for the first time in my life, I've been able to see the milky part of the<br>Milky Way. The stars are so bright in Alice's clear air, you'd swear you could touch them.<br>(U) For an isolated city of its size, Alice has an energetic arts community. I was surprised at how<br>large and modern the local arts center is, with two theaters and several galleries. It attracts<br>national performers, from award winning dance and music groups to the annual Melbourne<br>Comedy Festival Roadshow. Several different arts and music festivals celebrating local talent<br>take place during the year. The Alice Springs Choral Society, which I've joined, performs some<br>of the most challenging music I've ever sung.<br>(U) Many people associate Alice Springs and its constant sunshine with year-long outdoor sports.<br>Neither of us is the athletic type, but if we wanted to try, there's plenty of opportunity. People<br>play on all kinds of teams, for all age groups - baseball, softball, rugby, soccer, netball,<br>volleyball, Aussie-rules football, tennis, swimming, you name it. There are a couple of cycling<br>clubs, and many folks enjoy camping nearby.<br>(U) Since you don't have to spend time sitting in traffic, Alice is a great place to try new things.<br>I've been fossicking for garnets. We've fed black-footed wallabies that live on a nearby rocky<br>hillside. I'm planning to cycle the eighteen miles to the facility before winter's end this year. I<br>can't draw, but didn't let that stop me from taking up watercolors.<br><br> </p>(U) Our first year of our two-year tour seemed to fly by, and it was time to decide if we wanted<br>to extend. We didn't have to discuss that very long. For a place in the middle of nowhere, we've<br>found the quality of our lives here to be high. With the lack of traffic, the sunny weather, and<br>the variety of experiences we've enjoyed, we're happy to stay two more years in this town<br>called Alice.<br>(U//FOUO) See the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap webpage .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
