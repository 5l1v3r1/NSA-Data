(TS//SI//NF) This slide depicts the theoretical construct for a national security framework.

a.	The black area depicts a small set of facts that will need special protection at the Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) (NSA) and Special Access Program (SAP) for the rest of the Executive Branch. Normally, these
ECI/SAP facts will remain within each Department/Agency and will represent Computer Network Operations (CNO) Core Secrets.

b.	The red (Top Secret), orange (Secret) and yellow (Confidential) areas depict a set of facts that will be shared amongst National Initiative elements. General facts related to the National Initiative should be kept at these
classification levels in order to facilitate maximum information sharing amongst all National Initiative elements (U.S. and foreign governments).

c.	The blue (Unclassified/For Official Use Only) area depicts a set of facts and operational results that will be shared/released to U.S. and foreign governments. State and Local governments, industry and academia related
to the National Initiative.

d.	The green (Unclassified) area depicts a set of facts and operational results that will be shared/released to the public.
