Well, that's life. We who strive for absolute<br>clarity in one reading have to accept this characterization in the<br>interests of the customer. Having said that, however, we<br>acknowledge that some of us may be guilty of change for the sake<br>of change. To these disciples of H.G. Wells ("No passion on earth,<br>no love or hate, is stronger than the passion to change someone<br>else's draft"), we warn against the phenomenon known as<br>"changing happy to glad."<br>(U//FOUO) Make your changes substantive. They should<br>improve the clarity and the readability of the piece, not merely<br>reflect stylistic preferences (although you may sometimes find<br>yourself explaining patiently that "would of went" is not just a<br>matter of preference, it's incorrect -- but that's part of the job).<br>Think about whether your intended audience would know, for<br>instance, what a martinet is...and if there's any doubt, choose<br>another expression (e.g. nit-picker, rigid rule enforcer).<br>(S//SI) Be particularly wary of inserting colloquial expressions in<br>product reports. A British colleague recalls a strand of reporting<br>where NSA was wholly dependent on cryptanalytic and language<br>skills available only at GCHQ; the Brits used to share translated<br>decrypts with the NSA Target Office of Primary Interest, who<br>issued far more of them than the GCHQ TOPI, and in which,<br>naturally, U.S. spellings would replace the British ones.<br>(U//FOUO) He was amused when one text that he had sent over<br>the pond included the phrase "would be dismissed." The NSA<br>reporter had changed this to "would receive a pink slip." Our British<br>correspondent had to tell his NSA counterpart that to a UK or<br>Commonwealth reader this would imply only a pastel-colored lady's<br>undergarment. Think about this pitfall if your product report's<br>distro list includes Second Parties. (If, on the other hand, you're<br>writing a reassuring announcement from the Human Resources<br>Department about increasing the attrition rate, such an expression<br>might not be out of place. The point is to consider your particular<br>audience.)<br>(U//FOUO) Now for the other side of the story: writers, don't fall<br>in love with your own words. Learn to recognize good editing<br>by thinking of your target audience; does a change -- that, yes,<br>might suppress your brilliant flourishes -- make the piece clearer,<br>more succinct, more thorough? Keep in mind the words of Dr.<br>Samuel Johnson: "Read your own compositions, and when you<br>meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it<br>out."<br>(U//FOUO) For more advice on writing and reporting, see The<br>Reporting Page and The Reporting Forum .<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Write Right '04 <br>1.
