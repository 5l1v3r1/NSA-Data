(UHFOUOJ We've posted articles recently examining speci?c NSM?T?hird Party relationships} but today we'd like to step back and look at the
big picture- What is NSA's underlying motivation behind its dealings with Third Party nations. and what approach do we use? To ?nd out.
SIDtorlay askedl HEDWTED I Jictured). from the SIGINT Operations Group in NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate to answer a few
questions. Here's what told as:




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I l. (U) Does NSA establish 3rd Party ties to meet speci?c short-term needs, or do we take a more long-term approach. thinking in
terms of developing relationships over the course of decades J. even though they may not bearfruitfor some time?

We establish foreign partnerships to satisfy US. intelligence requirements. For speci?c short-term needs. it may be suf?cient to work through
CIA Chiefs of Station at those locations where we do not have SIGINT partnerships established. Formal relationships require considerable resources. so
if we can meet our objectives -- particularly short-term ones working through CIA. that's okay. If . on the other hand. our SIGIN exchanges increase in
volume andlor complexity. or if a direct partnership is necessary because of Indications and Warning considerations we need rapid. direct
exchange of information), then we will establish a formal SIGINT relationship. after DNI approval.

(CHRELI Many of our relationships have. indeed. spanned several decades. allowing us to establish higher degrees of trust with and reliance on one another.
This. in turn. has led to greater levels of cooperation, where. for instance. NBA might be willing to share advanced techniques with a proven and reliable
partner. in return for that partner's willingness to do something politically risky. Trust requires years to build up but it can be lost in a very short period of
time.

- 2. (U) What are we q?er, in general? ls it our partners' accesses. or their expertise on a speci?c or is it impossible to generalize, because it
varies on a case-breasts basis?

Yes. yes yes! Our partners' geography and access to high-priority target communications are a huge plus. as is their expertise on specific
targets. With rare exception. they know their regional 'hoods better than we do and they exponentially add to our foreign language capability.

- 3. (U) Are ourforeign intelligence relationships usually msuiatedfmm short-term political ups and downs, or not?

For a variety of reasons. our intelligence relationships are rarely disrupted by foreign political perturbations. international or domestic- First. we
are helping our partners address critical intelligence shortfalls. just as they are assisting us. Second. in many of our foreign partners? capitals. few senior
of?cials outside of their defense-intelligence apparatuses are wilting to any SIGIN connection to the U.SJNSA.

There are exceptions. both on the positive and negative sides. For instance. since the election of a pro?American president. one European partner
has been much more open to providing information on their own capabilities and techniques. in hope of raising our intelligence collaboration to a higher level.
Convenely. another of our partnerships has stalled. due largely to that country's regional objectives not being in with those of the U5.

9 4. (U) What do Third Parties typically as? What do dig get out of tire relationship?

Generally speaking. our Third Party partners want access to our technology, as well as our regionallglobal reach. In exchange for their providing
unique accesses. regional analytical exmrtise. foreign language capabilities andr?or raw support. we provide them with technical solutions hardware.
software) andtor access to related technology. We must keep in mind that our partners are attempting to satisfy their own national intelligence requirements;
with the exception of the assistance we provide during crises. we can only move our SIGINT relationships forward. when US. requirements intersect with
theirs.

you for the opportunity to describe some of our foreign partnering considerations. It's important for us to foot-stomp that FAD is an
enabling organization. We do not conduct relationships in a vacuum; and our Country Desk Of?oers. front-end SIGINT Liaison Of?cers. Foreign Affairs
