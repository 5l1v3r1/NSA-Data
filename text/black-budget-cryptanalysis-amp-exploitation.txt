(U) Project Description

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The Analysis of Target Systems Project produces prototype capabilities to
exploit new communications technologies and systems which are then integrated into the SIGINT system
via the Exploitation Solutions Project in this Expenditure Center (EC). This Project enables the defeat
of strong commercial data security systems; develops capabilities to exploit emerging information systems
and technologies that are employed or may be employed by SIGINT targets; develops analytic algorithms,
processes, and procedures to exploit emerging information systems technologies; and develops initial recognition,
exploitation, and prototype solutions against new technology targets. This Project contains the Information
Systems Analysis and Cryptanalytic Vulnerability Discovery & Exploitation Solutions Sub-Projects.

(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Conduct vulnerability analysis and develop exploitation capabilities against
network communications protocols and commercial network security products, including protocol structure,
authentication and access control, data integrity, and non-application layer encryption for integration into
Endpoint and MidPoint access solutions for use against high-priority SIGINT targets.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide target exemplar secure communications products, both foreign
and domestic produced, to pursue vulnerability analysis and develop exploitation capabilities against the
authentication and encryption schemes.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support work to provide capabilities against emerging communications
technologies through error correction, demodulation, reverse-engineering, multiplexers, and personal
communications interfaces.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Perform analysis of information security systems, products, and services in
order to develop exploitation solutions designed to address customer-driven and anticipatory requirements.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Anticipate future encryption technologies of SIGINT targets and prepare
strategies to exploit those technologies.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop, enhance, and implement software attacks against encrypted
signals.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop exploitation capabilities against specific key management and
authentication schemes.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Analyze and develop exploitation capabilities against emerging multimedia
applications (video, voice, fax, data compression, and file formats) and multiplexer capabilities.

facilitate CNE operations against target systems and to facilitate offensive/defensive Computer Network
Operations (CNO).

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA FVEY) Create comprehensive CNO capabilities, including Radio Frequency (RF)-
based, against highly mobile and re-configurable communications networks, and support their integration
into multiple military service-level elements.

the needs of the cryptanalytic community.

•	(S//SI//RELTO USA, FVEY) Support investment in reverse engineering through partnerships with National
Laboratories and engineering services contractors.

•	(S//SI//RELTO USA, FVEY) Develop initial recognition, exploitation, and prototype solutions against new
technology targets. These capabilities are integrated into the processing and exploitation infrastructure or
into customized tactical exploitation capabilities.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop methods to discover and exploit communication systems
employing public key cryptography.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop methods to exploit communications protected by passwords or pass
phrases.
