(U//FOUO) Volunteers Wanted: Voice Language Analysts Needed for
Study
FROM:
Human Language Technologies (R64)
Run Date: 09/13/2005
(U//FOUO) R64 (Human Language Technologies) is conducting its second user study on the
Ovencaptive speech-to-text project in October 2005. At least 20 voice language analysts are
needed to participate.
(U//FOUO) **Please note: if you participated in our last user study in May, you will not be able
to participate in this one. Because we will be reusing the May data, we need a fresh set of
volunteers.**
(U//FOUO) R64 would need each voice language analyst for approximately two hours in R64
spaces in the R&E building. During that time you would be expected to scan machine-generated
transcripts in English (you can listen along, too), making analytic decisions about whether an
event has occurred.
(U//FOUO) We are also eager to get language new hires, language interns, and military
language analysts involved and excited about the new technologies that R64 is developing. The
only requirement is that you must have current experience in scanning foreign voice language
traffic, and not have participated in the May user study.
(U//FOUO) Please contact
questions.
