■	XKEYSCORE processes data at field sites,
where it is collected, and allows analysts from
all over the world to query it.

■	At field sites, the XKEYSCORE software can
run in clusters of few or many servers, giving it
the ability to scale in both processing power
and storage.

■	All processing is plugin or fingerprint based,
which allows new capabilities to be quickly
deployed to support operational needs.
