(U//FOUO) Notice the hash of the jpg

Uirui «car r*iu'»i

IM£GE formjt*e<

(TS//SI//REL) Now you take the 32-character hash (e.g.

6a476b2cedccb34946J5e9c76103d0f2) and paste that into a Document Metadata search
under the File/Embedded Image Hash field:

Search: Document Metadata

Query Name: [kmk9<h_7	|

Justification: |	1

File/EmbedOed Image |6a47Sb2cedccb34946f5e9c76103d0t2

(TS//SI//REL) Before you hit submit, you MUST think if the logo could be used by 5-
EYES protected entities. It should go without saying, but take extra precaution if you
think it could bring back 5-EYES traffic. What would you do to ensure it’s foreign?
Maybe AND that with a country?

(TS//SI//REL) Then hit submit and check your results. Your results MAY show you
actual files that were sent to and from people you’ve never HEARD OF (how cool is
that?)

Happy hunting..
