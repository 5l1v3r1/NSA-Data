(TS//SI//NF) Beginning on 7 March 2013, PRISM now collects Microsoft
Skydrive data as part of PRISM'S standard Stored Communications collection
package for a tasked FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (FAA702) selector.
This means that analysts will no longer have to make a special request to
SSO for this - a process step that many analysts may not have known about.
This new capability will result in a much more complete and timely
collection response from SSO for our Enterprise customers. This success is
the result of the FBI working for many months with Microsoft to get this
tasking and collection solution established. "SkyDrive is a cloud service
that allows users to store and access their files on a variety of devices.
The utility also includes free web app support for Microsoft Office
programs, so the user is able to create, edit, and view Word, PowerPoint,
Excel files without having MS Office actually installed on their device."
