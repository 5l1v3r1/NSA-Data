(TS//SI//REL) JETPLOW Persistence Implant Concept of Operations

(TS//SI//REL) JETPLOW is a firmware persistence implant for Cisco PIX Series and
ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. It persists DNT’s BANANAGLEE
software implant and modifies the Cisco firewall’s operating system (OS) at boot
time. If BANANAGLEE support is not available for the booting operating system, it
can install a Persistent Backdoor (PBD) designed to work with BANANAGLEE’s
communications structure, so that full access can be reacquired at a later time.
JETPLOW works on Cisco’s 500-series PIX firewalls, as well as most ASA firewalls
(5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, 5550).

(TS//SI//REL) A typical JETPLOW deployment on a target firewall with an exfiltration
path to the Remote Operations Center (ROC) is shown above. JETPLOW is
remotely upgradeable and is also remotely installable provided BANANAGLEE is
already on the firewall of interest.

Status: (C//REL) Released. Has been widely deployed. Current
availability restricted based on OS version (inquire for details).
