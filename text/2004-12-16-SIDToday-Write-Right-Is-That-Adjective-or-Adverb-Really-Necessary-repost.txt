The governing principle can be summed up in this<br>excerpt: "SIGINT reporters must approach their jobs with the same frame of mind as sign<br>writers or telegram drafters, striving to get the message across immediately. Our products<br>make up a small percentage of our customers' daily information deluge. If we want them to be<br>read, we must immediately capture the readers' attention, hold their attention, and convey the<br>message, i.e. the intelligence."<br>(U) The purpose of today's column is twofold: to urge writers both to be concise, and to examine<br>their writing for unconscious cliches. Is that adverb really needed? In other words, is it<br>necessary for the reader's understanding? For instance, was the effort "basically fruitless" or<br>was it "fruitless"? What does "basically" add? Nothing. Basically nothing. "Fundamentally,"<br>"essentially, "basically," and "successfully "are some of the most-used superfluous adverbs in all<br>writing today, not just reporting.<br>(U) We here needn't consider "major motion pictures" (does anyone make minor ones<br>anymore?), but we could probably save a considerable amount of bandwidth if everyone who<br>stuck in a "successfully" or "successful" stopped and thought about it. "Unsuccessful attempt" is<br>one of the few appropriate uses, and that's in the negative. "The test was successfully<br>completed" is no better than "the test was completed"; if you want to convey something about<br>the test RESULTS, you need a different term. "The test was completed without delay, with<br>satisfactory results," for instance. (We have had a computer programmer argue for "the system<br>successfully failed over," but we dismissed that as sophistry...or perhaps jargon.)<br>(U) We hope all our readers had a Happy and Successful Thanksgiving!<br>(U) This article first appeared on December 1st.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
