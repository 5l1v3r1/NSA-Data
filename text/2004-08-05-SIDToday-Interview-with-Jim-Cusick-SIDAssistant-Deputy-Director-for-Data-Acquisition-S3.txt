Jim Cusick, SID/Assistant Deputy<br>Director for Data Acquisition (S3)<br>FROM: Jim Cusick<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 08/05/2004<br>What was your first job at the Agency?<br>(S//SI) My first job at the Agency was intercepting Caesar's legions from a hilltop in Gaul.<br>Actually, I am not quite that old. I began my journey at NSA in 1972 as a Language Intern when<br>the Panel was chaired by the legendary<br> My language was German and in those<br>days all discrete German intercept was prosecuted in the German Branch of the European<br>Communist (EURCOM) North Division, so a German intern rotated from team to team within the<br>same branch for three years.<br>(S//SI) Having served as the NCOIC* of the Field Station Berlin East German Socialist Unity<br>Party (SED) Section, I had some experience working this target and began as an<br>analyst/linguist/reporter doing term studies (contrary to what you read in the press, we did<br>term analysis in the Dark Ages) based on huge volumes of discrete SED reporting. Listening to<br>the SED Politburo, Secretariat and Central Committee on the full gamut of issues any country<br>deals with was fascinating. I had to keep pinching myself to make sure I wasn't just dreaming<br>that they were actually paying me the staggering sum of $11,043/year to work with the<br>language I had studied for 10 years. No one should have that much fun without gaining weight<br>or breaking a law.<br>(U) What are some of the best opportunities you've had in your career?<br>(U//FOUO) Quite some time ago, I let it be known to NSA leadership that I was willing to take on<br>virtually any task as long as it was in the middle of the fray, it was challenging, and it made a<br>difference. Remember the old caution "Be careful what you ask for?" As a result, I have been<br>blessed with more opportunities than anyone has a right to dream of. Being a Senior Operations<br>Officer in NSOC has to rank as the best job in SIGINT by orders of magnitude. Serving as VADM<br>McConnell's Civilian Assistant was easily the best learning experience of my career. Heading up<br>Unconventional Operations and managing NSA's largest budget category was the hardest and<br>most demanding job I ever took on. Representing Lt Gen Hayden at the Pentagon during the<br>aftermath of 9/11 and during Operation Iraqi Freedom was fascinating and added a whole new<br>perspective on support to the warfighter and national-tactical integration. Walking out your door<br>and running into a Boy Scout Troop or a group of senior foreign military officers takes some<br>getting used to.<br>(U//FOUO) My 2.5 years representing NSA on the National Intelligence Collection Board opened<br>my eyes to what the rest of the Intelligence Community (IC) was doing on a daily basis and<br>earned me the coveted CACO, the Charlie Allen* Control Officer, moniker. For the record,<br>collaboration across the IC may not be perfect but has been going on non-stop for decades and I<br>never encountered anyone who thought ignoring or slow rolling a directive from the DCI was an<br>option. Chairing the Intelligence Analysis Career Panel reconnected me with my intern roots and<br>allowed me to assist in providing a solid foundation for NSA's most important resource: its<br>employees. My five tours outside the building exposed me to experiences, techniques,<br>leadership styles, and cultures that shaped everything I have done and the way I have<br>conducted myself.<br>(U) What has been the biggest change you've seen in the Agency during your career?<br>(U//FOUO) The biggest change has been the composition of the workforce and the leadership of<br>the Agency. When I was hired, some incredibly large -- I don't know the figure but if I had to<br>guess I would estimate that 85-90 percent would not be an exaggeration -- portion of the<br>workforce was recruited from what we now call the Service Cryptologic Elements. Inasmuch as<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">there were almost no women or persons of color in the ranks of the Army Security Agency<br>(ASA), the Naval Security Group (NSG), and the Air Force Security Service (AFSS), there were<br>very few women or persons of color at NSA when I came on board.<br>(U//FOUO) Sweeping changes in both military and civilian recruitment during the 70s changed<br>all that. The workforce and the leadership I see in the halls and in leadership fora are<br>exceptionally diverse and we are a far better NSA than we were 32 years ago. I am loath to<br>even begin to think how much less capable to meet the challenges of the future we would be<br>without outstanding people like <br> Carl Johnson, <br>, and Sherri Ramsay<br>just to name some of the very best who immediately spring to mind.<br>(U) What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(U//FOUO) Given my German language background and having lived in West Berlin for 11 years,<br>the most memorable experience in my career was the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Keen<br>analyst that I am, I would have bet you 10 years pay that the wall would never come down.<br>Unless you lived under its sinister shadow and within its confines, it is hard to truly appreciate<br>the meaning of that event.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>NCOIC = Noncommissioned Officer-in-Charge <br>Charlie Allen is the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Collection<br>(U) See other interviews in this series:<br>Interview with...
