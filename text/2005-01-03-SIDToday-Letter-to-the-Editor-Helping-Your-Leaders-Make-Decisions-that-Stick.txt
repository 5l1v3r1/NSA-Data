DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Letter to the Editor: Helping Your Leaders Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 01/03/2005<br><br>(U) We received some feedback on the article Helping Your Leaders<br>Make Decisions that Stick :<br>From:<br>(U) I wanted to say I thought the article entitled The Bald Truth:<br>Helping Your Leaders Make Decisions that Stick was a very good<br>article, and something that many people seem to need to hear. I<br>think that the prevelance of the Point Solution Briefing is the result<br>of -- continuing the analogy in the article -- the metaphor/analogy<br>virus that NSA suffers from. The virus often causes good ideas to<br>be taken way too literally, and the point they were trying to get<br>across is often overlooked.<br>(U) After all, it makes sense for people to make a Point Solution<br>Briefing when "leaders don't want to just hear problems, they want<br>solutions!" The Agency has a very bad habit of taking analogies,<br>example cases, and metaphors and turning them into the basis for<br>strategy. Just like a point-solution briefing can lead to the problem<br>not being solved because of constant re-evaluation, many other<br>programs end up being more harmful than useful because the<br>analogy or metaphor or other figure of speech is taken too literally.<br>(S//SI) Take the DNI content presentation philosophy, for<br>example: "Analysts want to see data the way the user saw it." So<br>now we have the concept of "native view." While we currently refer<br>to the "native" presentation of the data, analysts would not be<br>happy with -- and would not want to use -- a system that only<br>gave them a choice between displaying what the target saw or the<br>raw data. What analysts want, and have been able to get for some<br>data with current presentation systems, is something LIKE what<br>the user saw, but with all kinds of SIGINT information and normally<br>hidden data presented as well. Unfortunately, there are still future<br>systems that seem to be building to meet the "native view" simile,<br>instead of the true needs of the analyst.<br>(S//SI) Then there is the more general idea of how to get to<br>analysts' DNI data. It seems that examples are provided to<br>decision-makers such as "We want to see data like in the CNE<br>Portal" or "We want to view data as easily as going to a web<br>portal." Here again the analogy is often talked about as if it is the<br>solution. My hope is that leaders and solution providers have<br>worked to find out why analysts like these interfaces (they are<br>easy ways to traverse metadata of different kinds to get to content<br>that we care about, and provide customizable views and single<br>query points), and are building to the underlying needs of the<br>analysts.<br>(U) Again, I think this article is great to see from a leader, and<br>certainly something I hope a lot of others (especially those who<br><br> SERIES: <br>The Bald Truth<br>1.
