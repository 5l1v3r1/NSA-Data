DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Letters to the Editor: Helping Your Leaders Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 03/24/2004<br>(U//FOUO) We received several letters about Charles Berlin's<br>recent article The Bald Truth: Helping Your Leaders Make Decisions<br>That Stick :<br>(U//FOUO) Absolutely on point. The DoD is maturing it's own<br>governance and resource management processes. Management by<br>process does not "fix" everything but it does improve the basic<br>decision-making cycle. NSA, DoD, and the IC have goverance and<br>resource management processes. The processes are designed to<br>limit some of the problems that you have identified.<br>-- <br>(U//FOUO) These are excellent observations. Yet, option briefs<br>take much more preparation than point briefings. When staff are<br>spread thin and work without adequate prioritization, they may<br>resort to point briefs to keep their heads above water.<br>-- <br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Berlin's guidance on providing options and criteria<br>for decision making absolutely hit the nail on the head, but I<br>suggest this is two-way street. The person proposing a solution<br>should provide options and criteria, but leaders and decision<br>makers also need to reject proposed solutions that are NOT<br>accompanied by options and criteria. Even "point-solution" solution<br>outputs of acknowledged SIGINT-smart people should not be<br>readily accepted and ingested without at least a nominal analysis of<br>alternatives.<br>Just my systems engineer's $.02. Have a great SID day!<br>-- <br>(U//FOUO) This article was excellent. It described a problem that<br>we (NSAers) often see and experience, and cited a well thoughtout and 'doable' solution. YEAH!<br>-(U//FOUO) Uncertainty also arises from instability. When we revisit<br>old problems we thought we'd solved and keep re-solving them<br>because the solution we tried "really didn't improve anything", it<br>can result in continual tumult. Witness the performance evaluation,<br>compensation reform, and too-frequent reorganization<br>phenomena. But while some solutions will show good results in an<br>instant, in other cases for deep, meaningful, well-considered<br>approaches to improvement to evolve, we need to give it TIME to<br>evolve. We need to perhaps silence the voices constantly in our<br><br> SERIES: <br>The Bald Truth<br>1.  The Bald Truth:<br>Technical Leadership<br>2.  The Bald Truth: The<br>Sweet Conspiracy<br>3.

Letter to the Editor:<br>Helping Your Leaders<br>Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br><br> </p>ears harping with "That didn't work; try something else!" And we<br>need to look at those areas in SID and NSA where providing a<br>solution actually created a worse environment than the problem<br>had done. (But first we need to admit that this has happened.)<br>(U//FOUO) Wise deliberation and a more or less natural evolution,<br>rather than continual uproarious change just to please critics or the<br>metrics-masters who want the solutions to cure the patient "right<br>now" -- I feel we need the pendulum to swing, and we need to get<br>all our well-thought-out processes out of the way of its swinging.<br>(U//FOUO) The NSA workforce knows how to do its job when given<br>it. Stability, both organizational and procedural, will help us do<br>this, even when the job involves forward-thinking and<br>transformation. Evolution, not uproar. The workforce will let you<br>know when it's time to shake the tree a bit.<br>-(U//FOUO) Charles, you hit the nail on the head. Unfortunately,<br>NSA does not have a program which teaches folks how to do good<br>staff work. Most NSAers also do not think they are doing "staff<br>work" when they are putting together proposals or developing<br>options for programs, etc. Staff work is only done by those folks<br>who work on staffs, right? I hope that your article reaches down<br>and grabs most folks, and hopefully some lights will go on. When I<br>say "reaches down and grabs most folks" I also mean the<br>managers who in many instances are worried more about personal<br>risk avoidance rather than making the best decision.<br>--<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
