Deborah Maklowski, NSA/CSS Senior<br>Intelligence Authority and IA Skill Community Advocate<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/01/2004<br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Here's another chapter in our new "Interview<br>With..." series. Today's interview is with Deborah Maklowski, the NSA/CSS Senior<br>Intelligence Authority and IA Skill Community Advocate :<br>(U) What was your first job at the Agency?<br>(S//SI) My first cryptologic job was in the US Army. I signed up in 1978 to be a 98G/Polish<br>Linguist, in the hope that it would get me to Europe. I first had to make brief stops in Alabama<br>and Texas, but as a bonus, of course, I got the 47 weeks in Monterey (heaven!), and I did<br>eventually wind up in what was then West Berlin, working at the US Field Station. There may<br>have been better places than West Berlin to serve an INSCOM* tour in the late 70's, but there<br>can't have been very many.<br>(S//SI) The work was extremely interesting, and the city behind the Wall was fascinating: all the<br>benefits of living in a large, urban cultural center but curiously rural-feeling, with a river, several<br>lakes, and even its own forest. Add to that the city's very real atmosphere of international<br>intrigue, the moving and sometimes weird relics of post-war Germany, and the proximity of<br>President Reagan's Evil Empire, and it was The Perfect Tour. When my enlistment was up in<br>1982, I was hired by NSA as a Polish Language Intern. I did two tours in what was then called<br>A313 (and today isn't called anything, since we stopped working Poland as a target quite a while<br>ago), one on the domestic political target and one on the military side.<br>(S//SI) My third tour was as the apprentice to the analyst working Polish Military Trade and Aid<br>issues, where for the first time I got to do it ALL: manage my own targeting and collection, do<br>the language work AND target analysis, report, disseminate, and do customer support. It was<br>magic, and I liked it so much that when the analyst who was mentoring me took another<br>position, I asked to be released from the intern program to take the job permanently. Since I'd<br>met all my training objectives, had passed both parts of the PQE*, and had 4 years in the Army<br>to meet the experience criteria, the program agreed to release me.<br>(U) What is the biggest change you've seen at the Agency in your career?<br>(U//FOUO) For me, there are really two answers to that question. In my 21 years here, targets<br>have come and gone; we've debated the regional-vs-topical issue through at least 4 major<br>reorgs (and several more aborted ones); we've announced that RF is dead, only to discover that<br>many of our enduring targets weren't informed; we've jettisoned Traffic Analysis and then had<br>to reinvent it; and we've weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union, the birth of the European<br>Union, and the removal of the beer machines in the cafeteria. But there are two changes that<br>are so radical, so fundamental to the way we do business, that I believe they constitute seismic<br>shifts in our organizational culture.<br>(U//FOUO) The first of these is the advent of the desktop computer. Yes, the digital<br>telecommunications revolution is huge, too, but in fact I saw profound changes taking place in<br>our work centers long before email, long before Al Gore invented that Internet thing, and they<br>started the day the first IBM XTs were delivered to our office. With their 12" monitors, green<br>letters glowing on a black screen (so that, if you looked up after working too long, everything in<br>the room had a pinkish cast), and a graphics capability limited to what you could draw using<br>punctuation marks, the space bar, and too much unstructured work time, those Stone-Age PCs<br>nevertheless altered forever the way NSA analysts do work.<br>(S//SI) When I arrived here, there were a few desk-top terminals called Delta Datas, roughly<br><br> </p>one for every 10 or so analysts, upon which they could type their reports. But all traffic was<br>delivered and analyzed in hard copy or on magnetic tape; we still had to fill out cover sheets<br>and sourcing data ("back sheets") by hand; and -- most astoundingly -- the report that you<br>typed into the Delta Data went to a pool of typists who took your egram and transmitted it to<br>the customers by RETYPING IT into the dissemination system. All ancillary SIGINT processes -taskers and responses, target and policy research, operational notices and success stories, etc. - were done in hardcopy and walked from place to place (or sent through a pneumatic tube<br>system, like Macy's in the 1940s). And that was fewer than 20 years ago.<br>(S) The second seismic shift is Transformation 2.0. The "SIGINT as a Team Sport" concept<br>-- that we can and should engage our customers and partners at very early stages in the<br>analytic process; that, properly handled by a trusted workforce, a robust information sharing<br>relationship can produce better intelligence; and that our ability to add value, not the need to<br>produce a lot of egrams, should determine the point at which we share information -- is nothing<br>short of revolutionary. When I arrived here in the early 80's, the immutable policy was that NO<br>SIGINT information was to be shared with non-SIGINTers ever, under any circumstances, unless<br>and until it was officially published in a recognized SIGINT reporting vehicle. In fact, as recently<br>as 1999, when I was at the US Mission to the UN as the NSA Rep, there were several occasions<br>in which the NSA analysts and I had to find "creative" ways to give the customer essential, justin-time information that didn't too blatantly defy SIGINT dissemination policy. But the idea that<br>an analyst might actually be able to call up one of the USUN political officers, for example, to<br>get that expert's opinion on the true context or significance of a piece of unpublished SIGINT<br>was still anathema.<br>(S//SI) Over the past few years we've made great progress in redefining our relationships with<br>our customers, leaving behind the parental model ("Trust us: we KNOW what's good for you") in<br>favor of one that looks more like the business world's provider-client relationship. In general,<br>that's good, but in the SIGINT context, the provider holds a monopoly and the client has no<br>choices, and we all know how well THAT works. Transformation 2.0., however, looks more like a<br>business partnership, where each partner is valued for the unique contributions it brings to the<br>table, where information is a tool, not a prize, and where the success of the enterprise is a<br>shared responsibility. As this concept matures, it, too, will alter forever the way NSA analysts do<br>their work.<br>(U) What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(U//FOUO) For this answer, see the recently posted "InSIDer's View of History" article entitled<br>"SIGINT Appearing in the Press"<br>(U) What is the biggest challenge facing your organization right now?<br>(S) Without a doubt, our biggest challenge right now is hiring, training, placing, and mentoring<br>the Intelligence Analysis (IA) workforce that will see this nation through for the next 20 years.<br>It's patently clear to every NSA manager in those places where IAs are employed that we simply<br>do not have enough IAs to do the work that needs to be done. That's as true for the REALLY<br>REALLY high priority missions like counterterrorism and WMD proliferation as it is for those that<br>are just REALLY really high priority, like everything else. And it's as true in the field as it is at<br>HQs. We've seen an increase in hiring over the past 3 years that has certainly helped us begin<br>to close the gap, and as a result, we've brought in some truly remarkable talent, IAs who are<br>making huge strides in advancing the state of our knowledge about our targets and how we<br>prosecute them.<br>(S) But we're running a race against time, trying to hire the next generation of experts before<br>the previous generation, which must train them, walks out the door, and there are unfortunately<br>several natural limits to our ability to do this. Space is a big one: although the IA Skill<br>Community has the luxury of being able to select from an extremely large pool of qualified,<br>talented, and eager applicants, we could not possibly absorb at once all the people we need,<br>even if we were given unlimited hiring points. Another natural limiter is the training process :<br>the success of our IA intern program relies to a very large extent on the availability of<br>experienced target and topic mentors to make each intern's tour in a given office an effective<br>training experience. But the extremely high operational tempo in many offices, coupled with the<br>overall shortage of senior IAs, limits the number of new employees you can introduce into any<br>given workspace at any one time.<br><br> </p>(S) As the Chief of the TransAsia Division (whose targets included Afghanistan) on 9/11, I saw<br>first-hand what happens when an already too-thinly stretched analytic workforce is suddenly<br>overwhelmed by the addition of many bright and highly motivated people who nevertheless need<br>a lot of target training all at once: these new analysts are greatly disadvantaged by the overly<br>slow OJT* pace, and their initial enthusiasm turns pretty quickly to frustration that they are not<br>able to make the kinds of mission contributions they came to make. Other limiters include the<br>National Cryptologic School's (NCS) resources, which limits its ability to offer required<br>coursework; the number of people dedicated to handle IA recruitment and hiring (4, which<br>includes 3 from my staff and 1 from MB2/Hiring and Recruitment); and the number of people on<br>the IA Skill Community Director's staff to oversee the various IA training programs (interns,<br>cross-trainees, MINSAPers, and so forth).<br>(U) What is the most exciting project for the future that your org is undertaking right<br>now?<br>(U//FOUO) We're working hard to answer the charge from the DCI* and the Director to develop<br>a method for measuring the capability levels of our Intelligence Analysts. We've assembled a<br>great team that includes Anne Wright, Pardee Lowe, and Beth Mackey from the NCS (all of<br>whom are very experienced at this), my IA readiness expert <br> (who brings a thorough<br>knowledge of NSA's current assessment processes and of the larger systems into which any<br>future initiatives will need to fit), and recent IA intern program graduate<br>(who<br>brings the essential perspective of someone who HASN'T worked here since the Flood and keeps<br>us all honest), and we're making what I consider to be great strides.<br>(U//FOUO) This really is exciting work. I'm learning a great deal, working with some truly<br>remarkable people, and heading for some important results. It doesn't get much better than<br>that.<br>(U) Notes: <br>INSCOM = The U.S. Army's Intelligence and Security Command <br>PQE = Professional Qualification Exam <br>OJT = On-the-Job Training <br>DCI = Director of Central Intelligence <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
