DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) CSG Worldwide Conference - 2004<br>FROM:<br>Chief, CSG Support &amp; SID Visits Team (S1124)<br>Run Date: 06/08/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>Chief, CSG Support &amp; SID Visits Team (S1124) <br>(U//FOUO) From 11-14 May 2004, The Customer Gateway (S11) hosted the Worldwide<br>Cryptologic Services Group (CSG) Conference 2004. The 3-Â½ day conference was the first<br>since August 2001, and a priority for the Customer Account Management Division (S112) since<br>assuming responsibility for CSG support from the Military Integration office back in October<br>2003 (see related article) . The central theme of the conference was the impact of<br>Transformation 2.0 on CSG operations.<br>(U//FOUO) The conference attendees represented more than 20 CSGs from around the country<br>and around the world, to include Areas of Responsibility (AORs) such as CENTCOM, PACOM,<br>SOCOM, NCEUR, FORSCOM, and STRATCOM, as well as the 2nd Party CSG, Australian Theatre.<br>(S//SI) Mr. Charlie Meals, Deputy SIGINT Director, kicked off the conference with an overview of<br>Transformation 2.0/Extended Enterprise Governance. He highlighted how CSGs are making a<br>difference every day and used as an example a story about a CSG'er forward-deployed to the<br>Philippines to support US troops who were working with the Phillipine military. The CSG'er,<br>along with analysts at KRSOC*, realized that there was a threat to a US commander, made the<br>commander aware of the threat, and prevented the attack. Another example told how key<br>SIGINT contributions made by CSG Key West assists drug busts made weekly.<br>(S//SI) Mr. Meals explained that of the petals atop the Transformation pyramid, CSGs belong to<br>petals 3 and 4, Collaboration within the IC *, and Information sharing with clients/customers .<br>NSA needs to know what clients/customers want. Case in point, during Operation Iraqi Freedom<br>(OIF) NSA collaborated bilaterally with customers and was heavily embedded in the decision<br>making process, sharing significant amounts of information. He stressed that Transformation 2.0<br>is about maximizing SIGINT. To give the biggest bang for the buck, we have changed the way<br>we do things.<br>(S//SI) NSA has traditionally always kept cards close to the vest. We now want to share relevant<br>information with those who need to see it. Let clients decide where they need data from, not us<br>deciding where they should come in, and then provide that data at the "Earliest Point of<br>Consumability." Even bring Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from other agencies into our system<br>who have expertise that we don't have, let them troll through SIGINT and find what we don't<br>know is there.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Meal's presentation was followed by two days of individual CSG briefings from<br>OCONUS*, CONUS, and local CSG chiefs and representatives. The CSG briefings addressed<br>successes, challenges, and the impact of Transformation 2.0 on current operations and support<br>to the customer. On days three and four, current NSAW initiatives and relevant familiarization<br>training, tours, roundtables, and briefings were conducted. The recurring themes of the<br>conference were manning and IT* challenges, to include personnel staffing and training, UNIX to<br>NT migration, and telephony upgrades. The conference identified clear opportunities for<br>increased collaboration, improved focus on the challenges, and the definitive steps for the way<br>forward. The conference was a major success and opportunity to reinvigorate worldwide CSG<br>support.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>KRSOC = Kunia Regional Security Operations Center <br>IC = Intelligence Community <br><br> </p>OCONUS = Outside the Continental U.S. <br>IT = Information Technology <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
