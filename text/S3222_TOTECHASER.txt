TOTECHASER

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL) TOTECHASER is a Windows CE implant targeting the Thuraya 2520
handset. The Thuraya 2520 is a dual mode phone that can operate either in SAT or
GSM modes. The phone also supports a GPRS data connection for Web browsing,
e-mail, and MMS messages. The initial software implant capabilities include
providing GPS and GSM geo-location information. Call log, contact list, and other
user information can also be retrieved from the phone. Additional capabilities are
being investigated.

(U//FOUO) TOTECHASER - Operational Schematic

(TS//SI//REL) TOTECHASER will use SMS messaging for the command, control,
and data exfiltration path. The initial capability will use covert SMS messages to
communicate with the handset. These covert messages can be transmitted in
either Thuraya Satellite mode or GSM mode and will not alert the user of this
activity. An alternate command and control channel using the GPRS data
connection based on the TOTEGHOSTLY implant is intended for a future version.

(TS//SI//REL) Prior to deployment, the TOTECHASER handsets must be modified.
Details of how the phone is modified are being developed. A remotely deployable
TOTECHASER implant is being investigated. The TOTECHASER system consists
of the modified target handsets and a collection system.

(TS//SI//REL) TOTECHASER will accept configuration parameters to determine
how the implant operates. Configuration parameters will determine what information
is recorded, when to collect that information, and when the information is exfiltrated.
The configuration parameters can be set upon initial deployment and updated
remotely.
