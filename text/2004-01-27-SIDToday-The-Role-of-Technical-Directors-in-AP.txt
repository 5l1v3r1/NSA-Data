Members comprise:<br>Jack Israel<br>Donna Rober<br>Fran Fleisch<br><br>(U//FOUO) The basic tasks and deliverables for the team are as follows:<br>1.  Describe the duties, responsibilities, and outputs of Technical Directors. The goal is to<br>identify which are applicable across Production Line's and Production Service equivalents.<br>2.  Identify what, if any, additional roles/responsibilities would be inappropriate.<br>3.  Describe the authorities for Technical Directors.<br>4.  Review the draft Technical Leadership Council Charter for consistency with team's views<br>on Technical Directors.<br>5.  Outline the qualifications, selection process, expected duration of term, and notional<br>follow-on assignments for Technical Directors.<br>(U//FOUO) This is to be something of a clean-sheet exercise, and will include work done<br>previously by many thoughtful people. Nothing is off-limits to the group in coming to a workable<br>solution, and I expect several new ideas will surface. I don't expect TD's in different<br>organizations to be uniform, but the title should imply a common core. Although we are focused<br>on senior TD's initially, I hope that the results will help us with issues affecting technical experts<br>throughout the organization.<br>(U//FOUO) The team will present their results to me on 28 January and to the A&amp;P Senior<br>Leadership Team on 29 January. I'll keep you informed.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
