(U.S. Foreign and Security Policy Challenges in Africa) will examine some of the key issues for
Sub-Saharan Africa and for U.S. diplomacy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The involvement of external
players - including Europe, Nordic countries, Brazil, Iran, India, and China - will be discussed, as
will the topics of corruption, the impact of the Millenium Challenge Account, and the vitality of
NEPAD (the New Partnership for African Development). South Africa will be addressed in
particular, focusing on AIDS and the economy. Nigeria will likewise be a country of focus.
(U//FOUO) The seminar will also address terrorism in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the impact
of Wahabism and Islamic fundamentalism. The ways in which several African regions form
"insecurity communities" making conflicts easy to initiate, difficult to terminate, and a breeding
ground for transnational problems will also be discussed.
(C) Academic speakers include a former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, a former
Ambassador to several African nations, and several recognized experts on Africa. The
Government speakers include the current National Intelligence Officer for Africa on the National
