Outline

-	Two separate prototypes - FLYING PIG and HUSH
PUPPY

-	Both are cloud analytics which work on bulk unselected
data

-	FLYING PIG is a knowledge base for investigating TLS/
SSL traffic

-	HUSH PUPPY is a tool for attributing private network
traffic

FLYING PIG - TLS/SSL Background

-	TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer)
provides encrypted communication over the internet

-	Simple TLS/SSL handshake:

Motivations for FLYING PIG

More and more services used by GCHQ targets are moving to TLS/SSL to
increase user confidence, e.g. Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, etc.

Terrorists and cyber criminals are common users of TLS/SSL to hide their
comms (not necessarily using the big providers).

A TLS/SSL knowledge base could provide a means to extract as much
information from the unencrypted traffic as possible.

FLYING PIG implementation

Federated QFD approach

-	Multiple separate cloud analytics, each of which produce a QFD (Query
Focussed Dataset).

-	Analytics are run once a week, on approximately 20 billion events.

-	A single query in the web interface results in calls to multiple QFDs,
which are returned to the user in separate panels.

-	Results in:

(a)	fast queries,

(b)	easy-to-maintain modular code, and importantly

(c)	easy to add future TLS/SSL QFDs.

How the attack was done:

• Diginotar certificate
authority compromise:

-	Private keys of legitimate certificate
authority, Diginotar, stolen by
hacker.

-	FLYING PIG was used to identify a
FIS using them to launch a MITM
against their own citizens.

Cyber applications

• Other Cyber applications:

-	Multiple examples of FIS data exfiltration using SSL have been found using
FLYING PIG.

-	In particular, certificates related to LEGION JADE, LEGION RUBY, and
MAKERSMARK activity were found on FLYING PIG using known signatures

-	These were then used to find previously unknown servers involved in
exfiltration from US companies.

-	FLYING PIG has also been used to identify events involving a mail server used
by Russian Intelligence.

Identification of malicious TLS/SSL

•	Can identify malicious TLS/SSL using signatures if known

•	However this approach generally does not allow discovery of new threats

•	Alternative is to use “behavioural” features to automatically identify potentially
malicious traffic

•	Features currently being investigated include:

-	Certificates with same subject but different issuers - may be indicative of
Diginotar-style attack

-	Beaconing in TLS/SSL (indicative of botnets/FIS implants)

-	Number of client cipher suites offered

-	Repeated identical random challenges

HUSH PUPPY - motivation

•	Much private network traffic seen but previously discarded

•	If traffic could be attributed, potential high value - close access

•	HUSH PUPPY is a bulk private network identification Cloud analytic

•	Basic idea is to look for the same TDI being seen coming from a
private address and then from a public address within a short time

•	The private traffic can then be attributed to the owner of the public
address

•	Works for SSE & COMSAT

Other HUSH PUPPY datasets

•	HUSH PUPPY also makes use of Yahoo T-cookies to do correlations

•	A T-cookie contains the IP address of the client as Yahoo sees it

•	Hence a T cookie coming from a private IP can give the public IP of the
NAT or proxy

•	In addition, HUSH PUPPY uses the following data to help verify results

•	Kerberos & Lotus Notes: Domains, organisations, departments, countries,
machine names, user names

•	HTTP: Heuristic detection of Intranet web servers

Results - what do we find?

•	Foreign government networks

•	Airlines

•	Energy companies

•	Financial organisations

•	In cases of good collection, 50-80% of collected private network
traffic has been attributed

•	Some false positives can arise if few events correlated, due to factors
such as TDIs not being completely unique and public internet proxies
giving misleading public IP results

•	Results can frequently be verified using Kerberos etc data

Examples of operational successes

•	A large private network related to the Afghan government was
identified, with -800,000 events correlated.

•	Examination of the case notations suggested it belonged to the
Afghan MOD

-	A Kerberos domain mod.local

-	HTTP servers *.mod.local & mail

-	SSL certificates with the subject “Ministry of Defense” and the geo “AF”

•	Results confirmed by analysis of content on XKEYSCORE

•	A VSAT private network belonging to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
