In attendance were<br>managers, technical directors, stakeholders and decision-makers from the Five-eyes<br>government community, to include NRO*, CIA, SCEs** and field site elements, access providers<br>and industry partners. The purpose of the conference was to provide a foundation for community<br>collaboration based on a shared understanding of architectures, strategies and processes.<br>(U//FOUO) Almost 300 people attended all or parts of the conference. Subject matter experts<br>briefed and led discussions on the current state of P&amp;E, strategies and plans for current and<br>future endeavors, and collaboration among the partners. Panel discussions during the general<br>conference conveyed the vision and strategy for the future of SIGINT processing and exploitation<br>and outlined a roadmap for implementing that strategy. An executive session on the fourth day<br>of the conference established a governance structure and a process for collaboration and<br>decision-making.<br>(U//FOUO) Specific objectives for the conference were to establish an agreed-upon baseline,<br>develop strategic goals, establish governance and oversight, and to establish a collaborative<br>environment using a web-based tool for strategies, governance and capabilities development.<br>These objectives were met not only from NSA's perspective, but those of the 5-eyes and NRO<br>partners. Specifically, the conference:<br>1.  Provided an open forum for discussion of partner's P&amp;E strategies including architectures<br>and plans for the P&amp;E zone, major interfaces, and data formats.<br>2.  Illustrated major P&amp;E dependencies and integration strategies with access providers:<br>TRAILBLAZER<br>TDP (Technology Demonstration Platform)<br>EITC (Enterprise Information Technology Center).<br>3.  Communicated the current state of technology for the provisioning of P&amp;E services and<br>the existence of specialized P&amp;E solutions.<br>4.  Outlined the current state and needs for P&amp;E status reporting and monitoring for<br>command, control and situational awareness.<br>5.  Introduced the environment that will be used for P&amp;E collaboration, notably the<br>Processing and Exploitation Portal for supporting the Exploitation Community Process<br>(ECP), "go ecp".<br>6.  Communicated primary research priorities for P&amp;E along with existing research and<br>potential for solutions coming from ongoing R&amp;D activities.<br>7.  Provided an impetus for the immediate collaborative pursuit of challenges associated with<br>the convergence of plaintext and encryption processing into the enterprise P&amp;E<br>architecture.<br>8.  Established that P&amp;E solutions in the tactical environment are nodes on our SIGINT<br>Extended Enterprise network, and how the P&amp;E community plans to merge the traditional<br>lines dividing national and tactical environments.<br>(U//FOUO)) Preliminary feedback from conference attendees has been extremely positive. The<br>true measure of its success, and the commitment to collaboration in capabilities development,<br>will be monitored by the P&amp;E Steering Group established by senior representatives during the<br>Executive Session.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information about the conference, for briefing summaries and slides and for<br>the minutes of the executive session, please type "go peconf" on your browser  .<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) Notes: <br>*NRO = National Reconnaissance Office <br>**SCE = Service Cryptologic Element <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
