How can I "save off" XKS data?

• Content that is "interesting" can be pulled
out of X-KEYSCORE and pushed to Agility
or PINWALE or any other database for
longer retention

•	Workflows can be set up to automatically
harvest content out of XKS before it ages
off

•	The goal, however, is to use X-KEYSCORE
to discover new things, that will end up on
tasking for future collection
