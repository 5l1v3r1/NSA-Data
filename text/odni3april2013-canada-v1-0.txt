Subject:	(U//FOUO) NSA Intelligence Relationship with Canada’s

Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC)

(U) Introduction

(U//FOUO) The U.S.-Canada SIGINT relationship dates back to an alliance formed during World
War II. In 1949, the relationship was formalized under the CANUSA Agreement signed with
CSEC. The basic tenet of CANUSA is cooperation in all aspects of SIGINT except when
considered prejudicial to the national interests of one of the parties. The formal Information
Assurance (IA) relationship with CSEC is based on a 1986 Memorandum of Agreement. NSA
has a close, cooperative relationship with CSEC that both sides would like to see expanded and
strengthened.

(S//REL TO USA, CAN)) CSEC is a highly valued second party partner. The relationship is
driven by our mutual interest in the defense of North America as a whole. Cooperative efforts
include the exchange of liaison officers and integrees, joint projects, shared activities and a
strong desire for closer collaboration in the area of cyber defense. Since Canada has a limited
ability to produce cryptographic devices, it is a large consumer of U.S. IA products.
