I frequented many shops in Islamabad where<br>you could buy everything from Persian carpets, glass bracelets,<br>spice boxes, and hand-carved woodwork to the very latest<br>American DVDs, which were all at considerably lower prices.

The Marriott Hotel<br>alone had five restaurants that included Chinese, Japanese, and<br>Thai cuisine. There was even a Pizza Hut and ice cream parlor that<br>served food comparable to that found in the US. It's definitely one<br>of the few places I've been to where you can get a steak dinner<br>with two side dishes for about $4.00, although its inevitable that<br>you will eventually get sick no matter where you choose to eat.<br>(U//FOUO) Additionally, I wanted to share a few of the more<br>memorable experiences I had during my TDY:<br>Visiting the neighboring town of Taxila and getting a flat tire<br>that we had to change in a crowded parking lot.<br>Touring Murree and riding on a probably-not-so-safe<br>chairlift down the side of a mountain.<br>Riding on a camel in a very decrepit, run-down zoo, which<br>charged an admission price of around $.10.<br>Going running almost every day at 13:00, in 100-120<br>degree heat, with everyone I pass yelling that I'm<br>absolutely crazy to be doing anything outside.<br>Eating dinner at the "Chicken Shack," which requires<br>considerable faith in both the drive up the winding road and<br>the cooking.<br>Haggling over the price of something already cheap, with<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Intern TDYs <br>1.
