Retrieving Metadata and Content

■ Queries complete but there are no results.

•	If queries complete, but no results are visible,
verify that the date range of the query coincides
with the collection date of the data. If using test
data, test the query system by putting the start
date range at a year or two older to assure it is not
old test data.

•	Verify that query metadata is in the query
database by checking the contents of the
/export/data/xkeyscore/mysq!/{query_db}/
directory.
