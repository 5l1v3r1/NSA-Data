Here's one from<br><br>(S//SI//REL) At a location where the F6 daily "local support" folder<br>for the Embassy leadership included untranslated<br>counterterrorism-related reports and drug lord transcriptions (the<br>latter often included such colorful language that even a native<br>speaker might stumble over some of the phrases), I was<br>summoned one day to the Ambassador's office to answer some<br>questions.<br>(S//SI//REL) The Ambassador, a highly sophisticated, educated and<br>well-known New York lawyer who prided himself on his knowledge<br>of the local language, called his Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and<br>me into his office and closed the door. Given the dangerous<br>terrorism situation in the country -- terrorists had just blown the<br>entire front off of our Embassy the week before -- I was sure that I<br>was about to hear about the most serious threat yet and sat poised<br>on the edge of a chair, notepad at the ready.<br>(U//FOUO) The Ambassador turned to me and asked <br> how<br>do you translate ((long string of foreign-language expletives))?"<br>Well, my tested proficiency in even the polite form of the language<br>was only 3/3, but I could sort out enough of the drift of the<br>expletives to be rendered totally speechless. Rather than belt out<br>to our dapper, distinguished Ambassador a long string of words<br>more unsavory than most have ever heard, I told him I had no<br>idea; such reporting wasn't, after all, my specialty, and this was<br>pretty esoteric language.<br>(U//FOUO) The Ambassador then turned to his deputy and<br>repeated the question. The DCM, a very polished yet wonderfully<br>down-to-earth and dutiful man, was as stunned as I and was silent.<br>His face started to redden, and after about half a minute, the<br>Ambassador asked him again more sternly, since he knew that the<br>DCM was fluent in the language. Well, perfect deputy as he was<br>when questioned by his boss, he eventually took a deep breath and<br>let fly with a perfect translation into English. The Ambassador<br>leaned back, grinned and said, "I thought that's what it meant!"<br>(U//FOUO) Moral: interagency collaboration is truly rewarding,<br>though at times the subjects are unspeakable...<br>(U//FOUO) See other editions of InSIDer's View of History :<br>A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.
