(U)<br>(U//FOUO) Last week, SIGINT leaders flew in from around the world to attend the annual<br>SIGINT Site Commanders Operational Review here at Fort Meade. This year's SCOR conference<br>focused on how we are to govern the global SIGINT network in the 21st century. It went very<br>well. It gave Extended Enterprise leaders the opportunity to look into the complexities of the<br>task facing us, and allowed them to participate in designing solutions.<br>(U//FOUO) We didn't come out with a finished plan, but we did gain an appreciation for the<br>biggest component of this transformation: our behavior as an organization. That is to say, how<br>will we interact which each other so that we have the right people doing the mission in the most<br>efficient way? This goes beyond flow charts and mission and function statements!<br>(U//FOUO) During the conference, it became clear that we must become a net-centric<br>organization -- an organization that is truly a network of collaborative partners instead of one<br>based strictly on traditional hierarchies or a hub-spoke structure. The capstones of a net-centric<br>organization are transparency and collaboration .<br>(U//FOUO) (U//FOUO) We need a transparent network to show all of the SIGINT players what all<br>of the other players are doing. In the military, this is called a Common Operating Picture (COP).<br>In order to create such an environment, we must first invest in our future infrastructure. A few<br>points:<br>Some elements of this infrastructure already exist, some are being built, and others are<br>part of long-term acquisition programs.<br>We will not wait until all of the pieces are in place to start using them.<br>Users will help develop the tools they need.<br>The infrastructure will require oversight, but the oversight will be facilitative and<br>supportive rather than directive. We will set the basic environment, and let the COP grow<br>over time. You can think of this as an "Internet model" for our global networks.<br>All SIGINTers will be able to participate.<br>(U//FOUO) The investment in our infrastructure will also create an environment that will enable<br>and foster the second capstone of a net-centric operating environment -- an environment of<br>collaboration. Collaboration in this sense is not limited to analysis, but on governance and<br>decision-making as well. We want everyone to be able to work together in a push-pull manner<br>across the global enterprise to make the right individual and corporate decisions on how best to<br>produce SIGINT. We will aim for good decision-making throughout the system, not a top-down<br>approach, and intend to create collaborative environments to allow this to happen. Of course,<br>the SIGINT leadership will be responsible for making decisions to resolve issues when conflicts<br>arise -- but top-level involvement will be the exception rather than the norm.<br>(U//FOUO) There will be more on our SCOR observations in my next article. Meanwhile, continue<br>your great work and your great teamwork!<br>(U//FOUO) To see MG Quirk's briefing on governance delivered at the SCOR Conference, go to<br>.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
