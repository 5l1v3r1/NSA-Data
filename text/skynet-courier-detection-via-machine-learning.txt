Given a handful of courier selectors, can we find others
that “behave similarly” by analyzing GSM metadata?

It’s worth noting that:

•	we are looking for
different people using
phones in similar ways

•	without using any call
chaining techniques
from known selectors

•	by scanning through
all selectors seen in
Pakistan that have not
left Af/Pak (~55M)

Now, we’ll describe a cross validation experiment
on the AQSL selectors that we were provided

Cross Validation Experiment
on AQSL Couriers

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

Our initial detector uses the centroid of the AQSL
couriers to “find other selectors like these”

AQSL Cross-Validation

Experiment

•	7 MSISDN/IMSI pairs

•	Hold each pair out
and score them when
training the centroid
on the rest

•	Assume that random
draws of Pakistani
selectors are
nontargets

•	How well do we do?

Our initial detector uses the centroid of the AQSL

AQSL Cross-Validation

Experiment

•	Initial experiments
showed EER in
10-20% range

•	Here, performance is
much worse again st
these nontargets:

•	Seen in Pakistan

•	Not seen outside of
Af/Pak

•	Not FVEY selectors

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

Statistical algorithms are able to find the couriers at very
low false alarm rates, if we’re allowed to miss half of them

Random Forest
Classifier

•	7 MSISDN/IMSI pairs

•	Hold each pair out and
then try to find them after
learning how to distinguish
remaining couriers fro n
other Pakistanis

(using 100k random selectors here)

•	Assume that random
draws of Pakistani
selectors are nontargets

•	0.18% False Alarm Rate at
50% Miss Rate

To get more training data we scraped selectors from S2I11
Anchory reports containing keyword “courier”

Anchory Selectors

•	Searched for reports
containing “S2I11”

AND “courier”

•	Filtered out non-mobile
numbers and kept
selectors with
“interesting” travel
patterns seen in
SmartTracker

Adding selectors from Anchory reports to the training data
reduced the false alarm rates even further

Now, we’ll investigate some findings after running these
classifiers on +55M Pakistani selectors via MapReduce

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

Preliminary results indicate that we’re on the
right track, but much remains to ue acme

Cross Validation Experiment:

-	Random Forest classifier operating at
0.18% false alarm rate at 50% miss

-	Enhancing training data with Anchory
selectors reduced that to 0.008%

-	Mean Reciprocal Rank is ~1/10

Preliminary SIGINT Findings:

-	Behavioral features helped discover
similar selectors with “courier-like”
travel patterns

-	High number of tasked selectors at
the top is hopefully indicative of the
detector performing well “in the wild”
