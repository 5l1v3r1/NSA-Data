The Problem

SIGINT is very good at 2 things:

1.	Establishing lists of potential leads (50-10k+)

2.	Manual analysis to vet individual targets

Triage Today

After initial enrichment checks, the analyst is often
left with too many identifiers of "possible interest"

Bulk Lead Triage via Behavior Analytics

Hundreds or thousands of selectors to go through high level vetting very quickly

Better triage prioritization allows for highly adjustable thresholds to be set for
follow -on analysis

Compliance can be inserted at both the "batch result" and "query" level
Potentially utilize multiple clouds & cross-enterprise analytics
