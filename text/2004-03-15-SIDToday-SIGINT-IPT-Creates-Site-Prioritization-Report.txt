This Site Prioritization Report, put together by the SIGINT<br>Integrated Product Team and coordinated and approved by the SID Executive Leadership Board<br>(ELB) and external field elements, contains information that will be used as guidance for the<br>deployment of transformational capabilities. The report is a dynamic document that will be<br>updated on a periodic basis.<br>(U//FOUO) The report cannot be posted on NSAnet due to classification issues, but if you would<br>like a copy, contact<br> at<br>nsa. He will email you a copy PKI-encrypted.<br>(U//FOUO) The Site Prioritization Report is a detailed, comprehensive report containing over 350<br>pages (those interested in the bottom line should refer to Section 3, Prioritization Results, pages<br>30-38). The report describes the processes the IPT used to develop the site lists along with "as<br>is" and "to be" prioritized lists of sites. The report appendices provide additional information on<br>the contributions of the sites along with integrated site lists based on the topics of terrorism and<br>Trailblazer.<br>(S//SI) The report prioritizes sites within their respective access types, which were grouped into<br>five broad categories that align with the SID budget structure:<br>HF/Tactical<br>Overhead<br>FORNSAT<br>SCS<br>Cable/End Point<br>(U) Background<br>(U//FOUO) In July 2003 the SID ELB initiated a two-phase effort to conduct studies to provide<br>SID leadership with information to make decisions related to transformation. The Phase I team<br>produced a list of mission priorities based on the National Intelligence Priorities Framework<br>(NIPF). The Phase II integrated product team (IPT) used the mission priorities output from<br>Phase I and combined it with other available input (e.g. strategic plans, reporting statistics,<br>deployment plans, etc.) to create a comprehensive report recommending the proposed<br>prioritization of sites for deployment of future SIGINT system capabilities.<br>(U//FOUO) The Phase II effort began in August, and in just 60 days, the IPT researched,<br>evaluated and synthesized information from numerous sources to create their recommendations.<br>The IPT used information such as mission priorities, strategic plans, reporting statistics, and<br>deployment plans, as well as site tasking and capabilities, site manning and skill mix, and<br>dependencies between the sites. The team combined this disparate information into an<br>extensive set of data, which they meticulously analyzed to form their final recommendations for<br>the prioritized lists of sites.<br>(U//FOUO) At the completion of the study the IPT co-leads briefed the results to the SID ELB.<br>The results were very favorably received and the team was directed to document the results in a<br>report. Further, the ELB agreed with the IPT's recommendation to update the site prioritization<br>on a regular basis and the Chief of S2 volunteered his organization to perform this task in the<br>future.<br><br> </p>(U//FOUO) The Site Prioritization IPT was co-led by <br>S01R and had the following members:<br><br>from S01A and <br><br> from<br><br>(Trailblazer)<br>Kevan Barton (S01R)<br>Frank Cawley (CNSG)<br> (AFCO)<br> (CNSG)<br> (Trailblazer)<br>(CSRC)<br> (S01X)<br> (S01X)<br>Liz Mossberg (SigDev)<br>(LASEO)<br>Jim Roser (S3331)<br> (LASEO)<br> (S2094)<br> (ITIS)<br>(S17)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
