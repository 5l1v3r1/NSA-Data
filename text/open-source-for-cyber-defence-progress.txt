Paslebin	An increasing number of lip-offs are coming from lhe Paslebin websile, as lhis is where many hackers anonymously advertise and promole lheir exploils, by publishing slolen information. An aulomaled, regular search (say, weekly) across Paslebin for certain keywords such as .gov.uk or GSI or HMG elc. would be very valuable lo ensure lhal GovCerlUK is always notified if any information lhal lhey need lo be concerned aboul appears in open source. ”30-11-201 1 GovCerlUK briefed aboul an allack on a UN server.
