This<br>incident began when a CSG COMINT watchstander analyzed incoming counter-narcotics reports<br>and concluded that it was possible to positively identify and locate the drug-laden ship. The CSG<br>quickly tipped the Coast Guard, who ordered the cutter Boutwell to turn around and speed to<br>the area of activity in the Eastern Pacific.<br>(C//SI) When the crew of the Boutwell arrived in the area, they found two fishing boats ... which<br>was the "right" one? The watchstander again correctly analyzed the situation and advised the<br>Coast Guard as to which of the two boats was carrying the drugs. Upon boarding, USCG<br>personnel found the cocaine still on the boat's deck and in the cabin. Their confidence in the<br>SIGINT reporting and analysis was well rewarded!<br>(C//SI) So far this year, SANDKEY** counter-narcotics reporting has directly resulted in the<br>seizure of 16 metric tons of cocaine, which represents more than half of the amount seized<br>during all of last year based on this source. The entire SANDKEY community should be applauded<br>for their great work.<br>(S//SI) Besides the above bust, NSA advance warning of an impending Colombia-Brazil armsfor-drugs shipment the same weekend allowed JIATF-S (Joint Inter-Agency Task Force - South,<br>in Key West) analysts to track an aircraft and provide the information to the Colombian Air<br>Force. As a result, the Colombians were able to destroy the returning aircraft on the ground<br>under the conditions of the Air Bridge Denial Program. This was the second aircraft in as many<br>weeks destroyed because of such radar correlation to SIGINT products.<br>(S//SI) In addition, last month's arrest of FARC (a Colombian insurgent group) financial leader<br>"Sonya" and a number of her associates resulted from years of monitoring her movements and<br>modus operandi. Accurate geolocational data as to where she was and when, allowed a vetted<br>Colombian team to capture them by surprise and without any loss of life.<br>(U) Well done to all involved!<br>**(C) SANDKEY is "plaintext, single-channel, nongovernmental radio communications of<br>international narcotics trafficking activities that have no reasonable expectation of privacy."<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
