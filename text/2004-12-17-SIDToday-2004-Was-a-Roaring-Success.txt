Our nation depends on our products<br>and services, today more than ever. In 2004, you delivered, rising to incredible challenges with<br>tremendous skill and dedication. It has taken each and every one of you, dedicating your<br>expertise and energy to the task and willingly supporting those on your left and right, to bring<br>about this success.<br>(U//FOUO) Meanwhile, throughout this demanding year, we have continued to transform<br>ourselves into a 21st century, network-centric enterprise. This enterprise enables unprecedented<br>collaboration and allows each of us more freedom in the execution of our duties. There's no<br>question, we have a long way to go -- but it is notable that we've made such progress while<br>simultaneously producing SIGINT of such great quantity and quality.<br>(U) Now is the time of year we celebrate our national and religious holidays, and it is important<br>that we do just that. Many of us, knowing the importance of our mission, are reluctant to take<br>time away from work, but we must take some time to reflect on all of the benefits we enjoy as<br>Americans. We have an extraordinary organization with great depth -- no one is indispensable.<br>Take a pause from manning the "gun emplacements" to spend time with family or friends. This<br>is an opportunity for you to rejuvenate, give thanks, and prepare for a busy year ahead -- it is<br>important to us that you do so.<br>(U) Next year, the war will continue and our challenges will increase, as will our opportunities.<br>Meanwhile, we'll continue down the transformational road as we build a more effective<br>organization that will also be a more rewarding place to work. Some will look at these challenges<br>as daunting, but this test is what brings us back every year. So that we may give it our best<br>next year, take a break this year. Very best wishes to you and your families this holiday season<br>and thank you again for helping to make the nation a safer place.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
