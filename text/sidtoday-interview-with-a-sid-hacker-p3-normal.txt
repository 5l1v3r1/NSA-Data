3. tu; iou ve spotten 01 some oi ine uesi aspects 01 tne jou. nat are ine worst
aspects?

(S//SI//REL) One negative would be the long hours that people in TAO need to work,
and the times arc often inconvenient. For example.analysts arc often working here
at midnight, because we have to work when our targets arc active. Also, in CT we arc
often on call, and might even be called in during holidays. Those are sacrifices you have
to be willing to make. Also.^|^^ Building [which is home to most of the TAO
workforce] isn't the best building. The cafeteria is relatively small and not open after-
hours, although they did add some vending machines recently with sandwiches and
wraps. The parking at m is somewhat better than tlie^^| however.

6. (U) What has been the most nerve-wracking moment of your career so far? ...the
greatest thrill?

(U//FOUO) I'd say they were the same event: the UBL takedown. I was brought in early
on. months in advance. I was told. "We think UBL is in this compound - how can you
help?" In the prep stages, one of the NSA primary' analysts was flown to Afghanistan
and even DIRNSA wras involved. During the actual raid [by Navy SEALS], the [TAO]
CT employees were all here on chat rooms following the events. When we heard that the
helicopter had crashed, tliat was a "Whao, wiiat just happened??" moment. Were lives
lost? Then when we heard "Jackpot!" there was a moment of great jubilation. It was
awesome! We w'ere all pleased that we could make a direct contribution to this success
-- something we will remember for the rest of our lives.**

7. (U) Is there anything else you think people should know about TAO?

(U//FOUO) I tliink a lot of people in SID don't fully understand what w'e can do — they
believe we arc focused only on a few' particular missions. But that's really not the case.
We are the technical experts on CNE [computer-network exploitation]. and we can apply
those skills to all missions — against every target that uses computer networks. So, I
hope people will keep in mind that w-e can support everyone.

(U) Notes:

* (U//FOUO) See a Tapioca Pebble on a related theme: "Best w>av to retain highly in-
demand tcclmical employees?"

** (U//FOUO)	related another thrilling event from his career at a SID town

hall meeting last year. You can see it in this video, starting at the 29:50 mark.)
