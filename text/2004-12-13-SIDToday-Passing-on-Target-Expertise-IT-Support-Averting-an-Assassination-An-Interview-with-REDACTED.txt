(U//FOUO)<br>What was your first job at the Agency? (U)<br>(TS//SI) I hired on as a Chinese linguist with the Golden Triangle Narcotics Team in late 1978. I<br>wasn't at work long before I had an exciting experience... One day I was handed some rather<br>garbled traffic to peruse for anything of interest. The intercept was from the narco-insurgent<br>Shan United Army. I noticed the words "mountaintop," "man," and "gun" in the traffic and<br>decided that something indeed must be happening!<br>(TS//SI) Further analysis showed that the insurgents were planning to shoot down a helicopter<br>carrying a U.S. congressional delegation on a fact-finding trip. This information was promptly<br>released as the first CRITIC* of 1979. I had just started my career and had played a role in<br>helping avert an assassination attempt! I can still recall the rush of adrenaline and the feeling of<br>doing something significant - I was hooked.<br>If you could change one thing at the Agency, what would it be? (U)<br>(C) We need to make healthy the IT support provided to our analysts. This is a fundamental part<br>of doing our jobs -- we at NSA need cutting-edge tools and functionality. We have not had any<br>catastrophic failures, but there has been a constant feeling of degradation of capabilities,<br>everything from website access to analytic tools that don't work on Agency standard PCs. What<br>we use at work must be better than what we have at home.<br>What is the most exciting project for the future that your organization is involved in? (U)<br>(S//SI) I believe the most important task facing us now is to make sure that our senior analysts,<br>before they retire, pass on their knowledge to the younger generation of analysts. Our Product<br>Line, International Security Issues, covers a range of topics, including Western European<br>targets, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and Follow-the-Money (FTM). The common denominator among<br>all these targets is that they deal with economic and diplomatic issues. I consider our expertise<br>on these topics to be a core competency for ISI, just as it is a core competency for NSA within<br>the Intelligence Community.<br>(S//SI) These are important issues: economic troubles are a major contributor to instability, and<br>much depends upon our nation's diplomatic relations. The FTM branch's motto is "Without<br>money, there is no jihad," so these even tie in with the War on Terror. It is absolutely critical<br>that our senior analysts, who have an amazing level of expertise on these matters, teach the<br>junior personnel what they know.<br>What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career? (U)<br>(S//SI) It's a toss-up. I was a branch chief in the China/Korea Product Line at the time of the<br>Tiananmen crisis of 1989, and had the opportunity to brief both the HPSCI and SSCI*<br>committees of Congress on the subject. This was a great privilege for someone at my grade<br>level! My branch also issued the very first video SIGINT report at that time.<br>(S//SI) My other "best experience" was working as the SINIO for East Asia in the early 1990's.<br>We provided support to policymakers regarding the US-North Korea Agreed Framework<br>negotiations, an attempt to avert a crisis on the Korean Peninsula.
