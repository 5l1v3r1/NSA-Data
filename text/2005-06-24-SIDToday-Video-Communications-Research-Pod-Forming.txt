(S//SI) Video Communications Research Pod Forming
FROM:
SIGDEV, Strategy and Governance (SSG)
Run Date: 06/24/2005

(S//SI) Do you use a camera cell phone? Do you use a camera with your home computer to
send video attachments to friends? Our targets use these types of communications, too! The
Video Communications Research (VCR) Pod will study image communications, both still and
moving images, with a focus at first on images from camera cell phones and video attachments
to e-mail.
(S//SI) The Pod will research how to best collect such video, investigate existing video
applications, study their codecs and features, investigate their usage by targets, analyze the
data flow process, and provide a means of presentation for the analyst and delivery of the
product to the customers. As more information is gained about video targets, this information
may also be applied to advancing the Agency's processing of other types of video
communications.
(U//FOUO) Pod 40 starts late July/early August 2005, and goes for 12-18 months. If you are
interested in this effort, please contact one of the Co-Leaders:
