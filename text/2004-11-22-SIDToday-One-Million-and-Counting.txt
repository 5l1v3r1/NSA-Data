One million dollars is a lot of money, especially when you consider<br>that it came from a relatively small population - NSA. The money donated will be used<br>throughout the country and the world in a variety of ways during the coming year. We should all<br>feel good about that and be very proud.<br>(U) One million dollars is a lot of money, however, our goal is $1.6 million. There are very few of<br>us in this building, or any building in the NSA complex, who have not benefited from one of the<br>organizations under the CFC umbrella. Admit it, no one stands alone in this world. No one can<br>do it all by themselves. No one should ever have to.<br>(U) That is why we are calling on you to help bring the totals up to the $1.6 million mark. SID's<br>portion of that total is almost 640,000. To date, we have donated $417,820.19 with a<br>participation rate of 11%. That 11% of the SID population has already given nearly 65% of our<br>goal is a testament to the generosity and largesse of those individuals. Thank you for your<br>donations.<br>(U) There are eight days left in the campaign. Certainly enough time to fill out a form on-line<br>and send it in. Let's bring up the numbers. Let's contact our CFC representative. Let's work<br>together, so that when Thanksgiving comes, we can all be thankful that the opportunity to give<br>is made so easy for us through the CFC.<br>(U) Combined, we produce the best SIGINT in the world. Combined, we protect the nation from<br>those that would do us harm. Combined, we can substantially make a difference in the world<br>through the CFC.<br>(U) You are one in a million point six!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
