Email Addresses Query:

One of the most common queries is (you guessed it) an Email Address Query searching
for an email address. To create a query for a specific email address, you have to fill in the
name of the query, justify it and set a date range then you simply fill in the email
address(es) you want to search on and submit.

That would look something like this...

NOTE: You DO NOT have to know an email address to use the Email Address Query.
You can also search on an IP address*, domain name**, country, port, cascnotation,
protocol, SIGAD, MAC address, PID and more. If you search on something other-than an
email address (e.g., an IP address), your results will be all of the email addresses seen on
those IPs.

* The IP must be hosted OUTSIDE 5-eyes countries

** The Domain MUST be foreign owned. Check WHOIS and NSLOOKUP for more info on your domain before-hund
