Operations

37.	The primary uses of BLACK HOLE for Operations are:

•	Run bulk queries on selectors, or geographical regions, or some other criteria,
to help assist Ops when they have a surge or crisis.

•	Try new bulk analysis ideas and apply existing statistical methods in order to
better understand data and develop analytical tools.

•	Understand the BLACK HOLE data and to use it to look for particular patterns
and behaviours for target discovery.

•	Bulk access/extraction to specific logs.

•	Monitor hits against various TDIs, both to inform the Protocol Prioritisation List
(PPL) and to ensure that TDIs remain up to date and relevant.

38.	For Operations BLACK HOLE use as described above, TDB-Events would expect

the following to occur:

•	A BLACK HOLE Manager role will govern the management and day to day
running of the BLACK HOLE. (See BLACK HOLE Manager Role for more
information, page 12.)

Crypt Target Discovery and SIGINT Development (OPC-TDSD)

39.	The primary uses of BLACK HOLE for Crypt Target Discovery and SIGINT

Development are:

•	Off-line processing of packets and/or events on BLACK HOLE, to generate
more (or enriched) events, which are put back into QFDs.

•	Test and add new “Crypt" QFDs into NGE environment. Note: All new QFDs
are be evaluated against each other, in terms of Operational benefit, to
determine its pull through priority onto the NGE environment.

•	Access Content (encrypted data samples) to aid research and capability
development plus target development, e.g. attempting to decrypt traffic
samples.

•	Access to crypt events to aid target discovery and target development

•	Monitor hits against target to inform PPL and future Crypt research and
capability development.

40.	For a new “crypt" QFD to be trialled on BLACK HOLE TDB-Events would expect

the same principals for the trialling of TR QFD to occur.

41.	In the long term future the following Crypt areas would be interested in BLACK

HOLE/QFDs:

•	OPC-CDP - Analytical interest.

•	OPC-CDP - Development of Crypt QFDs.
