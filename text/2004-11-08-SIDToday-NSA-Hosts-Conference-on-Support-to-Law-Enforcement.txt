This conference has the distinction of<br>being the first time that all five SIGINT partners met to discuss cryptanalytic support to<br>our law enforcement partners . In attendance were representatives from the general<br>counsel, policy, and cryptanalytic offices of CSE, DSD, GCHQ, GCSB, and NSA*. Law<br>Enforcement representation included the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Royal Canadian<br>Mounted Police (RCMP), and the UK's National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC). The shared<br>goal of the conference participants was to develop a true understanding of the needs of our LEA<br>and SIGINT partners.<br>(U//FOUO) The first two days involved briefings and discussions focused on legal guidelines and<br>authorities, law enforcement needs, and SIGINT partners' procedures for accepting and fulfilling<br>requests for technical assistance. The rest of the conference focused on discussions highlighting<br>equity-sharing concerns between the SIGINT partners and our LEA partners. While it was clear<br>that the SIGINT partners were interested in supporting our LEA partners, protecting our SIGINT<br>equities was an extremely important issue and discussions on how to protect those equities<br>followed. Through these open and frank discussions, it was very apparent that all partners go to<br>great lengths to protect our very important and most sensitive assets.<br>(C) As a result of the conference, the attendees agreed upon a mutual set of Guiding Principles<br>to shape and facilitate our relationship with the Law Enforcement Community. Ultimately, all<br>participants left the conference with a greater appreciation for each others commitment to<br>supporting law enforcement, confidence in our procedures to protect each others equities, and a<br>better understanding as to how the laws of each country works in that protection.<br>(U) Notes: <br>*CSE, DSD, GCHQ, and GCSB are the SIGINT agencies for Canada, Australia, the UK and New<br>Zealand, respectively. <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
