(U) Subject: NSA Intelligence Relationship with New Zealand

(U) Executive Summary

(U//FOUO) NSA’s relationship with New Zealand is supportive and cooperative. New
Zealand’s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) highly values its
relationship with NSA/CSS and will continue to seek and support mutually beneficial
efforts that demonstrate its commitment to national and international security through its
foreign partnerships, in spite of budget and other resource challenges.

(S//REL) GCSB is New Zealand’s operational lead on the cyber threat, giving it impetus
to be an active participant in the global tipping and cueing architecture as well as
resources and capabilities to contribute to Five Eyes efforts. GCSB continues to be
especially helpful in its ability to provide NSA ready access to areas and countries that
are difficult for the United States to access. Mr. Ian Fletcher, GCSB Director since
February 2012, faced his first major challenge when GCSB came under investigation for
allegedly exceeding its authority when assisting New Zealand law enforcement. The
review that followed made several recommendations, some already underway, to
strengthen GCSB’s compliance program.

(U) Key Issues

(S//REL) GCSB recently gained agreement to roll out a single TOP SECRET
network across the New Zealand government with all agencies' TOP SECRET
networks collapsing into a single domain. As part of a strategic decision to
collocate intelligence functions, the New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service
(NZSIS) will move into the new building recently occupied by GCSB with GCSB
providing the infrastructure support.

(U) What NSA Provides to Partner

(S//REL) NSA provides raw traffic, processing, and reporting on targets of mutual
interest, in addition to technical advice and equipment loans.

(U) What Partner Provides to NSA

(TS//SI//REL) GCSB provides collection on China, Japanese/North
KoreanA/ietnamese/South American diplomatic communications, South Pacific Island
nations, Pakistan, India, Iran, and Antarctica; as well as, French police and nuclear
testing activities in New Caledonia. GCSB has been the lead for the Intelligence
Community on the Bangladesh counterterrorism (CT) target since 2004.

(U) Success Stories

(S//SI//REL) GCSB's Bangladesh CT reporting provided unique intelligence leads that
have enabled successful CT operations by Bangladesh State Intelligence Service, CIA
and India over the past year. GCSB reporting on CT targets in Bangladesh was one of
the key SIGINT sources	reporting to the U.S. Intelligence

Community.

(S//REL) GCSB is a charter member of SIGINT Seniors Pacific (SSPAC)2, a group
comprising national SIGINT agency leaders from ten countries with interests in the
Pacific Region. GCSB completed its 2-year term as chair of both the SSPAC Executive
Board and Analytic Working Group in 2012. During its tenure, GCSB secured active
participation in the forum from previously silent partners, garnered unprecedented high
levels of participation in analytic synchronization sessions, and secured a relationship
between SSPAC and SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR)3.

(U) Problems/Challenges with the Partner

(S//REL) GCSB continues to focus and invest its limited resources on the highest
New Zealand national priorities, with the recent compliance review consuming
much of its resources and attention over the past six months. GCSB's highest
priority, cyber, will be developed to meet the demands of the New Zealand
government and Five Eyes partners. NSA will continue to encourage GCSB’s
efforts towards technical interoperability.
