What is TOR?

•	“The Onion Router”

•	Hides source of traffic by passing encrypted
versions of your internet traffic between multiple
TOR routers

•	Notation:

-	“Client” - the initiator of communication

-	“Guard node” - the TOR router the client contacts

-	“Exit node” - the TOR router that relays your traffic to
the final destination (with no extra encryption so this
link can be exploited by SIGINT system)

Who uses TOR?

•	TOR was created by the US government and is
now maintained by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF)

•	EFF will tell you there are many pseudo-legitimate
uses for TOR

•	We’re interested as bad people use TOR, in
particular:

-	Terrorists

-	Paedophiles

Aim

•	Find client IP address associated with TOR
exit node traffic

•	Attack based on externals - specifically packet
timings

- Strong crypt is being used

Aim

• We’ll make our task easier by assuming we own
the exit node being used

-	Allows us to see all the traffic associated with a TOR
circuit

-	Demultiplex traffic by (unknown) user

Side note: Circuit tracing

•	One suggestion was to track packets through each
hop in the TOR network

•	We experimented with spotting all links in circuits
created by GCHQ

•	Visibility was too low to be a sensible approach

-	13 out of 8294 potential inter-TOR-router links were seen

•	We will directly correlate:

-	exit node traffic, and

-	traffic between client and guard node

Test data collection

•	Used the standard “TOR button” web-browser
package to access TOR

•	Made minor changes to ensure we could collect exit
node traffic

1.	“News”: Search for news, visit news websites

2.	“TOR": Browse the TOR website and then use a privacy
checking website

• Split into 2a and 2b as TOR changed circuit mid-way through

1.	“Download”: visit to SlashDot followed by downloading a
large PDF file.

2.	“Forum”: Search on Google followed by browsing a PC
technical help forum.

Flattening of timing patterns

•	^^■(ICTR-NE) observed that TOR can
flatten out timing patterns

•	TOR uses a rate-limiting store-and-forward
procedure at each TOR router

•	Graph shows bytes of exit node traffic in green
and client traffic in red whilst downloading a 1MB
file (figure from

Cumulative packet counts

Exit

Guard

•	Our new insight is to
use cumulative packet
counts

•	Hope packets are
approximately
preserved

- Approximate as TOR
repacketises data

•	See strong correlation

Scoring: basic idea

•	An idea of

-	Bin time into intervals

-	For each interval get a pair (E,, G)

•	Cumulative exit node packets upto time i

•	Cumulative guard node packets upto time i

-	Measure the correlation between these pairs

•	We use Is time-windows

-	Easy for the SIGINT system

-	Seems to work

Scoring: refinements

• We also expect counts to be similar

-	Fit a linear model

. Gi = a+pEi

-	Only accept sessions where Vz < |3< 2

Scoring: refinements

• There may be an unknown time-offset

-	Traffic takes time to relay through the TOR network

-	SIGINT clocks may not be synchronised

-	We slide the traces against each other and find the best
match

-	Truncate to exit node trace (we know that it is a
complete TOR circuit)

False positives

•	Want an algorithm with very low false positive rate

•	Used 2 hours of (timestamp, source IP, destination
IP) tuples captured from 4 10G internet bearers

•	Filtered to tuples between a guard node and a non-
TOR node

•	Allow time to arbitrarily slide +/- 2 hours

- In real redeployment one would restrict this slide

•	Allow us to plot ROC curves for the technique

False positives

•	Linear - log ROC curve plot

•	Server-to-client good

-	We miss the very short “2a”
session with no false-positives

-	Threshold r2=0.998

False positive rate
Client to server

• Client-to-server direction -
many false positives

- There’s less structure in data as
less data flows in this direction
when web-browsing

A larger experiment

•	We want to find some false hits to understand worst
case accuracy for the server-to-client direction

•	Let’s open the aperture very wide

-	2027 bearer hours of logs with any time slide

-	Filter to all traffic involving a TOR node

• Not just likely guard-to-client traffic as before

•	We find some false hits (540) but rate is assessed
to be low enough.

•	92% of false hits are against the big download
session which has little structure

The next step

•	We are collecting the required logs of packet
times with TOR guard nodes in SIGINT

•	GTE / JTRIG have adapted some TOR exit nodes
we own to collect the required exit node data

-	We are keen to engage with others with exit nodes too

•	Then run the attack

-	Expect to basically work

-	Some extra work might be required to only allow
queries on sessions with enough structure

• Need the bulk data first to progress this question

R package

• Includes algorithm and the collected web-browsing
data

• Recommend R packages for sharing analytics, can
contain:

-	R / C / Fortran code

-	Example data

-	Runnable examples and documentation

-	Unit tests

Conclusion

•	Have shown a potential externals-based
deanonymisation attack for TOR

-	Requires SIGINT collection of guard-to-client packet
times

-	Requires TOR collection from exit nodes we own

•	Hope to get this running live at GCHQ soon
