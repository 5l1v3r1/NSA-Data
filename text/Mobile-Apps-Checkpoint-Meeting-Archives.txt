Present:

Mobile TERRAIN

•	Yahoo protocol change confirmed - App no longer able to process it.

•	Tunnel timeout fix unproven. Evaluation awaiting restoration of service.

•	Survey enhancement - in TERRAIN 10.5, comprises additional logging.	to evaluate.

•	Feedback mechanism for issues found during Mobile IV&V was discussed. Feedback to TPS to be informal: TPS will

raise internal tasks as necessary,	will then track via weekly internal reports. Service Desk will not be necessary.

•	The recent security incident, in which PDDGs, SIGADs and protective markings were wrongly configured, highlights the

need for formal system ownership and support. Current MVR HB planning indicates that Mobile TERRAIN will be
needed for at least 8 months and probably longer. The PRESTON rollout process by TFE was discussed, using a test
system, local file storage and check sheets before rolling out live. Training on Mobile TERRAIN config/support is being
updated and will be rolled out to COMSAT sites by end of March.

•	10.5 build finalised today - last of the backports from 10.6.

•	10.6 includes App IDs as used by XKEYSCORE. Being upgraded to 64-bit RHEL5. APPId did not make it into 10.6.
Problems with it crashing when ran on Redhat 5. We will be putting this into the first 10.8 build (mid March). [Updated]

•	Flexilogs are showing performance & complexity issues. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^|following up.

•	TDIs also included in 10.6, except they have just changed to a different format, so capability for 10.6 is to be revisited
(old, new, or none)—follow up. TDI’s in Begal in 10.6. We decided to go with the latest Begal engine and
therefore this will work with the latest GTE TDI’s no issue. [Updated]

•	Question raised as to whether GRX tunnels might enhance TDI convergence.	to investigate as a quick win for

Surge Phase 1.

New Apps

•	Orkut, Bebo first drops and MySpace final drops now on Agility trial. A problem with MySpace is being investigated.

•	Orkut, Bebo: Events PC currently cutting code around delivered App, in the absence of any defined requirement. Feature
requirements still need defining. ^^^|to progress.

•	Final drops now on for facebook, eBuddy, MySpace, ICQ, LinkedIn. ^^|lo verfy/validate - starting with LinkedIn

•	Nimbuzz, Whatsapp still awaiting XMPP progress.

Legals still to be chased down.

•	^^|to own OPS Explore phase of MVR rollout.

| to chase task via

| to advise ^^|when apps move across to Explore.

TDIs

• TDIs for HB15:

| has a list of ca. 20. These may need to be prioritised, typically for those which give

Convergence. Currently GTE prioritise TDIs. Theme need to take over prioritisation of Mobile.

king over TDI work from

in April.

[editl 8 Feb 2011 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Mobile TERRAIN

•	Content is only being seen for BlackBerry. Gmail is known to be encrypted, Yahoo has a suspected protocol change

(being investigated), lack of Hotmail content remains unaccounted for.	suggested that the fix would hopefully

require only a patch to TAMING PASTRIES.

•	Tunnel timeout fix is expected to increase convergence rates to ca. 50%. Rolled out to Benhall. ^^|lo pursue rollout at
other sites.

•	Survey enhancement.	to clarify usage.

•	Coco01 (Bude) protective markings incorrectly configured.	| suggested the signal provider should provide the

classification at the same time as providing the signal.	said that the Mobile Access Lead (^^^^^^|) could

take on this responsibility.	to talk to

New Apps

• Facebook: TERRAIN 10.5 should produce about 50% of traffic types.	to clarify whether any of these are
Content.

•	Fring: expected to be ready for Experiment in ca. 1 wk (15 Feb).

•	Feature elaboration should be taken to the same level on both MVR and Mobile TERRAIN. Testing to the full level of
detail, e.g. comparing the two platforms, is a big overhead.

Business benefits

•	reported that Convergence from a Bebo hit had allowed discovery of the PSTN for a Priority 1 target. Further
C2C selectors had followed.

explained the urgent need to demonstrate further value to the business, and requested collection statistics. to
follow up.

•	The focus for the demonstration was discussed. requested TDIs.	explained the recent Project need to focus

on MILKWHITE apps in MVR Experiment.

TDIs

| reported that the low volume of Mobile TDIs seen in Survey was due to GTE rolling them out to only four probes.
Although Project does not have the resources to hand-hold the TDI business, is pushing for wider deployment. This
should resolve our inability to test/approve/deploy them to MVR.

QFDs

•	SOC ANTH: Gb context: awaiting decision from OPS on how to handle bearer type display - may be sufficient to
display the SIGAD.

•	SOC ANTH: GTP CAID issue. Events from Mobile TERRAIN are OK, so it is an MVR issue. Workaround should be in
place to allow re-enabling in SOC ANTH tomorrow (9 Nov).

•	3 x GMM event types being promoted to INTEGER SPIN. This should bring a Convergence benefit.

•	OpEval availability - 2 weeks’ time (22 Feb) suggested but unconfirmed.

[editl 25 Jan 2011 Project Checkpoint

Present: I

The meeting covered a lot of ground. Points are grouped by topic, not in order discussed.
General

•	OpEval is awaiting return of the upgraded Evolved MUTANT BROTH (This will not include the Context store which
provides GTP convergence capability)

•	Important that the Opeval is used to demonstrate business realisation against Mobile Network traffic.

Traffic and survey









Currently approx 12 bearers on cover, two more expected at Bude when coco02 is commissioned.

Early reports from analysts suggest that significant quality traffic is being collected from Leckwith.

Reference data from GMM on MVR is providing millions of hits into INTEGER SPIN (the QFD formerly known as
Evolved GEO FUSION), with thousands of new cells identified. Geo GMM capability destined for Marbled Geko is
being built as a demonstrator within Blackhole. Project to monitor.

OPSD survey work is ongoing, led by	The PPF Survey module is to be installed in MVR Experiment.

Surveys indicate that 10% of traffic is BlackBerry, yet our intercept is 80% BB. The shortfall in expected webmail could
have may causes. Investigations are being led by	May need to call on TPS to conduct tests,

although processing is not a strong suspect.

Convergence

•	Main problem at the moment is poor ratio of convergence, at 5% of tunnel setups being identified. Experiments indicate

that a tunnel timeout fix in TERRAIN will improve this to 50%. Scheduled for TERRAIN 10.5.	| asked if this can

be pulled forward in time for OpEval, possibly via an update to TERRAIN 10.5.	| to follow up.

•	Further improvement would need a more complex tipping architecture.	to follow up.

•	QFD convergence upgrade - HA, eMB + Context store, has slipped to March. Plan is being agreed with NGE SU.

MVR processing

• GTP in-tunnel processing on MVR due in Experiment shortly.	to provide update. Op rollout tentatively suggested

for HB18, i.e. Autumn 2011.This would represent a substantial delay over previous estimates and would have
consequences for supporting SA Terrain.	to follow up.

New Apps

Theme reported that Events they had seen in databases did not fully match the Events they had expected. Theme and TPS
are working together to ensure alignment.

Currently we cannot identify Mobile source for webmail (except Yahoo). Actor-Action ICD Version 2 will improve our
ability to recognise traffic originating from a mobile device.

Legal assurance for new Event types - now believed to be good.	is setting up a meeting between Events PC

and OPP-LEG to confirm legalities.

MES apps on target for Experiment - risks with mail.ru, XMPP (Nimbuzz & Whatsapp): these are not expected to differ





from the non-mobile versions, but confirmation is coming too late to fix them if anything does show up. |______is

following up with the Suppliers.

Mail.ru delayed by lack of a linguist. Now sorted.

Nimbuzz delayed by service account setup complications.

Orkut, Bebo feature lists being developed by GTE Tracking team. Due to overlapping timeframes, there is no guarantee
of delivered feature alignment.	to update feature list.

TDIs

13 now operational, 8 due in HB13, 8 more failed HB13 testing - to be investigated.

•	explained concerns that suitable bearers for TDI validation are not being chosen, leading to high rejection rate
(not just a Mobile problem). is pursuing.

| stressed the importance of TDIs in informing new app selection.

•	reported that TDI rollout has been much streamlined.	felt that the benefits will not be felt immediately,

until GTE can develop fast enough.

•	New TDIs are expected to exploit the leaky app/gateway capability currently being built into the QFDs.

•	TDI capability in Mobile TERRAIN is due in TERRAIN 10.6.

•	Need to evaluate Terrain Ident Capability - separate to TDIs.

FY2011-12 reorganisation

•	The business is recognising the scale and complexity of Mobile app development.	stressed the need to

demonstrate associated benefits, and the need for it to become BAU: this will support an increase in business priority for
Mobile. The wiki is an important tool in communicating process and progress. to follow up.

•	The business is looking at overlaps between Mobile and MTI work. A key difference has been Mobile’s need for more
rigorous testing. The relative states of Mobile vs. MTI test regimes were discussed. Agreement between Mobile and MTI
is needed.

•	The Mobile Surge arises from a FTCG finding that the business needs to do more Mobile. It will choose a specific piece
of work across the business and focus on delivering a specific outcome, without putting additional pressure on known
bottleneck areas. The aim is to prove the business benefits of Mobile.

[editl 11 Jan 2011 Project Checkpoint

Present:

MVR

•	HB13 MVR testing currently unable to verify some mobile TDIs due to lack of traffic. Need to ensure that suitable

Mobile bearers are tasked for these tests.	is progressing.

•	Value of getting TRAFFICMASTER into MVR Agility experiment was stressed.	gain agreement

from TPS and raise RFCs as necessary.

•	Fring is last remaining app from July10 tranche still to go on Agility trial. It requires promotion to TERRAIN:

discussing with TPS later today.

•	Operational-standard GTP module is needed for the Survey MVR system.	has raised this with

QFDs

•	HARD ASSOC and Evolved MUTANT BROTH both now risk slipping to February.

[editl 30 Nov 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Agility and development

•	All required handsets are now available.

•	EAP (MIRTF) back on course: both PPF Apps and TERRAIN prefer this over Lawful Intercept as the strategic solution
to app characterisation.

•	Approach continues to be OPS led for requirements and technically informed. New apps ( bebo & Orkut) to satisfy MES
deadlines not ideal pragmatic in circumstance.

•	GTE will be doing more up front analysis in the future to support feature requirements.

Testing, IV&V

•	Tunnel timeouts: experiment running on bostrom - timeout extended to ihr.

•	i webmail hit seen to date. TND unpacking still being checked.

•	It will be useful to compare MVR output with Mobile TERRAIN, to validate processing once MVR has GTP processing.

•	Agility Trial needs to draw in OPS engagement for evaluating new app exploits. This should help provide leverage for
getting the apps into HBs as well as supporting the Business change aspects.

New Apps delivery













HB 12 is delivering MMS & GMM Content as well as Events

GMMaps: unselected content needs viewing restrictions in place downstream (being done). Two formats for Lat/Long
have been found, which may mean that the HB 12 delivery will be incomplete.	to check whether

individual content types can be turned off.

MMS is now tested and proven.

Nimbuzz and Whatssapp use XMPP protocol, already being delivered under SINO Theme. These apps will be included
in the XMPP delivery. Funding for Oct ’10 tranche will transferred to SINO reducing MES forecast. Orkut and Bebo late
replacements for Shmessenger and to increase funding profile. Suppliers can do the feature analysis. We will still need to
capture details of the Event and Content types to be generated once PRDs have been provided.

TPS will be moving their app feature records from VDD to a new system based on XML schemas. This is not scheduled
but is expected to be in place by the end of 2010.

App delivery timescales between MIP-3 vs. 4 into HBs and Terrain builds are subject to change.

Critical to get July’10 and Oct10 apps onto Agility Trial by end of the FY (March 2011).

MIP-3 & 4

•	MVR GTP expected in experiment space in Jan 11

•	TERRAIN 10.4: no benefit to Mobile for MIP-3. 10.5 will deliver benefits for MIP-4.

•	Content delivery will focus on content we can already visualise.

•	Also need to develop new content types along with refining the approach (e.g. to make better use of Open Source file
viewers).

•	Unselected content issues need better visibility to developers: New Traffic Types needed.

•	Mobile TDIs deployed for MIP-4 unlikely to hit the 100 mark.

•	P6 to be updated for MIPs 3 & 4

[editl 2 Nov 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present: |________________________________________________________________________________|

Focus of the meeting was on the MVR Heartbeat 12 release and New App capability.

Initial apps

•	GMMaps: HB12 expected to process all 12 traffic features ( Terrain 10.3 restricted to 2 features). All will be promoted to
BLACK HOLE and SILVER LINING. Downstream design pending legal decision on what can be passed to which
QFDs.

MMS: HB12 is providing events although suggestion that content promotion should be also be available. Action
to clarify.

•	Hotmail: HB12 will include the protocol update. Such updates do not normally add new features. This one doesn’t.

July 10 apps (MES)

•	None of these will include Windows based Mobile Phones by design, though some may be compatible.

•	Facebook: 1st drop (Login only) received. 2nd drop also, but unconfirmed. 3rd drop expected 3/11. to follow up.
Project will seek to update Agility trial with latest available. From drop 2 on, the implementation rolls desktop and
mobile into a single app, so it is unlikely that we will be able to tell which user client was used.

•	ICQ: PRD-2 outstanding. Action to chase.

•	MySpace: PRD2 just arrived.

•	Fring: due to need for TERRAIN session processing, this is being developed in-house. Awaiting TERRAIN capability -

may be available to install onto Experiment agility. Action	to check.

•	eBuddy. This release to exploit IM only. To be delivered in a single drop, due 3 Dec.

Oct 10 apps (MES)

•	Nimbuzz: PRD-2 due mid-Nov.

•	WhatsApp: PRD-2 due mid-Nov.

•	LinkedIn: PRD-2 due 3rd Dec.

•	Mail.ru: complex delivery which hooks into two other tasks.

•	Shmessenger: Based on WAP/jabber type protocols, so may not be accessible via our current handsets. Detica to
investigate feasibility. If feasible, PRD-2 due mid-Nov. Agreement that we go ahead with analysis with Detica. GTE
findings also to be made available.

TDIs

•	Contractor access to TDI NOCON information resolved: will require signing an NDA - PoC is	Request

has now been raised.

•	40 to go in HB12. to follow up No. of Mobile TDIs in this drop.

Characterisation environments:

•	Pivotal role of TPS in comms between OPS and Suppliers was stressed to support traffic sample collection using
unattributable phones. Comms are now improving.

to check whether suppliers have full set of Lawful Intercept devices each, including Windows.

•	is reluctant to use the Mobile IRTF (EAP) for July Apps & Oct Apps, because it represents a new way of working.

Agreement that Legal Intercept will be used to collect samples. |

is PoG.

Other

•	Tunnel timeout during processing:	is pursuing.

•	Ability to distinguish between mobile and desktop versions will be implemented in AA format version 2, expected
Feb-Mar 2011. To take advantage of this, any given App will need to be updated.

•	Mobile GTP Experiment Agility Trial will be used for quick evaluation of new software drops. It will not be used for
formal testing.

•	Jan 11 apps: list to await outcome of December budget/portfolio review.

[editl 18 Oct 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Agile development

• The Mobile IRTF (EAP) SyOPs is nearing a state at which it can be circulated to GREENHEART for comment/approval.
The need to fit with GREENHEART’s normal business activity was stressed, and any use within sensitive sites ruled out.

Bearer tasking

• At this moment EREPO is the only GRX feed still tasked.
tasking.

is seeking to speed up the process for new/replacement

Infrastructure

•	MAGLITE is delivering IOC capability for: EREPO, Bude (Gn and Gp) processing. Mobile Apps Project approach is
then to improve exploitation of apps and associated convergence.

New Apps

•	Google Maps legals to be cross-referenced with events being generated. This will be used to inform downstream, to
ensure legal compliance.

Facebook initial drop is in TERRAIN 10.3 and contains limited capability but should include convergence data.

•	^^^|has provided a detailed breakdown of New App expected features and event/content types. TPS have received
asks from other areas, stretching resources - e.g. IM and VoIP are done in-house and resources are barely sufficient to
deliver IM asks alone. Prioritisation will be necessary. To help prioritise, Theme needs visibility of projected costs per
feature.^^^l to keep Project informed of actual event/content types to be delivered by each TERRAIN rollout.

Processing

•	TERRAIN 10.3.7 soak tested on bostrom. Lone dhelix error identified as caused by unexpected data type: no further

instances seen. This version will roll into MVR heartbeat 11.

•	TERRAIN 10.3.8 includes new Hotmail protocol. Will shortly start soak testing at Bude. This version will roll out to

PRESTON, Mobile, SMO. PoC for SMO schedule is	To gain visibility of Mobile benefit, Project will work

with	to engage MELs.

•	TERRAIN 10.4 is mopping up changes that were missed for 10.3.

•	6x Mobile TDIs expected in HB11

•	BEGAL processes TDIs within the PPF. Work under way to create an OS-independent version compatible with
standalone TERRAIN. For commercial reasons, TDIs are classified TSS2 NOCON - this makes life complicated.
TERRAIN 10.6 will provide TDI capability.

[edit] 5 Oct 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Survey

•	TDI progress needs clarifying.

Bearer tasking

•	271 has been providing traffic.

•	SSOS have now tasked 040, 521, 099 and 072 to defined hosts -
processing.

•	032 via POKERFACE no longer required.

•	BUDE-TAS still need more training on TERRAIN tasking/monitoring
training team. B to obtain list of trainees and forward to

Processing

•	We have no evidence that webmail is either working properly or not working: issues discussed included likely proportion
of webmail in GRX traffic, lack of characterised light, lack of sufficient markers on records to identify collection source,
immaturity of current data analysis tools. Neither PRESTON nor the EAP can deliver GTP stream format to allow
processing to be confirmed.

•	Significant RISK: IPP have no IA or proposals available for the July ’10 apps, due to delay with Roke.

•	Roke report availability problems with our handsets service to generate characterised data. We do not want this excuse to
be available to them. to pursue.

Repositories

•	SOC ANTH improved version now in beta.

•	Analysis would like clarification of Convergence QFDs. to provide on wiki, on or linked from MIKC wiki pages.

[edit] 21 Sept 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Survey

Survey tool to identify GTP/GRX in 10G’s: RFC raised on Events PC, initial capability due for MIP-2.

•	to find out how many TDIs in the upcoming release are Mobile. [UPDATE: only one.]

| imminently to configure DAG/TERRAIN

and others in OPS.

New Apps

•	should be able to carry out end-to-end tests on webmails using PRESTON handsets, over the next few days. |

to clarify current TERRAIN build for PRESTON. [UPDATE: An RFC would need raising to update the PRESTON
Terrain build - 2 week delay. is investigating with	whether the PRESTON data can be routed to

BOSTROM.]

•	MILKWHITE funding on July’10 and Oct’10 tranches is on target for financial accrual this FY, with apps in
Experiment/Explore stage by then. First Facebook increment already received, with content appearing in TERRAIN

10.3.

•	Facebook Windows O/S handset was not available to be included as part of Roke proposal. Issue is being addressed -

PoC	is responsible for unattributable phones.

Tasking & processing

•	TERRAIN Support arrangements need strengthening. Current reliance on	(SSOS/SSE) for

access to bearers. Business case for access to bearers via MIDDLESEX GREEN with PTC support.

(Mobile Access Lead) to coordinate access. TAS-Bude currently task bearers. TFE and TAS-Bude - tickets not being
raised. TFE relationship to be clarified/strengthened.

•	ACTION:	to seek formal approval for sustained tasking of 040, 271 and 521 via MIDDLESEX GREEN.

•	Ownership of tasking incidents (e.g. loss of light) to be transferred to TAS-Bude. They have requested training in

TERRAIN configuration. No training exists.^^^|has some practical experience:	investigate building

training info on the wiki. Possible option is to revise tasking/support model.

•	Urgent needs to: turn off BlackBerry processing and stop boxes crashing, move 040 to a functional TERRAIN. ^^|is
trying to find out how we can task Support to action.

EREPO: Details of the MAGLITE sustainability uplift to be clarified with	to check with and

whether dual-routing to Mobile Ref is acceptable.

•	Agility trial can only be tasked with 4 bearers while in Experiment. Currently Convergence agility trial is tasked with
040 and 271. When it moves to Explore, more can be tasked - 12 to 20 bearers.

Processing architecture

•	MVR will not provide full Mobile functionality for some time, i.e. GTP content no forecast date. Meanwhile (ca. 1yr)
standalone TERRAIN will be used.

•	explained the differences in webmail processing by MVR (Generic Webmail Framework) and TERRAIN
(TAMING PASTRIES). In due course these should merge into a common code base.

Repositories

•	GMmaps processing is ready although full solution for downstream repository not expected.

•	Not clear whether SOC ANTH can ingest all Facebook Events that will be generated. To be clarified.

•	SOC ANTH - second instance due at Bude in 4-6wks. Queries will be federated across both SOC ANTH instances.

[edit] 7 Sept 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Project

| presented his Action Plan to stabilise the deliverables for MIP-1, following the disappointing outcomes so far.
These actions are necessary before we can move forward - a key objective is to demonstrate value to OPS and gain
confidence in the approach. Two stability issues are critical to success: bearer tasking, and New App processing in
TERRAIN. Other stability issues relate to DAG cards and EREPO.

Access and survey

• Despite some 900 10G bearers being accessible to GCHQ, their GTP potential is not clear. Only a handful of bearers are
known to contain GTP, and tasking of these is unreliable. Project to engage with	to ensure

adequate stability of feeds to enable Project to deliver benefits.

Processing

| is going to become tech director for TPS. As a consequence of this and other upcoming staff moves, TPS
resourcing is likely to be an issue over the coming months.

•	MVR Heartbeat 10 is coming under threat due to issues with new ENCHANTERSS functionality unrelated to Project
needs.

•	Project has closer control of the TPS TERRAIN processing stack, and so will focus on this as the only viable platform
for current deliverables.

•	stated that TERRAIN is a better option for processing tunnelled traffic than PPF.

Testing

•	TPS TERRAIN is now feeding SOCIAL ANTHROPOID. II to continue IV&V investigations.

•	Little Mobile App intercept has yet been seen.^^^| to arrange for live input stream capture & packet analysis, to
confirm presence of Mobile App traffic.

•	(update to Action 14/2):	to arrange cross-BU meeting (Apps/protocol analysis, Testing, CNE) to establish usage

requirements for the EAP/LI and handsets.

[edit] 24 August 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present: I

Survey

•	PPF GTP Survey - all but one field (DNS) already implemented, just not in expected format. Importance of this field to
be evaluated. Aim to have pilot to be available by October (MIP-2)

•	Approx. 30 TDIs are in the system to be developed by GTE. Not clear when this will be rolled out to MVR & TERRAIN
but may be available on Agility trial earlier.

Tasking

[edit] 10 August 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Project

•	MIP-2 to focus on MVR processing, with New Mobile Apps capability being deployed against the core internet.

•	Ownership of Business Change planning to be clarified.

•	Identified uses of the EAP and related facilities include: TDI discovery, GTE quick look at new apps, IPP deeper look
and new apps, IV&V. Documented CONOP is required to clarify usage. This work is being actioned.

Tasking

•	Limited number of GRX bearers and lack of stability make it hard to demonstrate potential and hence obtain buy-in from
the wider organisation. Survey work to date has been tactical and patchy. Quality of the toolset needs to be clarified.

Need to engage	for access and survey support.

New Apps

•	24 TDIs have been requested. Will take up to 6 wks to implement, though will be trialled in Agility before then. GTE can
then survey, to inform next tranche of new apps.

•	If needed sooner to maintain spend profile, will default to more webmail apps.

•	Other possibilities include LinkedIn, iTunes, YouTube, although the ability of Content PC to ingest new formats will be
limited.

•	TPS-IPP, GTE, OPS roles becoming clearer, but still need Project to help define specific activities and ownerships.
Action Mobile Theme to help facilitate clarification of roles.

Processing

•	BlackBerry, MMS operational. TERRAIN 10.2 expected to deliver Gmail & Hotmail fixes, BlackBerry decompression,
Yahoo mail.

•	Bostrom test box has TERRAIN 10.2.5, awaiting	to configure system.

•	Gmail has all gone encrypted, so processing may not be possible .

•	Hotmail service is undergoing transition to new design - may affect our ability to process.

•	Emerging trend towards mobile devices, e.g. HTC Desire, spoofing fixed formats when connecting to app services. May
need to review processing roadmap.

Targeting

•	First 10 TDIs due in TERRAIN 10.3.

•	Mobile selector management for MVR is not so much a problem with TRAFFIC MASTER, as with the ability of
BROADOAK, MONKEY PUZZLE, TACHO, etc. to ingest Mobile selectors.

Convergence

•	NGE are revisiting their roadmap and delivery schedule again. SOC ANTH likely to slip again, eMB and HA
convergence work likely to slip beyond August.

[edit] 27 July 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Project

•	MIP-1 impacted by further NGE delays. A second exception is being raised with delivery date now 25 Aug for Social
Anthropoid.

Tasking

•	3 new GRX ends, including both ends of 521, have been tasked. Data flow not yet confirmed, some issues with UDAQ.

Processing

•	TERRAIN 10.2.5 now on Test system (bostrom). Hopefully this will give us Gmail and Hotmail

•	E2E testing held up until	can fix one of the DAG cards.

•	MVR Heartbeat 10: although GTP processing is being held back, expectation is that Mobile Apps should still roll out to

Core Internet.

has asked IPP for formal statement of Mobile features to be delivered.

New Apps

•	Tranche 2 - Features all now with Industry. Facebook requirement now being considered by industry.

• Next set needs to kick off.	suggested that more mobile webmail would be valuable and easy, also perhaps
restarting Viscom if it is visible in the new feeds.

Data characterisation

•	We need characterised data to inform New App requirements as well as to inform testing. Project has incomplete

technical knowledge of the facilities available. ACTION:	to pull together details of the technical

capabilities/features of the EAP and other sources of characterised handset data.

[editl 22 June 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Project

•	Directors Workbook Review (DWR) due 1 July.

•	Checkpoint meetings moved to new dates/times, to avoid clash with Maglite checkpoint. Revised, more focused list of
invitees.

•	is receiving stakeholder requests which need to be formally actioned. ACTION: ^^^|to call meeting to link
stakeholder requests with change control.

•	Operationally lots of queries being raised as MELs start to analyse GRX collection.

Enterprise Access Point

•	Due to go online at end of June.

New Apps

•	Google Mobile Maps: ^^^^^|to provide steer on legalities for Events vs. Content and consequent
processing/storage of intercept. This is needed to inform plannning.

•	Analysis work by Ops/GTE/TPS to inform requirements is not formally controlled i.e. no forecast completion dates or

formal dependency. ACTION:	define cutoff date for initial analysis of the 5 second-tranche apps.

Dataflow

•	Events for Hotmail and Gmail on Nokia & iPhone will be forwarded via AA to NGE within HB8. These events will only
be available via legacy events systems until Social Anthropoid is completed.

Converged Events

•	SOCIAL ANTHROPOID has slipped, pushing MIP-1 out of tolerance. Exception action underway with Project Board.
Availability for UAT is now 30 July 2010.

•	NGE plan currently has no milestone for SA UAT availability. Ideally we will link to this dependency milestone within
P6.

[edit] 8 June 2010 Project Checkpoint - Status Summary (Updated 14 June)

Present:

Access

•	Bearers being processed by ueda01:

o 040, 271 - routed via POKER FACE

o 044 - was expected to have disappeared but some intercept still arriving, | to check.
o EREPO GAMMA - problems reported yesterday. [Update]	have been asked to investigate.

•	Bearers available on the OSDS:

o 035 (Saudi STM-16) - both ends.
o Other assorted single ends, to be confirmed.

•	These should make up the 10 required for MIP-1.

•	Survey tool - no formal contract placed: we have CmRs but have not levied them.

Enterprise Access Point

•	Wiring-up due over next week, first drop 18 June.

•	TPS should by then have handsets and be able to run test scripts.

Processing

•	Demo of dual-DAG solution using STM-4 + STM-16 due this Thursday.	sees no problems in migrating solution

to dual STM-64 DAGs.

•	Okada01 and 02 each have a single STM-64 DAG. [Updated] PO raised for Second card for each, plus two more for
haga. Project Risk that the cards may arrive too late.

•	There is a risk that TERRAIN may need changes for dual-DAG operation, and if so these may miss MIP-1.

•	If the DAG solution fails, the fallback is to use POKER FACE.

•	SIGADS and PDDGs now configured correctly, except that the SIGADs require a Z suffix for Mobile.

•	Kato01 now has upgraded OS and OVO. All eight Ninjas should be upgraded over the next week or so. is aiming to
get bearers connected up by then.

Test TERRAINs to miss v10.0 and go straight to an early drop of 10.1.

New Apps

•	Still need to confirm content processing for Gmail and Hotmail.

Dataflow

•	We are now seeing Mobile content in IIB.

•	Routing requests for SAMALANCA, HAUSTORIUM and GDR (IIB) have gone in. Still to request full changes needed
to route first to Dev systems, then migrate to Op. Operational data integrity still needs to verified into SALAMANCA
and HAU STORIUM from the output of Ueda 01.

says that the AA format is so different that data set comparison with legacy is not worth doing. will
work with to clarify way ahead.

•	Currently formatting in CCDF v4.5. PCs will upgrade to 1.1.1 when systems are compatible.

Converged Events

•	Agility Trial is providing AA format to NGE (update - has moved from Dev to Op NGE Buffer)

•	Issues over the ways that ENCHANTRESS vs. TERRAIN handle tunnel data are to be resolved.

•	SOCIAL ANTHROPOID user base of ca. 20 is sufficient to meet MIP-1.

Sustainability

•	SSOS access, Bude tasking, TFE 2/3rd line support, and GTE monitoring of POKER FACE, are providing adequate
sustainability for MIP-1.

•	is coordinating work elsewhere to improve GRX access. Project need visibility of this.

Beyond MIP-1

•	Need to confirm dates for TERRAIN 10.1

•	MAGLITE are pursuing GPRS selection for collection - currently still only 1/3 turned on. Project to monitor this.

•	Test handsets are making progress, the first few should soon be available to TPS/GTE. This will allow detailed specs on
the next tranche of exploits to move forward. The process still needs to be formalised to be Ops-driven while technically
informed. Meanwhile, is working on research for Facebook and Twitter features.

•	Bude infrastructure to be delivered for MIP-2.

[edit] 25 May Project Checkpoint

Present:

Project

•	New Level 1 Milestone to be created, for agreement on Twitter and Facebook features to go in TERRAIN.

•	POKER FACE now stable, with over a thousand Content hits in IIB. We are engaging the Analyst community to gain
awareness and evaluate.

TERRAIN







Dual DAG card - demo scheduled for 10 June.

Version 10.1 is available a month early. An interim 10.2 has been mooted, so the currently planned 10.2 may be
redesignated as 10.3.

will work to link feature deliveries to requirements, and to clarify a pre-release build approach for

the Test environment.

Events

absence is holding up the Events L2 design.

• Converged Events in SOCIAL ANTHROPOID - timetable remains unclear.	will continute to push for a date.

•	ACTION:	to check for Mobile Events in HAUSTORIUM & IIB.

[edit] 11 May 2010 Project Checkpoint

Present:

Access

•	Three STM-64 single ends have been identified in the PEBBLE BED GPRS query.	to look for the

other ends.

•	GPRS selector management - the long-term solution for MONKEY PUZZLE and BROADOAK is being pursued by |

Meanwhile,	working to get analysts to select it manually.

Processing

•	TERRAIN’s May 15th level 1 Milestone for operational capability is at risk from issues over RHEL OS vs. OVO (system
monitoring) version compatibility. Versions compatible with each other and with the TERRAIN apps are being sought.
DAG card purchases for the TERRAINs are not visible.^^( to follow up.

•	confirmed that TERRAIN 10.0 will provide BlackBerry, MMS, Gmail and MS Hotmail Content and Events.
Gmail/Hotmail Events will be Send and Read only.

•	BlackBerry decompression will arrive in TERRAIN 10.2. There are advantages to early testing of a pre-release version in
the Mobile Apps Ref environment.

Miscellaneous









The issue of identifying mobile vs. Internet derived intercept was discussed. Any GRX metadata is discarded, so there is
only the app session to go on. Hotmail processing can detect the mobile variant, but the Gmail processor cannot - we
would need to look in the WAP, HTML, etc. metadata. Otherwise, in general we would expect the arrival of mobile
capability to result in a step change in quantity.

The next tranche of mobile apps has several candidate lists put forward by various sources.	is clear that the

choice must be OPS’ call, Project cannot second-guess.

Lots of unprocessed binaries arrive in IIB. We need to push the re-entrant processing (agile development) environment,
in order to explore it. This should help inform future new app decisions.

HB 8 will deliver benefit for Mobile Apps - several webmail events and Gmail & Hotmail content from within the core
internet (outside the GTP tunnel). Detail to be added to project plan.

[edit] 30 March 2010 Project Checkpoint * •

Present:

MIP1

•	Operational benefit by best and most effective operating model should be used	to pursue.

•	We need a period of solid collection and derived value before OPS will buy-in. This is what MIP1 must provide.

•	SSOS have refused to provide mission management for the NINJA systems. No resolution in sight. Tasking want us to

use MVR, but this will not be available in time, so have suggested Agile space in the interim. Re-adoption by Theme has
also been mooted. ACTION:	to pursue decision in next couple of days.

still off sick. OPS are beginning to consider the impact.



Other issues

•	We are now finding sufficient bearers and traffic to process.

•	Work on the DAG cards has paused while the developer fixes an issue with TERRAIN.

Analysts may not always (ever?) be setting the selectors GPRS tick box. This may be why so few results are appearing.

1 is trying to get it set by default. ACTION:	to keep on the case and report back.

release.

•	TERRAIN version numbering has been revised. Action:	to confirm with	the new version

numbering for the TERRAIN 9 April and subsequent releases.

•	Is a map tile Content or an Event? We don’t need to collect the Google tiles as we already have them, just the reference

IDs. Action:	to pursue decision on map tiles.

•	The Agility Trial is not well defined. It would be useful for live testing, but is not essential. In particular, there is an
opportunity to pass Content to the Content Reference system. Action: IV& V team to maintain Agility Trial booking for
Content system. Action: All Core team to engage with TDB Content over the Agility Trial.

Content may still be presented. Content obviously a key stakeholder for this issue.

•	GOLDEN EYE II will take IIB flow from end of March (LOOKING GLASS will have partial capability by then).

App processing:

The Data format issue was previously highlighted via Google Maps. GM also has a content issue.	and

are writing a Problem Statement -	is chasing.

•	PPF, SORCERER and TERRAIN have different requirements managers. The lead Product Centre must be the single PoC
for the Project, and bring people together as needed.

•	Dependencies lead each app through a cascade of product centres. Action	to synchronise PC roadmaps.

•	Viscom spec is awaiting completion of current traffic analysis.
