DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) OPSEC in SID - Some Answers<br>FROM:<br>SID OPSEC Manager<br>Run Date: 01/12/2004<br>FROM: <br>SID OPSEC Manager <br>(U//FOUO) By now everyone has heard about the President's visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving.<br>This was a wonderful example of OPSEC in action, allowing the President to spend time with the<br>troops safely. If we stop and take a look at all the work that goes on in SID, it's easy to see that<br>each of us conducts equally sensitive, although less public, activities every day.<br>(U//FOUO) Last month we asked some questions about how OPSEC relates to SID employees<br>(see previous article ). This month we're going to answer those questions, and hopefully spark<br>your interest to learn even more. The questions we asked were:<br>(U) How can you apply OPSEC in your day-to-day activities?<br>(U//FOUO) Given the wide variety of duties within SID, it would be impossible to give a detailed<br>response applicable to every individual job. However, remember that OPSEC is a five-step<br>process which can be applied to any position or job function:<br>Step 1 - Identify your critical information. What is it that you do every day that an adversary<br>would like to know? I challenge anyone to identify a position in SID that does not have at least<br>one sensitive piece of information.<br>Step 2 - Analyze the threat. Who cares about your information? Does that person or<br>organization have the capability to obtain your information if it is not properly safeguarded?<br>Step 3 - Identify vulnerabilities. Is there anything you do in your daily routine (inside or<br>outside work) that could provide information to your adversary?<br>Step 4 - Assess risk. If you have identified your critical information and determined that you<br>have vulnerabilities in your routine, you're halfway there. Then consider your threat information.<br>Does your adversary have the intent and capability to exploit your information? Do they intend<br>to do harm to you or to your mission? Is there an impact to your mission if your adversary<br>obtains your info? If you have a vulnerability, your adversary has intent and capability, and if<br>there is impact to that vulnerability being exploited, you have risk.<br>Step 5 - Apply countermeasures. Make a change to reduce your vulnerability or to lessen<br>impact. This can be as simple as changing your phone call home to be "I'll be home late" rather<br>than "Things are really crazy here since xxx happened. I'll be home once we finish yyyyy." (Fill<br>in your own scenario for your office.)<br>(U) Where can you go if you have OPSEC questions or concerns?<br>(U//FOUO) There are OPSEC representatives throughout SID who should be able to respond to<br>your questions, or at least point you in the right direction. Additionally, you can always contact<br>the SID OPSEC Program Management team on <br> and we'll be glad to address any<br>questions you may have.<br>(U) Whom can you contact to get more information, more training, or become more<br>involved?<br>(U//FOUO) Additional OPSEC training is available through the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff<br>("go ioss" on the web). Additionally, with help from someone in your office, a SID OPSEC<br>Program Manager can come to your organization and provide a tailored briefing on how OPSEC<br><br> </p>applies to your particular job. One of the ways to get more involved is to volunteer to be an<br>OPSEC representative for your work area. You'll get additional training and monthly updates on<br>what is going on with SID OPSEC, as well as have a forum for discussing OPSEC concerns with<br>other SID personnel.<br>(U) Is there more specific SID-applicable training on OPSEC?<br>(C) Yes! Very soon a brand new online class, OPSE-1201, titled "An Introduction to OPSEC for<br>SID Personnel" will be available via VuPort. This course will step you through a real-world<br>example of a SIGINT operation in a non-conventional location. You'll see an email announcing<br>the course premiere shortly.<br>(U//FOUO) We hope we've answered some of your questions about OPSEC in SID. Look in SID<br>today for future updates on our program and what it means to you. As always, if you have any<br>questions relating to OPSEC issues, please contact your SID OPSEC Program Managers,<br>and <br> on <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
