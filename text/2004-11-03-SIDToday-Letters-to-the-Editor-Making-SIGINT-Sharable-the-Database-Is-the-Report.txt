I am well aware that for years the users of our reports<br>have yelled to know how we know what we know or feel they need the "raw" info to better<br>understand what our reports say, but to indicate that by doing this it allows our customers to<br>analyze and manipulate the data to come to their own conclusions ... that's what we're<br>supposed to be doing! And to say that by allowing access to our databases so "analysts won't<br>have to write reports or respond to RFIs, thereby giving them more time" -- time to do what!, it<br>sure as heck isn't going to be writing reports!!! Since the mid '90s the so called IC has been<br>nibbling around NSA, trying to get more and more of our mission, of our charter into their<br>domains -- with this extremely ill advised decision, not only have they accomplished that, they<br>no longer need to nibble -- now they just get the plate and the fork and get to dine at will.<br>From: <br><br> NORAD/NORTHCOM Collection Mgmt Branch<br><br>Comment: (U//FOUO) Thank you for your recent article on information sharing. Most of the<br>Unified Commands have been advocating this for years and it is gratifying to finally see public<br>support for this concept from within NSA. We understand how tough it will be to change the<br>thinking of many and applaud your work in this area. The folks who made ROADBED externally<br>accessible related their struggle to us, and we understand the resistance to change that must be<br>overcome. In the end, the efforts of people like [the author] will make SIGINT far more efficient<br>and effective. We applaud your work.
