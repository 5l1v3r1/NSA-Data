DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) The Jemaah Islamiyah: A Continuing Threat<br>FROM:<br>Deputy SINIO for East Asia<br>Run Date: 04/28/2004<br>FROM: <br>Deputy SINIO for East Asia <br>(U) Since the existence of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) was revealed in Singapore in December<br>2001, well over 200 members of this terrorist organization have been arrested, detained or<br>killed. However, the capabilities of the JI became apparent in October 2002 when they set off<br>several bombs in Bali, Indonesia killing 202 people, including 88 Australians. In August 2003 the<br>JI struck again, killing 13 people at a hotel in Jakarta. While arrests continue, the JI is still a<br>threat to the stability of Southeast Asia, and there are several reasons for this belief:<br>(U) All senior leaders of the JI central command and control trained in Afghanistan. This<br>group totaled 272 people, and they call themselves G272. While many of these "colonels"<br>have been stopped, there are still many out there free and possibly planning or<br>organizing future attacks.<br>(S//SI) Following the arrest of key members, replacements were easily found. When the<br>chief operations officer Hambali was picked up, several sources indicated that his position<br>was quickly filled. According to SIGINT, the former head of one of the operations areas<br>(called Mantiqis) was also quickly replaced.<br>(U) The JI is also rebuilding itself. Many of the pesentrans (madrassas, or religious<br>schools) in Southeast Asia are currently educating the next wave of JI members. Many of<br>the JI leaders went to the so-called "ivy league" schools, and their children are going<br>there now. Another cell was identified in fall 2003 in Pakistan: the al-Ghuraba cell<br>consisted of about 20 Southeast Asians who were being groomed for the next generation<br>of JI leaders. The members were deported to their home countries and several were<br>arrested or detained.<br>(S//SI) The JI also has relations with terrorist groups in the southern Philippines. The JI<br>has been training in Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) camps since the mid-90s, and<br>SIGINT has revealed that the JI and the Abu Sayyaff Group (ASG) have been working<br>together.<br>(C) There are several targets of opportunity for the JI. There are quite a number of soft targets<br>such as tourist spots, hotels, etc. to attack. In addition, there are several national elections this<br>year in Southeast Asia. The Philippines is holding a presidential election on 10 May -- in late<br>March, several ASG members who were reportedly planning "Madrid-style" bombings were<br>picked up in Manila. Presidential elections will also be held this summer in Indonesia.<br>(U) Another terrorist target might well be very large crude oil carriers (VLCC) transiting the<br>Malacca Straits between Malaysia and Indonesia. Over one-third of the piracy acts reported in<br>2003 took place in the Straits. It is not inconceivable that the JI could link up with the pirates to<br>take control of a VLCC or a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier and crash the vessel into an oil<br>facility. Alternatively, the JI could run the VLCC aground and blow a hole in the ship, creating an<br>environmental disaster greater than the Exxon Valdez. Finally, the JI could also sink a VLCC in<br>the narrowest part of the Straits, blocking traffic until the ship was removed.<br>(S//SI) The Australian Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) is currently aggressively persuing this<br>terrorist group. Any collection information that NSA obtains on the JI is forwarded to the DSD.<br>The CIA has even been passing JI-related information to the Australians in an informationsharing initiative.<br>(U) The JI still remains a threat even though great strides have been made to stop them. Other<br><br> </p>groups that we are not aware of could also be out there. We need -- now more than ever -- to<br>be on the alert for possible attacks that could come from almost any direction causing more<br>damage than we can possibly imagine.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have questions on this topic, contact <br>Liaison Office at <br>s).<br><br> of the Australian<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
