Level 0

Understands basic concept of malware identification and analysis but does not yet
have the breadth of knowledge needed to apply this skill in an operational context.
Has basic understanding of attack vectors and impact of an infection.

Level 1

Has knowledge of open-source and commercial SRE tools and techniques. Can
determine basic functionality of malware using these tools, but requires technical
guidance to go further.

Level 2

Has detailed knowledge of internal and 5-eyes analysis tools, and how they operate.
Works unsupervised to high-level task definitions. Develops discovery and analysis
tools to enhance capability. Can determine main functionality of malware through
static analysis (i.e. SRE).

Level 3

Provides technical direction and guidance to colleagues. Considered a known point
of reference in the field. Contributes to key architectural design decisions when
developing new capability. Displays advanced SRE skills, and uses experience to
provide accurate sophistication & impact assessments.

Level 4

Considered an expert in the field of malware analysis, and a point of reference
throughout the intelligence community and possibly industry. Consistently delivers,
and leads the development of groundbreaking capability. Speaks at conferences and
