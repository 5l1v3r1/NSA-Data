We asked SIGINTers to relate interesting stories of how they<br>came to work at NSA... (U)<br>(U) I was trained as a conservator of library and archives materials. From the time I was a child,<br>I had been a collector of books, not for their content, but for their bindings, and all through my<br>teenage years I purchased books in the antique shops and flea markets of South America,<br>volumes with mother-of-pearl, ivory, elaborately tooled leather covers and elaborate clasps.<br>Thus, when I obtained a specialized masters degree in conservation from <br>,<br>involving organic chemistry, art history and bookbinding, it seemed a perfect fit.<br>(U) Over the next 18 years, I worked as an art, archives and book conservator at <br>. Conservators are responsible for the long<br>term preservation of the cultural and historical record of humankind, which gives a great sense<br>of importance to the field, and as part of this community I derived enormous satisfaction from<br>my work. Conservators often treat objects many hundreds of years old, and expect that the<br>work they do will be seen and handled by scholars 100 years hence or more, and indeed, I<br>treated manuscripts by D.H. Lawrence, repaired bookbindings by William Morris, pieced together<br>fragile civil war maps, <br>(U) After a decade in my profession I had risen to become a Fellow of the American Institute of<br>Conservation, in which I also held elected office, and was regularly consulted by colleagues<br>around the country.<br>(U//FOUO) But something was missing. I felt as though it was time to take on a new challenge.<br>. I applied in 1999 and<br>was told that the Agency did not need my languages, Spanish and French.<br>(U//FOUO) Then came September 11th. We drove home around the empty Beltway with the jets<br>scrambling out of Andrews Air Force Base above our heads, but for my family the worst came<br>late in the day when a call from my daughter's teacher brought the news that her friend <br> and<br>'s family had been killed when their plane crashed into the Pentagon. <br>, 8<br>years old, her sister <br>, 3 years old, and their parents, <br> and <br>, had been deeply loved members of our community. I spent weeks attending<br>memorial services surrounded by stunned fourth graders, and then I resubmitted an application<br>to NSA.<br>(U//FOUO) Time passed, as it will with security clearances, and by the time the offer finally<br>came, my job situation had changed somewhat. I had received two promotions, <br><br> It was a<br>very difficult decision, but in the end, the anticipation of greater personal job satisfaction won<br>out over the seduction of trappings and externals, and I accepted the offer.<br>(S//REL) I have now landed in the Pakistan shop after a year of Urdu language training.

The day will come when the reports we<br>write may be deposited in a SCIF* <br>. When they are<br>declassified many years from now, on that mysterious X1 date, historians will pore over them as<br>they write the histories and biographies of our time.
