1.	Following-up from the previous (14th October) session held on the international,
ECHR and primary EU law aspects of the inquiry, Session I will further examine the
question of the applicable law, including the discussion as to the division of
competences between the national and the EU level as far as 'internal' or 'national'
security are concerned.

On the one side, the Treaty on European Union states that "competences not
conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States" (Article
4(1) TEU) and that "national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member
State" (Article 4(2) TEU). Also, whereas the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union clearly confers certain competences on the EU under Title V of Part
Three on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, certain provisions in this same
Title state that this "shall not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent
upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the
safeguarding of internal security" (Article 72 TFEU) as well as that "[i]t shall be open
to Member States to organise between themselves and under their responsibility
such forms of cooperation and coordination as they deem appropriate between the
competent departments of their administrations responsible for safeguarding
national security." (Article 73 TFEU).

On the other side, the EU has exercised the competences conferred upon it by the EU
Treaties in matters of internal security by deciding on a number of legislative
instruments and international agreements aimed at fighting serious crime and
terrorism, on setting-up an internal security strategy and agencies working in this
field. It needs to be assessed therefore whether or not EU competences in the field of
security have been excluded in so far as they relate to matters of national security. If
this is the case, the question then arises as to the exact extent of this exclusion.
Alternatively, to the extent that EU competences have not been excluded in the field
of security, the question arises as to whether certain provisions of the Treaty refer
instead to the manner in which those competences will be "exercised" by the EU, and
whether there is a distinction to be made between legislative competences and the
execution of operational measures needed to implement EU legislation, as some
academics, including Professor Peers, have suggested. 1
