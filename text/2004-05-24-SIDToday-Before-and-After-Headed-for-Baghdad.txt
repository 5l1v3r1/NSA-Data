Why not interview the future NCR before he deploys, and then<br>again when he comes back? We hope that this "before and after" approach will give a sense of<br>what surprises lay in store for him in Iraq. The future NCR, Mark Cronin, agreed to be<br>interviewed, and what follows is the "before" half of the tale:<br>(C) The NCR Iraq position rotates every 90 to 120 days. On 25 May, Mark Cronin will leave to<br>replace<br> in this position. Mark was asked to volunteer, but he describes this as a<br>legitimate request, i.e., one that he could accept or decline.<br>(C) After discussing the situation with his wife <br>he decided<br>that going to Baghdad was the right thing to do. He'll be there until early September, over the<br>very critical summer months.<br>(S//SI) During Mark's tenure as NCR Iraq, U.S. government representation will transition from<br>the Coalition Provisional Authority to the State Department. The governmental power will<br>transfer to an interim Iraqi government. The primary U.S. official in the country will be<br>Ambassador Negroponte, who until now has served as the U.S. Ambassador to the UN. Mark has<br>already been in contact with the NSA Representative to the U.S.-UN staff,<br>, and so he<br>has an idea of the kind of SIGINT support that the Ambassador will want.<br>(C) What is the role of the NCR Iraq? According to Mark, the job is largely about managing<br>expectations, so that U.S. officials will have a good idea of what NSA can do for them. He will<br>lead the 100+ NSA'ers working in Iraq (their health and safety is of prime concern) and he will<br>support NCR CENTCOM (Greg Smithberger) to keep him fully aware of what's going on incountry. So that he'll be able to "hit the ground running," <br> has been including Mark on<br>relevant e-mail exchanges and has already passed on background information on the important<br>issues. Once in Iraq, Mark will work closely with the Iraq Issue Management Team at Fort<br>Meade.<br>(U//FOUO) For administrative matters, Mark has benefited from a "terrific" deployment<br>checklist, that covers everything from travel medicine (6 shots required) to needed gear (gas<br>masks) to weapons training. The entire deployment process takes more than a month. Living<br>conditions in Baghdad will be demanding (at least compared to those in Maryland - not<br>compared to what others in Iraq are experiencing!). He will share a trailer with three other<br>Americans near the CPA (Coalition Provisional Authority) facilities, and will work from about<br>0630-2200, seven days a week. He will be accompanied by four security guards at all times<br>when traveling, and will ride in an armored SUV.<br>(U//FOUO) Mark believes that keeping up with change will be the major challenge he will face<br>during his TDY-- but that this will be an experience he'll remember for the rest of his life.<br>(U//FOUO) Watch for the "after" article when Mark Cronin returns to the Fort in the fall!<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
