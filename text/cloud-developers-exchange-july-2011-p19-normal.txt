Normalised PageRank

►	Want to find nodes with high Personalised PageRank score, q
compared to its PageRank score, p

►	p and q are both (stationary) probability distributions on the
same set so KL-divergence comes to mind

KL{q||p) = ^ <7; log —

/ Pi

►	We can rank the nodes based on their contribution to this
sum, q, log ^

► This is the Normalised PageRank score
