How about the fact that 46 percent of<br>arms proliferation reporting, 30 percent of counter narcotics reporting, and 29 percent of<br>counterterrorism reporting originate from FORNSAT accesses?<br>(S//SI) Making all of this possible is the cooperation of our Second Party Partners - Great<br>Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. To maintian this level of success the 5-eyes<br>FORNSAT community used to plan ahead and tackle the toughest challenges together at the<br>Joint COMSAT Planning Review Board (JCPRB) and the COMSAT Planning Forum (CPF). These<br>two planning bodies have now been combined into one--the COMSAT Advisory Board (CAB).<br>(S//SI) Focused on long-range planning that will ensure continued successes, the CAB is the<br>first step toward establishing the Global Network Forum (GNF) which is to be inaugurated next<br>month. The CAB will inform the GNF about issues specific to 5-eyes FORNSAT programs, i.e.<br>access planning, architecture &amp; engineering, and SIGINT development.<br>(S//SI) The premier meeting of the CAB, held on 6 and 7 May 2004 at NSA Headquarters, was<br>chaired by<br> Technical Director for FORNSAT. Attendance included delegations<br>from NSA and all 2nd party FORNSAT partners. Following the opening remarks by<br>Chief of Radio Frequency Operations, the participants dove right into challenging issues unique<br>to FORNSAT:<br>a 5-eyes division-of-effort to modernize the FORNSAT architecture,<br>access and collection of mobile satellite services,<br>development of automated survey tools, and<br>advancement of the 5-eyes environmental knowledge base.<br>(S//SI) Each topic was introduced with a short briefing. The participants actively engaged in<br>discussion, sought consensus whenever necessary and made difficult decisions as one body. The<br>format proved to be an excellent model to achieve the CAB goals of:<br>increasing collaboration among FORNSAT partners,<br>making decisions on issues affecting the FORNSAT community within the next 18<br>months, and<br>coalescing FORNSAT's voice as one of the many accesses that make up the global<br>network.<br>(S//SI) We would like to thank participants from the 2nd party organizations, Field Sites, and<br>the following supporters at NSAW: Link Access Programs, Radio Frequency Operations,<br>Cryptologic Exploitation Services, Office of Target Pursuit, and System Integration &amp; Operations.<br>Noteworthy was the participation of the following Delegation Heads: <br>National Security<br>Agency (NSA), Graham Bird, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)<br>,<br>Communications Security Establishment (CSE), <br>Defence Signals Directorate<br>(DSD), and Chris Farrow, Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).<br>(U//FOUO) For specific information regarding the agenda, attendees, and reference material,<br>please visit our web page<br>(U) The next CAB is scheduled for November 2004.
