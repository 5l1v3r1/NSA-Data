(U//FOUO) Governance entails many processes and concepts that
will, in and of themselves, merit definition. Look for these terms in
SID today between now and the end of December. To get the ball
rolling with our "Governance Topic-of-the-Day" series, we'll define
the concept of Governance itself:
(U//FOUO) The goal of Governance, in the SIGINT context, is to
ensure that the various parts of the USSS are working well
together and thus create a synchronized USSS. Governance will set
the stage for a connection that reaches from national leadership all
the way to NSA's newest hires. Within the Governance framework,
statements of high-level intent will be provided to all USSS
elements in order to guide lower-level decision-making as we carry
out SIGINT and CNO.
(U) So, how are we going to do this?
(U//FOUO) To accomplish this, SID Senior Leadership has outlined
four Governance tasks and 17 subordinate responsibilities for the
USSS. A brief description of those tasks follows:
Task #1 - Provide SIGINT to the Nation ;
Task #2 - Direct the USSS in its SIGINT Production ;
Task #3 - Prepare the USSS to provide dominant
SIGINT in the future ;
Task #4 - Support the development of Computer
Network Attack (CNA) capabilities and operations .
(U//FOUO) Governance of the USSS is part of a larger NSA/CSSwide effort, which is spelled out in NSA/CSS Policy 1-3 . This policy

 states that, "NSA/CSS is a global enterprise and shall be managed
as a single organization," the US Cryptologic System (USCS). The
Governance tasks listed above outline the SIGINT portion of this
larger effort.
(U) To find out more, go to the SID homepage . Look under the
"Gearing up for Governance" section; you will find briefing slides
with supporting notes and documentation.
(U) Stay tuned to our "Topic-of-the-Day" series for more terms
associated with Governance.......
