Web Browsing (Exploit with QUANTUM

• The concept	man-on-the-side)

•	QUANTUM is a man-on-the-side capability. If your target has a selector
that is active in the last 14 days, vulnerable to the QUANTUM technique,
and seen by an SSO site that has QUANTUM capabilities, then there might
be the opportunity to detect that communication in real-time and piggy
back with the requested content back into the target's network and
implant the host.

•	QUANTUMTHEORY can be used only if a TAO Project is set up (must
coordinate with your R&T Analyst)

•	QUANTUM NATION can be used regardless of a TAO Project (TOPI does the
tasking in Target Profiler)

•	The biggest difference is QUANTUMTHEORY deploys a stagel implant
called VALIDATOR (soon to be COMMONDEER) and QUANTUM NATION
deploys a stageO implant called SEASONEDMOTH (5MOTH). SMOTHs die
within 30 days of deployment unless requested to extend the life. The
exploit technique is the same.
