Here's a sampling of comments from those who attended:<br>"AWESOME" ..."Great rundown of the SIGINT process" ..."Good background for collection<br>managers" ..."Interesting in that there will be further development of some of the sub-topics,<br>particularly customer feedback"..."Outstanding! This information needs to reach the field" ..."All<br>good briefs, especially target trends - area often overlooked" ..."Very stimulating. Good<br>Questions" ..."Outstanding brief" ..."The Panel Discussions were a good way for NSA to meet the<br>Collection Managers from the S &amp; T Centers and Commands" ... "Worthwhile conference [which]<br>should happen annually".<br>(U//FOUO) Based on feedback from conference attendees, next year's conference will be aimed<br>more specifically at collection managers. The collection managers also requested that more<br>customer-TOPI* interface in small group discussions be incorporated in a future conference.<br>Post-conference action items centered on collection managers' requests for more information<br>sharing from NSA, as well as their recommendations that certain SIGINT procedures be revisited<br>or clarified. Soon, the "lessons learned" and actions resulting from the conference will be posted<br>to NSANet and INTELINK for visibility and tracking.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>TOPI = Target Office of Primary Interest <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
