If that sparked your interest, read on to find out a bit more about<br>the operation...<br>(S//SI) Op CREVICE<br>(TS//SI) Since March 2003, the UK's Security Service and police had been investigating an AQ<br>(al-Qa'ida) support network based in the UK with links to a senior AQ operational planner in<br>Pakistan.<br>(TS//SI) In February, the UK authorities stepped up their efforts in response to key intelligence<br>revealing that a UK-based member of the network was attempting to mount an attack in the UK<br>using a large improvised explosive device. In addition, the Pakistan-based contact was<br>attempting to obtain nuclear material for use in the device, which was apparently to be deployed<br>in the near future.<br>(U) SIGINT Contribution<br>(TS//SI) It was actually an NSA SIGINT report that sparked the heightened level of interest in<br>the Operation, as the report involved a Pakistan-based and UK-based individual discussing,<br>amongst other things, the composition of a probable explosive.<br>(TS//SI) During February and March, GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters)<br>provided reporting which helped assist Pakistani authorities in locating and detaining the<br>Pakistan-based individual. Call records analysis and reporting expanded Security Service's<br>network knowledge and helped to identify new telephone numbers of key targets in the UK. C2C<br>(computer-to-computer) analysis provided new leads on a Canada-based individual within the<br>network, and other reporting helped to validate the activities of one of the key overseas<br>members of the network.<br>(TS//SI) Overall, well over 100 SIGINT reports were issued on Operation CREVICE. Although the<br>majority of End Product was GCHQ originated, the NSA reporting contributed significant pieces<br>to the jigsaw.<br>(TS//SI) Now that arrests have been made, GCHQ is monitoring for any further significant<br>activity, and End Product has been issued on various individuals spreading news of the arrests.<br>In addition, GCHQ is likely to receive more targeting information from Security Service as the<br>investigation continues.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"></p>
