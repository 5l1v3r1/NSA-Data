Query Focused Dataset

What are QFDs

•	A database designed for answering a
single (or few) analytic question

•	Initially adopted from
research, engineering tasked to
mature and scale ASAP

•	The engineering has been
incremental based on priority

•	Library of components and design
patterns developed

•	Scale using appropriately sized
database instances, federation
using service tiers

•	Deployment of new instances and
updates streamlined

•	Corporate support

•	New QFDs still being produced by
engineering and others using the
standard components

•	Some now provided interactive
access to datasets generated by
HADOOPS batch analytics

QFD Facts and Figures

•	Approximately 100 QFD instances
deployed for 16 different QFDs ♦
more for Ul etc

•	Each with events (or results)
appropriate for the questions they
answer

•	Hardware shared depending on
QFD, all storage is shared

•	Driven by the need for a flexible
platform at large scale with low
overall cost

•	Redhat Enterprise Linux, Oracle DB
(DB needs are simple)

•	Latest generation HP BL456c 67
blades, 24 core, 64GB RAM, EVA
storage "200TB usable

•	Most QFD instances have 70TB
usable capacity

•	Total storage 15PB raw, 11PB usable
