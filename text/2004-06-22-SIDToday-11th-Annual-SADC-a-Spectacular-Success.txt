Sponsored by Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (S31),<br>the SADC is a technical conference spanning all disciplines of Signals Analysis (SA). Over 400<br>members of the Intelligence Community (IC) representing more than 30 field sites and 2nd<br>Party Partner sites around the world attended briefings, discussions, training sessions, tool<br>demonstrations and tours of several facilities at the Fort Meade campus.<br>(U//FOUO) The conference began with keynote addresses by:<br>MG Richard J. Quirk, Director of Signals Intelligence,<br>Mr. Fran Landolf, Chief of Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services,<br> Branch Head, Communications Signals Analysis, Research &amp;<br>Development, GCHQ, and<br>LTC Joseph Pacileo, Chief of CES/Signal Survey and Analysis.<br>(U//FOUO) Afterwards,<br> Signals Analysis Skill Community Advocate,<br>presented the 7th Annual Signals Analysis Skill Community Awards. The GOLD PULSE AWARD<br>, presented to <br> , recognizes exceptional technical excellence and<br>contribution to the SA community. <br> is a senior signals analyst at Menwith Hill Station.<br>The Charlie Tevis Community Service Award , presented to <br> , Signals<br>Analysis Skill Community Director, recognizes exceptional service and contributions to the SA<br>Community.<br>(U//FOUO) This year's theme, "Signals Analysis: Following Through to SIGINT Successes" was<br>mirrored by the diverse range of presentations. Subjects of the talks encompassed every aspect<br>of signals analysis, including technical analysis of specific signals, error correction, data network<br>intelligence solutions, software developments and new signal technologies. From bit level<br>analysis to target development, the presentations of this year's conference highlighted the<br>efforts of signals analysts along the path towards successful sustained production of SIGINT.<br>(U//FOUO) Conference attendees had opportunities to attend tours of cutting-edge laboratories<br>and operations centers around the NSA campus. Tours offered included the DNI Lab (S31212),<br>the Forensics Lab (S31151), the Anechoic Chamber (S3163), the Tordella Super Computer<br>Building, the Technical Exploitation Center (S31123), and the National Cryptologic Museum.<br>(U//FOUO) With this year's success, the SADC continues to gain recognition as a vital analysis<br>conference, contributing to all aspects of SIGINT production. In addition to advancing technical<br>awareness, the SADC facilitated teamwork across the extended IC enterprise by developing an<br>awareness of current developments and capabilities of all stakeholders. This familiarity with our<br>own expertise builds and strengthens the social network that is the channel for following<br>through to SIGINT successes.<br>(U//FOUO) The enthusiasm of all the participants and their continuing appreciative feedback has<br>made the 2004 SADC a shining success!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
