Do you wish you could pick the means by which this information was delivered<br>to you? Would you like the convenience of viewing Agency-all e-mails and DIRgrams from either<br>Outlook or via the web without filling up your inbox?<br>(U) All this and much more is possible using RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, one of the<br>fastest growing technologies on the Internet. RSS is an XML standard for content syndication in other words, making your content easily available to other web sites and other applications.<br>(C//SI) In NSOC, we are using RSS technology to populate the content of the NSOC Olympics<br>support page ("go nsoc-olympics"). Using RSS, we are able to display the latest news items<br>from the Global SIGINT Highlights, the Enduring Freedom Summaries, the DIA Early Bird, the<br>Classified World News, and other sources of data on a single web page. As the summer<br>approaches, we will be adding additional RSS feeds to our site, so that the NSOC Olympics page<br>will be a true information portal, as opposed to just a "page of links."<br>(U) However, don't make the mistake that RSS is only for news items. Database queries, audio,<br>video, equipment health and status, and many other sources of data are just some of the types<br>of information sources that can be syndicated via RSS. Basically, if you can define a URL to your<br>data, you can syndicate it via RSS.<br>(U) On the Internet, data sources as varied as Dilbert, ESPN Sports news, bankrate.com<br>mortgage news, and Microsoft security updates are all available via RSS. At last count, there<br>were over one million RSS feeds available on the web, with more being added every hour.<br>(U) RSS has the potential to revolutionize the way we view the web, both at home and here at<br>work.
