TOP SECRET STRAP 1

• Op QUITO (TSI): Following a couple OMGs and a significant amount of prep work,
the planning phase of Op QUITO, an effects op to support FCO's goals relating to
Argentina and the Falkland Islands, is almost complete. The plans are due to go to
submission in the next month, and then this will hopefully lead to a long-running,
large scale, pioneering effects operation.
