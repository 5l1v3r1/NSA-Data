[edit] TPM 1ti?ulnerabiliijes to Power Analysis and an Exposed Exploit to
Eitlocker

Presenter: 

Power analysis. a side channel attack. can be used against secure devices to non?inyasiyely
extract protected information such as implementation details or secret keys. We have
employed a number of publically known attacks against the ELSA found in TPMs from ?ve
different manufacturers. We will discuss the details of these attacks and provide insight into how priyate
TPM key information can be obtained with power analysis. In addition to conventional wired power
analysis. we will present results for extracting the key by measuring electromagnetic signals emanating
from the TPM while it remains on the motherboard. We will also describe and present results for an
entirely new unpublished attack against a Chinese Remainder Theorem implementation of ELSA that
will yield private key information in a single trace.

The ability to obtain a private TPM key not only provides access to data.
but also enables us to circumvent the root?of?trust system by modifying expected digest values in sealed
data. We will describe a case study in which modi?cations to Microsoft's Eitlocker metadata
preyents software?level detection of changes to the BIDS.
