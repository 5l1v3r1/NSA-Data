BULLRUN Col - Briefing Sheet

Introduction

1.

The ability to exploit targets? communications is extremely fragile and is
often enabled through sensitive ECI programmes. The need to take additional
measures to protect that capability has Ion been recognised. Currentiy, virtually
all is carried out by PTD processing with going to
the HS in the |I'Sol; some are placed in the ENDUE |I'Sol due to
the sensitivity or fragility of the exploitation capability.

In recent years there has been an aggressive effort; lead by NSA, to make major
improvements in defeatng network security and privacy involving multiple
sources and methods, all of which are extremely sensitive and fragile. These
include: Computer Network Exploitation collaboration with other
Intelligence Agencies; investment in high?performance computers; and
development of advanced mathematical techniques. Several ECI compartments
may apply to the specific sources, methods, and techniques involved.

lvlaking the best use of these new capabilities requires that processing
be widely deployed beyond PTD and the results of that processing be available to
awide range of This inevitably makes it harder to protect this sensitive
and fragile capability and we need to counterbalance this by introducing
measures to control access to this material and heighten awareness of the
sensitivities amongst those who have access.

To achieve this, NSA has introduced the BULLRUN |I'Sol to protect our abilities to
defeat the used in network communication technologies. This covers
both the "fact of? a capability against a specific technology and resulting 
[which may be either plaintext or metadata {events}. GCHQ is also introducing
EULLRLIN. (CSEC, DSD and GCSE are expected to do likewise.)

Control Authority

5.

The BULLRUN |I'Sol is owned by the Deputy Director for Penetrating Target
Defences Authority to manage the |I'Sol is dele ated to the PTD Lead for
Special |Dperations and Policy (currently and the PTD Security
and Release Authority currentiy_}.

BULLRUN Sensitivity and Coverage

5.




It is imperative to protect the fact that GCHQ, NSA and their Sigint partners have
capabilities against speci?c network security technologies as well as the number
and scope of successes. These capabilities are among the Sigint community?s
most fragile, and the inadvertent disclosure of the simple "fact of? could alert the
adversary and result in immediate loss of the capability. |I'Son seduently, any
admission of "fact of" a capability to defeat used in speci?c network
communication technologies or disclosure of details relating to that capability
must be protected by the BULLRUN and restricted to those specifically

indoctrinated for BULLRLIN. The various types of security covered by BULLRUN
include. but are not limited to. TLSISSL. (eg. webmail}. SSH. 
chat; ?v?PNs and The speci?c instances of these technologies
that can be exploited will be published in a separate Annexe (available to
BULLRUN indoctrinated staff}.

T. In addition to the specific technologies that GCHQ or its Sigint partners are able
to exploit; the methods used to achieve the exploitation must also be protected.
These include support from other organisations. both internal and external to
GCHQ. Access to BULLRUN does MDT imply any "need?to?know" the details of
sources and methods used to achieve exploitation and. in general. there will be
ND "need?to?know". Requests for access to information on sources and methods
should be sent to if considered appropriate. this access may require
clearance for certain ECIs.

S. BULLRUN material. data. and details must be protected with the use of the
BULLRUN |I'Sol and be marked with the label in addition to the
required privacy marking and other descriptors. Use of the BULLRUN marking
is restricted to and its Sigint :2"d Parties.

Access and Security

9. Requests for access to the |I'Sol must be sponsored by a SIDS or above and must
be accompanied by a business case outlining the "need?to?know". Access for
contractors will be limited and will require a strong business case; such requests
should be discussed with the |I'Sol Authority?s delegates before submission.
Requests for access are to be sent by email to PTDAccesses.

1t]. Knowledge of BULLRUN information and access to the BULLRUN |I'Sol will only
be granted to indoctrinated individuals.

11. It is the responsibility of sponsors [or their successors} to notify (via
PTDAccesses} when an individual no longer require access to BULLRUN.

Handling Procedures

12. |Dwners of BULLRUN materials are responsible for correctly marking the
information and for ensuring that it is handled according to guidelines for
protecting classified or information.

13. Reports derived ?om BULLRUN material shall not reveal [or imply} thatthe
