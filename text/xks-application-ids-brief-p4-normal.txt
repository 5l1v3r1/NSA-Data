Levels

Levels are 1.0 - 9.9 with lower numbers having a higher priority. This
allows multiple signatures to match a piece of traffic and only the
most specific appid will be applied. An example might be:

9.9 Yahoo

9.8 Yahoo/chat

9.7 Yahoo/chat/incoming

Since the Yahoo/chat/incoming has the lowest level, the traffic will be
labeled as yahoo/chat/incoming
