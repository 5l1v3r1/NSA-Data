rS//SI//REL) TAO-enabled collection against the Mexican Office of the President (project FLATLIQUID) has also been a lucrative source of SIGINT. In |
late May 2010, TAO successfully exploited a key mail server in the Mexican PRESIDENCIA domain within the Mexican Presidential network to gain
Irst-cver access to President Felipe Calderon's public email account. The targeted domain, also used by the Mexican presidential cabinet, contained
diplomatic, economic and leadership communications which continue to provide insight into Mexico's political system and internal stability. Collection
om FLATLIQUID accesses has provided reportable intelligence for several S2 product lines at both NSA/CSS Texas and Washington as well as SCS
dcxico City.

I(TS//SL7REL) These TAO accesses into several Mexican government agencies arc just the beginning -• we intend to go much farther against this important |
¡target. TAO, S2C (International Security Issues) and FTS2F1 (Southern Arc) are poised for future successes against our neighbor "south of the border."
