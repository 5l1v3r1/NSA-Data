This is the other:<br>(TS//SI) After two exciting and educational years in Moscow we<br>moved on to a much quieter and more civilized assignment in<br>Milan, Italy. The living was good and the work, though rewarding,<br>never presented the challenges we faced in Moscow. Our next<br>assignment, Belgrade, would turn out to be more like Moscow than<br>Milan.<br>(U) Belgrade at this time was an exciting and interesting place.<br>Local politics were in a state of turmoil and the local population<br>became more and more dissatisfied with the national government<br>as time progressed. Anti-government demonstrators were<br>marching through the city every day. As long as the marchers<br>didn't venture into certain areas of the city, there was minimal<br>police interference.<br>(TS//SI) The main mission of the SCS site was to monitor events in<br>Bosnia, particularly the Serbian conclave there. We had excellent<br>access and were producing numerous transcripts locally as well as<br>forwarding a huge volume of intercept to the Balkans Division at<br>NSAW. As the situation worsened in the Kosovo Region of Serbia<br>the site's focus shifted, especially when accusations of atrocities<br>were made against Serbian forces in the region. The site also had<br>good access into this region and continued to provide timesensitive reporting to U.S. officials at the embassy.<br>(TS//SI) The U.S. government entered into negotiations with<br>Slobodan Milosevic to try to find a solution to the Kosovo situation.<br>Richard Holbrooke was the primary U.S. negotiator and was an<br>avid reader of the site's material. Following months of promises<br>made and promises broken, Mr. Holbrooke presented a final<br>proposal to Slobodan Milosevic that, if rejected, would lead to<br>international intervention. Milosevic deferred acceptance of the<br>proposal to the national parliament knowing that they would reject<br>it. By this time, all but essential embassy personnel had been<br>evacuated. There were about ten American officers, including two<br>SCS members, left at the embassy as well as the Marine Security<br>Guard Detachment. The site had been working 18-20 hour days for<br>more than a week at this point.<br>(TS//SI) After presenting the proposal, Mr. Holbrooke returned to<br>the embassy to watch the parliamentary debate on Serbian<br>television. Most of what was left of the Embassy staff watched<br>along with him as the proposal was soundly rejected. Mr. Holbrook<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.

We waited for word from the State Department to<br>begin our final destruction and evacuate the Embassy. It didn't<br>take long for that word to come. Two of us destroyed the site's<br>equipment, about $6 million worth, in a little over six hours. Other<br>embassy officers were doing the same thing in their offices.<br>(U//FOUO) After a long night we met in the embassy garage at 5<br>A.M. A convoy of armored vehicles took us to the airport to board<br>a U.S. Navy C-9 that was waiting to evacuate us to Budapest. The<br>Marines with us were fully armed. Nobody was sure what to expect<br>from the local government, but we made it to the airport with no<br>hindrances and safely left the country. Our drivers, locals known as<br>Foreign Service Nationals (FSN), were not so lucky: when they left<br>the airport they were chased all of the way back to the embassy.<br><br>12.

Many of the embassy FSNs left their country, going first to<br>Hungary and then as refugees to the U.S. Some of them stayed in<br>the U.S., but others returned to Belgrade following the fall of the<br>Milosevic government.<br>(U) My wife and I, after a week in Budapest, evacuated to the U.S.<br>where we spent three months before going on to our next<br>assignment. All of the personal effects that we had with us in<br>Belgrade were lost, though we did get a handful of things back<br>after the embassy reopened two years later.<br>(TS//SI) Most everybody who has spent time with SCS in the field<br>has similar stories.
