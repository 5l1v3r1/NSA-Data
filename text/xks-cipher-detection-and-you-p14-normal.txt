Trade-off

a

•	Fingerprints easily deployed, hut limited to pattern
matching.

•	Plug-ins slow to deploy, but allow for complex testing.

•	New compromise:

•	Snippets of C+ + code in fingerprint

•	Deployed hourly like fingerprint with most ol the flexibility ol a
full plug-in.

•	Very complicated tests probably still need to be plug-ins.

•	Currently stood up at only a few sites.
