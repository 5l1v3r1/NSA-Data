(C//REL) Kaspersky User-Agent Strings

(U) Introduction

(U//FOUO) Kaspersky Lab is a privately held company with headquarters in
Moscow, with regional offices elsewhere. Kaspersky has (at least) three products
Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS), Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV), and Kaspersky Mobile
Security (KMS). The Anti-Virus engine is used by other security vendors. Kaspersky
products are quite popular in some parts of the world.

(U//FOUO) This work was begun with
Princeton..

at SCAMP 2008 at IDA/CCR-

(U) Data

(TS//SI//REL) We used YACHTSHOP metadata records for our study of
Kaspersky User-Agent strings, as well as some information discovered by using Google
searches on the Internet.

(U) User-Agent Strings

(TS//SI//REL) The Kaspersky client sends its own User-Agent strings when
requesting updates. Some examples are

GET /diffs/bases/ids/i386/idsbase.kdz.7f- HTTP/1.0
Host: dnl-r01.kaspersky-labs.com

User-Agent: wnB4BwnB_p_ujCg31COBANOC4wLjAuMzU3

GET /index/u0607g.xml.klz HTTP/1.0

Host: dnl-us5.kaspersky-labs.com

User-Agent: wnBAAAs9sHlBANOC4wLjAuNDUO

The Kaspersky User-Agent strings are of three types

1.	E@

2.	pD-kBpDm5jf46pEQ@

3.	umB09B umBgmgvrB-sXFANNy4wLjAuMTI 1

The User-Agent strings use the characters [A-Za-z0-9-_l, which is the same alphabet as is
used in base64 encoding. Further, the last twelve characters of the third type are, in fact,
base64 encoding of the version number. These version numbers range from 6.0.2.614 to
8.0.0.357 in our data.

(U) Updates

(S//SI//REL) The update requests we observed often occurred on a regular basis,
often every 20, 40, 120 or 140 minutes when the machine is on-line. They began with a
GET request for an index page, i.e. /index/u0607g.xml.dif and/or /index/rt60.xml.klz.

(S//SI//REL) This was immediately followed by a set of requests for update files:
first, a set of files such as

/bases/blst/blst-0607g.xml.dif

/bases/ids/i386/ah-i386-0607g.xml.dif

/bases/av/avc/i386/av-i386-0607g.xml.dif

/bases/av/avc/i386/av-i386-0607g.xml.klz

/bases/pdm/pdm-0607g.xml.dif

/bases/info/info-0607g.xml.dif

/bases/rt/rt-0607g.xml.dif

/bases/upd/upd-0607g.xml.dif

(blst = black list, ids = intrusion detection system, av = antivirus, upd = update),
then, a set of files such as
/AutoPatches/kav6/kav6-0607g.xml.dif
and a set of files such as

/diffs/bases/blst/black.lst.nsr
/diffs/bases/av/avc/i386/ext001.avc.wvg
/diffs/AutoPatches/kav6/7.0.1.321/avpgui.ppl.ryh.

We did not see any use of query strings or cookies in the update requests.

(S//SI//REL) User-Agent Fields and Encoding

(S//SI//REL) Now we turn our attention to the User-Agent strings themselves. Let
us take a typical example, as above:

umB09BumBgmgvrB-sXFANNy4wLjAuMTIl

(S//SI//REL) The last 12 characters are the base64 encoded string
Ny4wLjAuMTIl, which, in this case, decodes to 7.0.0.125 (the version number) and
leaves us with

umB09BumBgmgvrB-sXFAN

S3T/TECH/XX/2008

(S//SI//REL) At first, it appears that there are fields separated by "B" characters,
but upon looking more closely, it can be seen that there are two sets of characters, [A-Za-
f] and [g-zO-9-_], i.e. two sets of 32 characters each. It appears that each field is a set of
characters from the second set followed by a character from the first set. We believe that
the characters are composed of a leading flag bit followed by five intelligence bits, where
the flag bit indicates the end of a field. Thus we parse the above string into fields:

umB 09B umB gmgvbB -sX FAN

(S//SI//REL) Field one and field three are normally the same and the first three
fields are usually two or three long. Field six is always one or two long, about half of the
time two long. If it is two long, the second character is a "B". Since "B" is the second
character of the first alphabet set, its natural value is 1. That is, if we reverse the order of
the characters in this field, the entire field takes on values 0-63. Taking this as our cue,
we concluded that the order of the characters in each field should be reversed, and each
field represents a number encoded base32, with end-of-field flags.

(S//SI//REL) With this interpretation, field five appears to be flat over the range 0-
218, the largest value seen being H_g7 = 261147, while 21 =262144.

(S//SI/REL) The first five fields appear to match with specific clients. The main
exception is Dp Bk- Dp fj5m Ko (another parsed Kaspersky User-Agent) which is seen
with a large number of clients. As we shall see, fields two, three, and four are the serial
number, and this particular serial number is one of those being passed around on the
Internet.

(S//SI//REL) Studying the flow of GET requests, we observe that in many cases,
there is an update request at regular intervals. Probably such a request is made in all cases
in which the machine is on-line. These requests begin with a request for one or two index
pages, followed by further requests for update files, all with the same User-Agent. Later,
on the regular beat, the next request will have the same User-Agent string, except that
field six will have changed:

Thu Jul 3 21:13:56 2008 Dp Esi II QjlOm Eq-0 MAN 6.0.2.618
Thu Jul 3 23:33:56 2008 Dp Esi II QjlOm Eq-0 Bz A N 6.0.2.618

(S//SI//REL) The beat at which the requests are made appears to be correlated
with the type and version number. The type 2 requests often come every 20 minutes, and
about 20% of the time ticks up with an increment alternating between 30 and 34, mod 63.

(S//SI//REL) The type 3 requests often come at beats of 120 or 140 minutes,
ticking up by 24 in the 120 case, and 39 in the 140 case, both mod 64.

S3T/TECH/XX/2008

(S//SI//REL) Field seven, if present in type 2 strings, is an "E", or in type 3 strings
there is a field seven, "A", and possibly a field eight, "N". In our data, in the type 2
strings, unless there is a field seven with an "E", the requests only ask for klz files, such
as /index/6/a0607g.xml.klz. Also in our data, the type 3 strings with no eighth field, i.e.
no "N" value, were all from version 6.0.2.614, while none of the version 6.0.2.614
strings had a seventh field. We believe these indicate services and/configurations.

(U) Types of User-Agent Strings

(S//SI//REL) There isn't much to say about the first type of User-Agent string,
ME@M. It presumably represents some limited capability trial version.

(S//SI//REL) The second type is more interesting as it parses as described above.
The parsed version usually begins Dp Bk- Dp fj5m, followed by a field five mostly of
length three or four, a sixth field which ticks up as discussed before, and possibly a
seventh field consisting of an "E@".

(S//SI//REL) The one exception is the Dp Bk- Dp fj5m Ko mentioned above, in
which field five is two long. Further, this one does not tick up, but always appears the
same.

(S//SI//REL) We have more information about the third type, in which the last 12
characters are the encoded version numbers. We observed:

Version	First Field
6.0.2.614	Dp, Bkt, or Bkx
6.0.2.618	Dp, or Dr
6.0.2.621	Dp, Bkx, orBm7
6.0.3.837	Dt, or Dz
7.0.0.119	Bmt
7.0.0.124	Bmt
7.0.0.125	Bkt, or Bmt
7.0.1.321	Bmt, or Bmu
7.0.1.323	Bmu
7.0.1.325	Bmt, or Bmu, or Bnr
8.0.0.357	Bnw, or Bnx

(S//SI//REL) So it seems that the first field is tracking along with the version
numbers, so it could relate to the date at which the product is activated, but is not directly
equivalent to the version number.

(S//SI//REL) Type 3 strings are all seven or eight fields long.

(S//SI//REL) Kaspersky Serial Numbers

(S//SI//REL) Kaspersky products come with key files with names such as KI-
KSS/00102CCB.key which contain a serial number and a license number, in this case the
keys with serial number 03c2-000486-00102cc. Here are a set of such pairs (or one-half
of such pairs) of serial numbers and license numbers, which we found posted on the
Internet.

(S//SI//REL) Notice that the first segment of the serial number and the license
number is the same. Also it appears that the serial number is entirely in hex, while only
the first segment of the license number appears to be in hex. With one exception, the
second segment of the license number appears to be related to the version number; all the
cases we observed in our data begin with a 6, 7, or 8.

S3T/TECH/XX/2008

(S//SI//REL) One of the frequently occurring User-Agent strings, when parsed,
becomes (Dp Bk- Dp fj5m H47w). By converting these strings into hexadecimal
numbers, this becomes

00000069 0000049e 00000069 000f8f26 0003e370.

(S//SI//REL) Now examine the lines above. We find serial number 049e-000069-
000f8f26.

(S//SI//REL) We also have (Bnx Cps Bmu B7481- Ehl v), which equates to
000004fl 0000092c 000004ce 03bc70be 000206af 00000032, which matches 092C-
0004CE-03BC70BE, above.

(S//SI//REL) There are also close matches:

000004ce 000007b4 000004ce 02b780c0 00005d9e

with

07B4-0004CE-02B780BA,

and

000004cd 00000494 000004cd 02439bf2 0001362b

with

0494-0004CD-02439E4C.

(U) Key Files

(S//SI//REL) We located three key files and examined them. The first four bytes
of the key files contain the signature KLsw. After an initial header, the key files can be
parsed into records with an algorithm something like type-length-value. In general, the
fields of the records are as follows (in hex):

Position	Content
1	01
2	00
3	00
4	09
5	01,03, or 05
6	Specific kind of information in the value field
7	00

8	00 or 08
9	Format (01= blank, 09=4-byte word, 0b=8-byte word, 28=string beginning with 2-byte little endian length, 49=16 byte word,
10+	Value

(S//SI//REL) For example:

01 00 00 09 05 01 00 01 28 16 00 4b 61 73 70 65 72 73 6b 79 20 6c 61 62 20 6b 65 79 20
66 69 6c 65

(S//SI//REL) This is a record in which the data is in string format of length
0x0016 =22, with the string being "Kaspersky lab key file". Byte 5 was also 01 in the
(two) other key files we looked at.

(S//SI//REL) The version number was given in the record in which byte 5 = 0x05.
The GUID is given in the record in which byte 5 = 0x17. The customer name and license
number is given in the records in which byte 5 =0x08. However, other lines with byte 5 =
0x08 contain an email address. The serial number is given in a header, which doesn't play
by any of these rules.

(S//SI//REL) The key files contain the user's name, location, ISP, a GUID, and
what appears to be a base64 encoded key string. It might be possible to get more
information out of these files with sufficient examples.

(S//SI//REL) We discovered what appear to be some activation keys being passed
around on the Internet, either because these keys represent the free trial keys or because
the software has been hacked:

HTWUA-543AX- SZ9DB - Y QZSQ

T1JVS-NNMBD-K1QTN-SUBP8

T6B6K-8YK22-VBQH7-ZUZJG

M38RS-DZJS7-X4ZT7-UACTR

2P67K-E9TG7-EF7QQ-YM2XZ

(U) Update Files

(S//SI//REL) Update requests retrieve various types of files which are identified
by short printable strings at the beginning of the file. In a small survey, we observed
APDB, AVZ, DIFF, DIFT, EK.8, KDC1, KL, KLBL, KLD2, KLZF, PK, SFDB, PK,
SFDB, and SQZE.

S3T/TECH/XX/2008

(S//SI//REL) Among other things, these files contain base64 encoded strings, such
as

B+ANCjs6MTAONmRONW5CandscXVWbl MwOERWL()9yaEl 5dlN4ampKSERsV lk
rdnJ50UNPVkl5Rl lEWHYxTy8yMHdvOHIV 1 lLUm82b3 VrSWthcWJlbzFwaGdjbnZ

which decodes to:

0wo8YHWYKRo6oukIkaqbeol phgcnvOn

and/or

0XLSznpdI71 fB300e7Uwj 1 FQiJdREynaxjSBw Y/592TW8JvlVEx 1 VX8CgX
which does not decode to anything immediately interesting
(U) Conclusion

(S//SI//REL) It appears that the Kaspersky User-Agent string used to request
updates is in general unique to the client, carries a coding for the serial number, and can
be used for machine identification. We also believe the User-Agent string carries
information about services contracted for or configurations. Study of a few matched
versions numbers, User-Agent strings, serial numbers, license numbers, activation keys,
and key files should settle this.
