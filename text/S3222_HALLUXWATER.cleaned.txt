(TS//SI//REL) HALLUXWATER Persistence Implant Concept of Operations

I

(TS//SI//REL) Once installed, HALLUXWATER communicates with an NSA operator
via the TURBOPANDA Insertion Tool (PIT), giving the operator covert access to
read and write memory, execute an address, or execute a packet.

(TS//SI//REL) HALLUXWATER provides a persistence capability on the Eudemon
200, 500, and 1000 series firewalls. The HALLUXWATER back door survives OS
upgrades and automatic bootROM upgrades.

Status: (U//FOUO) On the shelf, and has been deployed.
