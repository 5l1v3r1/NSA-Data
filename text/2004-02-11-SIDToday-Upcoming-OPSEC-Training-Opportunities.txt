By now everyone has heard of OPSEC in<br>some shape or form and has even mastered the OPSEC 1301 course. We want to thank<br>everyone involved for taking the time to complete this course and to those who provided their<br>technical expertise and efforts where VuPort was concerned. We would also like to encourage<br>you to continue to learn more about OPSEC.<br>(U//FOUO) On September 12, 2001, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz challenged<br>each of us with the immediate need to protect sensitive information and the importance of both<br>understanding and applying the process of OPSEC across the Department of Defense. His<br>challenge to the workforce was to:<br>Make OPSEC a priority.<br>Integrate OPSEC into training and awareness programs.<br>Ensure that force protection and operations planners are capable of recognizing the risks<br>associated with compromising critical information and countermeasures needed to mitigate those<br>risks.<br>Continually assess your ability to apply appropriate OPSEC practices to your daily mission.<br>(U//FOUO) Why is it important that we learn about OPSEC??<br>(U//FOUO) Operations Security is a tool that our adversaries believe in, and one that we as<br>government employees need to understand and integrate into our daily routine. Our work is<br>information, and not all of it is classified. We don't always realize how much we are giving away<br>by our predictable behavior, casual conversations, routines and other Internet information. We<br>must be careful of what we are revealing - failure to do so could provide our adversaries with<br>the information they need to execute additional terrorist acts.<br>(U//FOUO) The Director of Signals Intelligence expects all civilian, military, and contractor<br>personnel within the Signals Intelligence Directorate stationed at NSA or the field to integrate<br>OPSEC into all daily SID activities. This applies also to support organizations whose activities<br>impact SID operations.<br>(U//FOUO) Listed below are upcoming training opportunities that could help you to understand<br>more about OPSEC:<br>18-19 February 2004 - OPSEC 2330 - Threat Research for OPSEC <br>IOSS (Interagency OPSEC Support Staff), Greenbelt, MD <br>Registration through NCS<br>1-5 March 2004 - OPSEC 2380 OPSEC Practitioner's Course <br>IOSS, Greenbelt, MD <br>Registration through NCS<br>8-11 March 2004 - OPSEC 2390 - OPSEC Program Manager's Course <br>IOSS, Greenbelt, MD <br>Registration through NCS<br>5 April 2004 - OPSEC 1300 - OPSEC Fundamentals Course <br>IOSS, Greenbelt, MD <br>Registration through NCS<br><br> </p>14-15 April 2004 - OPSE 2350 OPSEC and Web Vulnerability <br>IOSS, Greenbelt, MD <br>Registration through NCS<br>7-11 June 2004 National OPSEC Conference &amp; Exhibition <br>Baltimore, MD <br>Fee: TBD <br>Registration: Nieto Engineering, Inc., <br>(U//FOUO) For further information on these and other upcoming training opportunities, please<br>see the IOSS web site ("go ioss").<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any questions, please contact your SID OPSEC Program Managers,<br> and<br>on<br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
