How does peacekeeping fit into U.S. national foreign policy? How will "donor fatigue"<br>factor into considerations for new missions?<br>(S) Peacekeeping is an important issue touching upon the majority of UN member nations -which are either recipients of a peacekeeping mission or contributors (troops and/or funding) to<br>such missions. Additionally, Support to the Warfighter includes Intelligence Needs associated<br>with peacekeeping. This seminar therefore holds relevance for a wide range of Intelligence and<br>Language Analysts across the SIGINT Directorate.
