Technology candidates
QFD consolidation and HAKIM

Existing QFD drawbacks

•	Some duplication between QFDs (~10%)

•	Need new QFDs to answer new questions

Need a consolidated database with multiple indexes and flexible additions

• HAKIM is a research prototype to do just that

•	Unification of data, associated data kept together

•	Quick and flexible addition of new data types and indexes

•	Scalable and cost effective

Other candidates exist and some HAKIM components could be replaced

•	Oracle DB or distributed, non-relational database?

•	Convergence with HADOOP stack HBASE/ACCUMULO

Engineering is working with research to develop to the next stage
