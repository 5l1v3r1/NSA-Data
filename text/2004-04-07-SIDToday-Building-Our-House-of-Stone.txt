Barton<br>Lead, SIGINT Requirements Analysis Center of Excellence (S01R)<br>Run Date: 04/07/2004<br>FROM: Kevan L. Barton <br>Lead, SIGINT Requirements Analysis Center of Excellence (S01R) <br>(U) People who have read the Department of Defense acquisition documents DoD 5000 and<br>CJCSM 3170 can't escape the terminology and sometimes find themselves in a mental<br>straitjacket just trying to figure out what the documents are saying. Folks working in a program<br>-- transformation or not -- are held by that same binding and may not even recognize it.<br>(U) One of those areas that gets confusing is the use of the term "architectures." It's not the<br>term itself that causes questions, but how the documents use it. It seems like a chicken and egg<br>problem, or even an infinite do-loop process. Thinking that the creation of new architectures is<br>built upon architectures, and how those architectures feed back to mature and then justify<br>themselves is just plain weird!<br>(U) The great bulk of what the agency builds, buys, or procures is IT-based in one way or<br>another. Therefore, it's logical that architectures are the fundamental means of communicating<br>the capability gap to the finders and builders of the solution to the gap. Just think in terms of<br>software engineering and the centricity of good designs! But, if this is truly understood, why<br>does DoD 5000 and CJCSM 3170 cause perplexed looks on the faces of so many involved in<br>engineering and acquisition? Maybe it's the problem of melding the two fields into a consistent,<br>well-understood process having the same goals.<br>(U//FOUO) SIGINT Requirement's Analysis Center of Excellence (SR ACE) stepped out a couple<br>of weeks ago (17-19 February 2004) and conducted a workshop on the "Analysis of<br>Conceptual Information Technology Based Systems." The workshop didn't attempt to<br>tackle all of the multi-various uses of the term architectures, but focused on them as the central<br>building blocks of constructing solutions that will bring the needed capabilities to NSA. The ACE<br>knows that program analysis is a requirement in all we do, i.e. the statutory and regulatory<br>aspects of conducting an Analysis of Alternatives, but recognizes the lack of knowledge and<br>experience in carrying out such analysis.<br>(U) The workshop was attended by folks from all over the United States and within the DoD<br>community and focused on sharing information on the methodologies, tools, process, and<br>techniques in assessing and analyzing conceptual IT-based systems. It also included briefs on<br>the expectations of the JROC and Program Analysis and Evaluation (OSD PA&amp;E). The goal was to<br>bring to the NSA the best of what's out there so that our own processes can be matured and a<br>program analysis culture can be institutionalized. This can only increase our ability to bring<br>needed capability to the users more quickly and completely.<br>(U//FOUO) The briefs from the workshop have been posted. Do you want to know what PA&amp;E<br>expects from our programs? Do you need to understand "3170" a bit better? How about<br>squeezing performance data out of DoDAF (DoD Architecture Framework) in ways that you'd<br>never expect? Do you know which DoDAF view is the central design product of any set of DoDAF<br>products? Or, are you simply wanting to understand the problems of costing? These are just a<br>few of the answers you can find. Go exploring! So successful was the workshop, that we've<br>already got another planned for Oct of 2004. Perhaps we'll see you there.<br>(U) Appropriate use and understanding of architectures are just two of the stones that build a<br>strong foundation for acquisition.<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
