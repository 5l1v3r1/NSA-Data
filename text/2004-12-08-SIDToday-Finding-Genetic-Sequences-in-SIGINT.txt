DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S//SI) Finding Genetic Sequences in SIGINT<br>FROM: <br>Cryptanalysis Development Program Participant<br>Run Date: 12/08/2004<br><br>A cryptanalysis intern describes an unusual tour in Analysis &amp; Production (S2). (U//FOUO)<br>(S//SI) The Office of Tradecraft for Analysis ( S211A -- housed in the Advanced Analysis Lab)<br>partners with other government agencies, academia, and private corporations to develop SIGINT<br>analysis tradecraft and doctrine. OTA is made up of people with backgrounds ranging from<br>analysis to engineering (and just about everything in between), working on problems related to<br>how we do analysis. They address questions such as, "How can we best discover group<br>structures and/or hierarchies from call graph metadata?" and "How do we identify unknown<br>unknowns?" ... Practically speaking, what does that mean?<br>(S//SI) For a member of the Cryptanalysis Development Program ( CADP ), this means that OTA<br>provides the unique opportunity to apply cryptanalytic skills to a significantly different problem<br>set than that found in traditional CA tours. When I started my tour in the Lab, they were looking<br>for someone to take on the problem of how to detect genetic sequences in SIGINT. The ultimate<br>goals of this project are to gain general knowledge about genetic engineering research activity<br>by foreign entities and to identify laboratories and/or individuals who may be involved in<br>nefarious use of genetic research. As a signature of advanced laboratory activity and a strong<br>indicator of the kind of research being peformed, the sequences are expected to lead us to that<br>information.<br>(S//SI) I used many of the skills I learned in CA classes such as statistical analysis, and wrote<br>several programs to test different algorithms, much like I had in my diagnosis tour. I also grew<br>professionally by giving briefings to our customer and other interested groups, attending<br>conferences (both in-house and external), and gaining a broader sense of the SIGINT system by<br>partnering with another office. By teaming with the Technical Exploitation Center ( TEC, S31123<br>) we tested our most accurate algorithms in the front-end environment. This allowed us to<br>identify the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms that should be addressed in the final<br>software product we implement in collection.<br>(U//FOUO) I thoroughly enjoyed my tour in OTA, and found it extremely rewarding to attack this<br>unique problem with such success.
