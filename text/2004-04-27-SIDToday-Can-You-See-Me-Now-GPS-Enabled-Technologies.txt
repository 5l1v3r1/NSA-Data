The next era, "Can you see me now?", has arrived. Numerous devices using Global<br>Positioning Systems (GPS) for determining their location have proliferated across every part of<br>society. These devices are not only able to transmit their location information, but also receive<br>location information from similar devices. Imagine being able to see where all of your buddies<br>are located when planning a lunch. You could overlay the locations of Chinese restaurants in the<br>area, select the best or closest one, and send that location to your buddies. Well, that time is<br>already here.<br>(U//FOUO) GPS-based systems, and similar technologies, enable us to know many things such<br>as:<br>where am I;<br>where are my buddies;<br>where is my car;<br>where is my boat;<br>where are other boats in my area.<br>(U//FOUO) Obviously, these are just a few examples, and the amount of information from these<br>types of devices has exploded recently, resulting in an "Information Tsunami." This huge wave<br>of information is only going to grow larger. As costs of Global Positioning Systems become more<br>affordable, these devices will be integrated into our daily life and become an increasingly<br>invisible service that we come to rely on for even the simplest of tasks.<br>(S//SI) One of the first examples of the global use of this type of technology is the ITU-R<br>M.1371-1 recommendation jointly developed by the International Telecommunication Union<br>(ITU) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) and known in the public domain as<br>Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS is a standard that governs the means for<br>transmitting and receiving information on a ship's position, course, speed, name, type of cargo,<br>size, destination, etc. It also provides a framework for extending the basic capability to include<br>TELEX messages, ship way points, and gives vendors the capability to provide proprietary<br>services to ships outfitted with its equipment.<br>(S//SI) AIS-derived SIGINT is already available to the SIGINT production chain, with<br>dissemination limited under interim OGC (Office of the General Counsel) guidance. Although<br>significant legal and policy hurdles remain, SIGINT exploitation of AIS is already a success in<br>terms of grappling with widespread self-disclosure technologies. Exploitation of AIS exemplifies<br>how NSA, as a Combat Support Agency, can help assure information superiority by providing<br>precise and timely geopositions far beyond the range of most tactical sensors -- allowing not<br>only enhanced Force Protection but also setting the stage for automated correlation of<br>unidentified commercial radar intercepts to specific vessels.<br>(S//SI) And this is just the beginning. NSA's Joint PROFORMA Center (JPC) is the Executive<br>Agent for developing these new technologies. The JPC is responsible for the technical analysis,<br>oversight of the processor architecture, coordination of data dissemination, and is the<br>Intelligence Community's SIGINT focal point for these systems. JPC will help provide an<br>unprecedented level of detailed information on the location and movements of high value assets<br>including people, ships, cargo, etc. for support in the global war on terrorism and support to<br>military operations worldwide.
