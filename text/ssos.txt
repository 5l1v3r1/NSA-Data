What is SSO Corporate access collection?

(TS//SI//NF) Access and collection of telecommunications on cable, switch network,
and/or routers made possible by the partnerships Involving NSA and commercial
telecommunications companies.

3

Brief discussion of global telecommunications infrastructure.

How access points in the US can collect on communications from "bad guy" countries
(least cost routing, etc.)

4

(TS//SI//NF) Key Points:

1)	SSO provides more than 80% of collection for NSA. SSO's Corporate Portfolio
represents a large portion of this collection.

2)	Because of the partners and access points, the Corporate Portfolio is governed by
several different legal authorities (Transit, FAA, FISA, E012333), some of which
are extremely time-intensive.

3)	Because of partner relations and legal authorities, SSO Corporate sites are often
controlled by the partner, who filters the communications before sending to NSA.

4)	Because we go through partners and do not typically have direct access to the
systems, it can take some time for OCTAVE/UTT/Cadence tasking to be updated
at site (anywhere from weekly for some BLARNEY accesses to a few hours for
STORMBREW).

Explanation of how we can collect on a call between (hypothetically) Iran and Brazil
using Transit Authority.

Discuss how forelgn-to-forelgnness must be proved (particularly difficult for DNI).

6

•(S//SI) Transit Authority - Only allows those SSO programs operating under this
authority to collect communications which are confirmed to be forelgn-to-forelgn.

•	(S//SI) SSO programs operating under this authority have filters at their collection
front-ends to ensure only authorized traffic (I.e. foreign-to-forelgn) Is forwarded to
the DNR and DNI selection engines (driven by UTT/CADENCE/OCTAVCE tasking).

•	(S//SI) Despite best efforts, occasionally there may be an "authorized" DNR or DNI
hit forwarded to the TOPI, which based on TOPI analysis eventually determines that
one-end of the Intercept Is actually in the US. We refer to this as a "domestic
Incident". This usually occurs In the DNR world, where one-end of the Intercept will
make a reference to being In the US.

•	(C) TOPI's must inform SSO Corp Team when this occurs via email alias
^^^^^^SSO files a formal report to NSA/SV for each occurrence of a domestic
incident.

Systems under a corporate program can be completely unrelated to one another
(e.g., everything In OAKSTAR Is different).

*MONKEYROCKET Is expected to become operational In spring 2012.
Blue-colored systems operate under Transit Authority.

US-3150 Is an umbrella SSO SIGAD for the Extended Enterprise.

Key points:

1)	Explanation of Port 25 and 3-Swing Algorithm.

2)	60 million foreign-to-foreign emails in the FAIRVIEW environment ever day; 5
million after 3-Swing Algorithm.

3)	FAA collection under SIGADs US-984XR and US-984X2. FISA collection under
SIGAD US-984T (COWBOY).

4)	Tasking through UTT, Cadence, and OCTAVE.

5)	Data in PINWALE (YANKEE), XKEYSCORE, MAINWAY, TOYGRIPPE, BLACKPEARL,
TWISTEDPATH, NUCLEON, and DISHFIRE.

Discussion of the breadth of the FAIRVIEW program.

TOP

(TS//SI) US-983 (PDDG-FL) - key corporate partner with
access to international cables, routers, and switches

(TS//SI) Key Targets: Global

(C) DNR Collection: (Directory ONMR)

(C) DNI Collection: Limited to FAA and FISA

Cyber hit counts on FAA DNI Access

TOP

Key Points:

1)	Access to mid-point collection (cable, switch, and router) at seven sites and
approximately 130 circuits.

2)	DNR collection falls under Transit and FAA Authorities. DNI is limited to FAA and
FISA - cannot collect DNI under Transit Authority like FAIRVIEW.

3)	Difference between WFIITESQUALL (international gateway switch access;
thousands of trunk groups connected worldwide), MISTRALWIND (calling card/
private network access), SERRATEDEDGE (conflict number access)

4)	STORMBREW collects under the FAA Authority using the SIGADs US-984X(A-FI) for
DNI and US-984X1.

5)	STORMBREW handles limited FISA-related tasking using the SIGAD US-984P
(PERFECTSTORM) and PDDG AX.

6)	STORMBREW is tasked in UTT and OCTAVE.

7)	Data is retrieved in PINWALE, NUCLEON, and DISHFIRE.

(TS//SI//NF) STORMBREW collection comes from eight sites connected by a DS3 ring.

New access under the STORMBREW umbrella.

MADCAPOCELOT has access to multiple 10G Internet backbone circuits, Including
that	the^^^^^^^^J

Three-step tasking process: 1) an unclassified IP address and signature promotion
list will be reviewed and approved by S2/S3 GCM equity process, 2) strong
selection will be accomplished by UTT site group (SSO_WO), 3) filtering and
targeting logic managed by TMM will be levied via a new CADENCE dictionary
MADCAPOCELOT and CADENCE FIST MDCP.

4) Collection can be accessed in PINWALE (TEXT partition) and metadata is accessed
in MARINA.

US-984 BLARNEY

(TS//SI) US-984 (PDDG: AX) - provides collection
against DNR and DNI FISA Court Order authorized
communications.

(TS//SI) Key Targets: Diplomatic establishment,
counterterrorism, Foreign Government, Economic

(U//FOUO) “go BLARNEY” for more information.

1)	Operates under the authorities of NSA FISA, FBI FISA, and FAA.

2)	BLARNEY Is the leading source of FISA collection, producing over 11,000 reports
and is consistently a top contributor to the President's Daily Brief. The program
contributes to over 60% of product reporting to the Counterterrorism product
line and over 80% of the overall FAA reporting.

3)	In order to task BLARNEY, there must a valid Court Order for the target. Court
order process:

1)	Court Order is signed or renewed.

2)	Selectors appear in the Court Order.

3)	Target Office decides what numbers to task. The Target Office submits a

Managers with the selectors that should be tasked.

4)	When a Court Order is up for renewal and a currently tasked number is
not going to be in the renewal, the TOPI is required to send a detask
request for that selector.

4)	11 different SIGADs, falling under BLARNEY, FAIRVIEW, and STORMBREW partners.

5)	PRISM falls under BLARNEY, but is just one access of many.

6)	The Court Order process is extremely long and time-intensive for everyone

involved, but the collection payout is fantastic.

1) FAA Collection falls under BLARNEY, FAIRVIEW, STORMBREW, or SILVERZEPHYR
(OAKSTAR), but due to the stringent legal requirements of FAA, the programs use
different SIGADs (under the format US-984X*).

Look at FAA. Just look at it.
