One<br>of the biggest challenges on a long-standing hard target like North Korea is that as numerous<br>initiatives are pursued and dropped over the years, creative minds can become frustrated and<br>stale. Therefore, in an effort to generate a fresh perspective and some "out-of-the-box" thinking<br>and proposals, the Korea Issue Manager Team (KIMT) recently partnered with administrators of<br>the SIGINT Collection Management course (COL603) at the Joint Military Intelligence College<br>(JMIC), Masters of Science of Strategic Intelligence program.<br>(S//SI) The goal was to involve members of the class (mostly non-SIGINTers) in a mini-ROCK<br>DRILL focused on reconstitution and integration of national and tactical U.S. and South Korean<br>SIGINT collection should war resume on the Korean Peninsula. Members of the class, though<br>limited in SIGINT expertise, were extremely bright and ambitious military and civilian<br>intelligence personnel ready to tackle the challenge.<br>(S//SI) The idea to partner on a real-world issue such as North Korea originated with the JMIC<br>course administrators and was quickly recognized by the KIMT as a powerful tool to develop new<br>approaches to one of the longest standing SIGINT target challenges in NSA's history. To launch<br>the initiative, the KIMT provided the class with an overview of the United Nations<br>Command/Combined Forces Command go-to-war plans, OPLANs 5026 and 5027, and the two<br>wartime collection scenarios the team wanted them to address. These very same scenarios were<br>simultaneously to be addressed by over 50 SIGINT experts assembled in Seoul, Korea for North<br>Korea ROCK DRILL 5 . The class spent the next five weeks researching the problem and<br>developing proposals to optimize SIGINT collection and interoperability under wartime<br>conditions. At the end of this period, they presented their findings to the KIMT.<br>(U//FOUO) The results of the initiative went far beyond the expectations of the KIMT, or the<br>course administrators for that matter. The class identified at least three new, unique collection<br>initiatives to close anticipated wartime information gaps, which the KIMT will pursue. The<br>remainder of the proposals tracked directly with those generated by the SIGINT experts at<br>ROCK DRILL 5.<br>(U//FOUO) The KIMT is extremely pleased by the thoughtfulness, hard work and creativity of the<br>JMIC students. The President of the Joint Military Intelligence College, Mr. A. Denis Clift, was<br>similarly impressed with this initiative, comparing it favorably to a Harvard Business School case<br>study model approach to learning. The KIMT looks forward to future partnerships with the JMIC!<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, contact the IMT members:<br>Tim Miner<br>Liz Brooks (<br><br> <br><br>@nsa, NSTS<br>@nsa, NSTS <br>@nsa, NSTS <br><br>),<br>) or<br><br>) of the KIMT.<br><br>NSA JMIC Adjunct Faculty Member and/or Daniel S.
