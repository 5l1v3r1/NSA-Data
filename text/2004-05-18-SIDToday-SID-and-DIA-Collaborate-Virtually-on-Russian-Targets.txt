The DIA analyst makes use of his outstanding<br>language and research skills to search for, locate, and subsequently database references to<br>Russian military and civilian organizations that NSA and DIA both follow.<br>(TS//SI) Through his interaction with the NSA analysts, the DIA analyst has developed an<br>excellent sense of what kinds of lead information would be valuable in SIGINT targeting. He is<br>mindful of the need for key telephone numbers and other contact information, street addresses<br>and other geolocation information, and names of key individuals as he combs a wide range of<br>newspapers, government decrees, and obscure websites for information on their mutual targets.<br>(TS//SI) The NSA analysts have used these leads to improve SIGINT collection against Russian<br>hard and deeply buried targets, leadership, nuclear weapons, and military targets. The NSA<br>analysts share with their DIA colleague their expertise on Russian defense industrial, leadership,<br>and state security issues, discuss the significance of open source findings and help sharpen DIA's<br>focus. The three analysts compare notes on a daily or near-daily basis by phone or via e-mail,<br>serving as one another's sounding board for analytic hunches and conclusions.<br>(TS//SI) The close collaboration between the NSA analysts and the DIA analyst has been critical<br>to the efforts of the Yamantau Working Group - an Intelligence Community (IC) initiative set up<br>to solve the long-standing issue of the intended purpose of the hard and deeply buried facility at<br>Yamantau Mountain, in Russia's southern Ural Mountains. Thanks to this unique partnership, the<br>IC has a clearer understanding of the specific Russian organizations responsible for managing<br>the Yamantau project and our targeting against these entities has improved immeasurably.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
