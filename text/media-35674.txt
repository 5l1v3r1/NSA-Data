Beginnings of DTN: Epidemic (U)

• 2000: Epidemic Routing - Vahdat and Becker

•	Nodes exchange "summary vectors"

. Each node sends the data that the other node lacks

•	Summary vectors implemented as a Bloom Filter

•	Followed by Immunity concept: Resource and performance tradeoffs
in deiay-toierant wireless networks, 2005; Small and Haas

Covert Communications (TS//SI//REL)



•	(TS//SI//REL) Provide covert comms in denied areas
where no infrastructure exists, or where using the
infrastructure would compromise the operation.

•	(S//REL) Several "brush-pass" wireless hand-offs as
an untraceable alternative to scheduled meetings,
dead drops.

(Not So) Close Access

•	(TS//SI//REL) Retrieving data from an
implant without visiting the implant
ourselves

•	(TS//SI//REL) Need to add DTN link
capability to the implant

•	(S//REL) Data mule may be unaware of
their role

STRAITBIZZARE (U)

•	(TS//SI//REL) Cross-platform implant built using TAO's
CHIMNEYPOOL framework

-	Ports for Linux, Windows, etc..

-	Endpoint-centric : focused on file exfil from a PC

-	Remote Procedure Call (RPC) based

•	(TS//SI//REL) FRIEZERAMP protocol provides covert
networking

-	CHIMNEYPOOL comms module

-	Similar to IP, IPsec

-	Only supports static network configuration

•	(TS//SI//REL) FRIEZERAMP links are adapters to
converge FR packets onto the transport layer below

-	Examples : https, udp, smtp, etc.

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

Put SBZ on each device ... right?

(TS//SI//REL)

•	(TS//SI//REL) File exfil CP modules and FRIEZERAMP
treats reliability as only an end-to-end issue

-	FR retransmissions are requested by the receiver
and only the sender can retransmit

-	Hop-by-hop reliability is desirable

•	(TS//SI//REL) Persistent storage module only waits until
link is available then "send and forget"

•	(U//FOUO) All routes are static and setup a priori

•	(TS//SI//REL) Operationally, SBZ on each device is
undesirable in some CONOPs

Ultra-lightweight BPA (TS//SI//REL)

■ (TS//SI//REL)	has been building

an ultra-lightweight BPA that can act as a CP
link to a DTN

•	(U//FOUO) Locally provides data persistence,
discovery, routing, convergence layers

•	(TS//SI//REL) FR packets are already
fragmented, so this BPA does not need to be as
flexible as others

•	(S//REL)Can add covert Convergence Layer

Static Routing Background (U)

•	Bundle Protocol Nodes are identified by Endpoint
Identifiers (EIDs) that look like:

dtn://dtnbone.umd.edu.dtn/

dtn://nodea.dtn/

ebr://group5.dtn/

•	Convergence Layer connections to neighbors are
called "Links"

- For example a TCP connection to a neighbor is a link

•	Each link knows the EID of the neighbor associated
with it

DTN Routing Bonanza (U)

(U//FOUO) People propose routing protocols for many
different environments and purposes.

- Sometimes with novel applications, sometimes with no
real need

(U) Has inspired the phrase "Yet Another Routing Protocol"

• (U//FOUO) Delay-Tolerant Link State Routing

-	Assumes a mostly stable contact graph

-	Nodes all flood their recent contacts

-	Each node maintains an internal picture of the
network, and makes routing decisions based on
Dijkstra's alg

Bundle Security Protocol RFC 6257 (U)

•	(U) Provides bundle-layer encryption,
authentication, and data integrity

•	(U) Lack of connectivity affects choice
of algorithms and services

•	(U) Security polices may be directional

•	(U//FOUO) Managing keys and their
accompanying policies is a challenge

■	May prevent DoS through too many connections

(U//FOUO) Enable different groups of nodes to operate in
the same area but maintain separation
