(U) Lesson 4: So you got U.S. Person Information?

How?	What did you do?	What do you do now?	Comment
Intentional	You deliberately targeted U.S. Person communications without authority.	•	Stop collection immediately!  •	Cancel reports based on that collect.  •	Notify your supervisor or auditor.  •	Write up an incident report immediately.  •	Submit the incident write-up for inclusion in your organization’s IG Quarterly input.	You may not target, collect, or disseminate U.S. person information without additional authority.  If collect on U.S. Person is needed, seek additional authority if eligible and a valid foreign intelligence requirement.
Inadvertent	You tasked/queried in raw SIGINT on a target you believed to be foreign. You then learned the target is a U.S. Person.	•	Stop collection immediately!  •	Cancel reports based on that collect.  •	Notify your supervisor or auditor.  •	Write up an incident report immediately.  •	Submit the incident write-up for inclusion in your organization’s IG Quarterly input.	If collect on U.S. Person is needed, seek additional authority if eligible and a valid foreign intelligence requirement.
Incidental	You targeted a legitimate foreign entity and acquired information/ communications to/from/about a U.S. Person in your results.	•	Apply USSID SP0018 minimization procedures.  •	Focus your report on the foreign end of the communication.  •	Obtain dissemination authority if you know your customer set requires the U.S. Person identity up front.	This does not constitute a USSID SP0018 violation, so it does not have to be reported in the IG quarterly.
Reverse	You targeted a foreign entity who you know communicates with a U.S. Person on a regular basis just so you can get the communications of the U.S. Person.	•	Stop collection immediately!  •	Cancel reports based on that collect.  •	Notify your supervisor or auditor.  •	Write up an incident report immediately.  •	Submit the incident write-up for inclusion in your organization’s IG Quarterly input.	You may not reverse target.  If collect on U.S. Person is needed, seek additional authority if eligible and a valid foreign intelligence requirement.
