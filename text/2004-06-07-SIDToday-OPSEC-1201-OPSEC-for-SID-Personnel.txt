We are pleased to announce the availability of OPSEC 1201 OPSEC for SID Personnel, to be offered on your desktop via VuPort. The SID Training Authority<br>announced this course in a SID-all email on 3 JUN 04 .<br>(U) The course will cover OPSEC history, the elements of OPSEC, and the OPSEC process. The<br>majority of the OPSEC theoretical information has not changed much over the years, so this<br>shouldn't be new to you.<br>(U) The course will cover your roles and responsibilities towards OPSEC in light of the new public<br>NSA/CSS environment. Then it will look at your adjusted roles and responsibilities as reflected<br>by the War on Terrorism. The next step will take you through a real-world example of a SIGINT<br>operation in a non-conventional location.<br>(U) Enrollment: This course is available via the NCS Technology-based delivery platform,<br>Vuport. To access this course, type "go Vuport" in the location dialog box of your web browser,<br>or click on the following - <br> . Type in your Vuport ID and password and<br>click on LOGIN. Then click on WebTrain and on to the OPSEC, where you should be able to<br>register for the course. Visually impaired should contact the NCS for a text version of the course.<br>(U) It is our hope after completing OPSEC 1201 you will have a better understanding of OPSEC<br>and how you can apply the process to your daily mission. With the constant threat that we are<br>experiencing, it is more important than ever to apply OPSEC to your daily practices both in work<br>and home situations.<br>(U) For more information, contact<br>Managers on <br><br>or<br><br>OPSEC Program<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
