Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for<br>instructions.<br>(U) Course Overview:<br>(U//FOUO) A discussion of the potential costs and possible outcomes of modern conventional<br>state-on-state warfare. Modern conventional warfare has taken on new dimensions as a result of<br>a modern "revolution in the military arts." This revolution is the current version of an on-going<br>series of fundamental changes in the way wars are fought now -- and into the future. However,<br>revolutionary weapons systems, strategies and tactics do not necessarily result in assured<br>military outcomes, nor can the weapons systems "costs" be measured simply in monetary units.<br>The presentation and discussion will seek to look at this "Revolution" and provide the<br>participants with a broad understanding of the military and political challenges of modern<br>conventional warfare in the 21st century.<br>(S) This brown bag session is classified (TS//SI).
