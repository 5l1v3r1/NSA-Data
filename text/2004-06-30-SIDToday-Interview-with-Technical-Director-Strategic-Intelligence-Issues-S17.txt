It was a small office of about<br>six people that handled any specially compartmented intelligence about the Soviet Navy. In<br>those days, some types of material were compartmented that today are not; e.g. regular<br>imagery was compartmented at that time.<br>(U) What are some of the best opportunities you've had in your career?<br>(S//SI) In the 1980's, I participated in naval war games, in which I got to play the part of a<br>Soviet commander. This tested my knowledge of Soviet doctrine, but also gave me insights into<br>how the U.S. military uses SIGINT for planning. I encourage everyone to participate in such war<br>games if they have the chance.<br>(S//SI) I also worked on task forces in the 1990's, such as one that assessed the CBRN<br>(Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) threat to the U.S. I worked with some extremely<br>smart people -- experts in the field -- and found it a great experience to learn and contribute at<br>a high level. Such opportunities are one of the best aspects of a career in SIGINT.<br>(U) What has been the biggest change you've seen in the Agency during your career?<br>(U//FOUO) That's an easy one: computers! Early in my career, we were still writing reports by<br>hand and delivering them to a typing pool. Some of my reports were quite long (over 100<br>handwritten pages), and it would take a couple of days for the typists to get it all down. Since it<br>was not possible to manipulate text the way we can now, you had to give greater thought to<br>what you wanted to say, and how, before you picked up the pencil. We also took pity on the<br>typists and tried to write neatly!<br>(U) What projects for the future are you excited about?<br>(S//SI) For one, I think that the use of issue management teams (IMTs), which seek to optimize<br>SIGINT against important issues, will pay great dividends in the future. I also think that<br>"knowledge sharing" will flower in years to come. This involves deploying out into the workforce<br>the tools that will allow them to easily share information with other subject matter experts. We<br>have the technology to do this, but it will require a cultural change to get everyone accustomed<br>to routinely sharing information with everyone who can benefit from it. I've been involved with<br>both of these initiatives in recent years, and I'm optimistic about their future.<br>(U) Overall, what was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(S//SI) The best experience was my PCS to GCHQ in Cheltenham, England from 1977 to 1982.<br>My work in the Combined Naval Party, where I was the only NSA civilian, was very rewarding.<br>As an added benefit, the countrified lifestyle in the Cotswolds region made it a wonderful place<br>for a young family to live. We liked it so much, I asked to extend my tour.<br>(U) In terms of the most important event, that would be the letter I received about 31 years ago<br><br> </p>confirming that I had been hired to work at NSA. It's tempting to wonder what my life would be<br>like if I had taken a different path, but I can say I'm very satisfied with how everything worked<br>out as a result of my coming to work at the Agency.<br>(U) We wish<br><br> the best in his retired life!<br><br>(U) See other interviews in this series:<br>Interview with...
