SUMMARY

PURPOSE: (TS//SI//NF) To obtain SID approval for Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES)
cryptanalysts at the NSA/CSS Cryptologic Centers (CCs) in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii, who are
under direct DIRNSA authority, to access and process NSA SIGINT FISA and CT FBI SIGINT
FISA data that is stored in databases in CES at NSAW. This will set a precedent for access to NSA
FISA material outside of NSAW.

BACKGROUND: (TS//SI) As part of CES’s strategy for the Extended Enterprise buildout,
cryptanalysis efforts at the cryptologic centers in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will serve as
transparent extensions of the cryptanalysis mission performed by CES in the Office of Target
Pursuit’s exploitation branches (S31142, S31143, S31131, and S31133) at NSAW. Analysts at the
cryptologic centers will become part of a virtual team with NSAW analysts. They will access data
that is stored within the CES firewall and will use cryptanalytic procedures and tools, also within
the CES firewall, b}r way of a VPN capability that ensures that security is not compromised and
that the data and tools accessed cannot get out to the local network. The priorities of cryptanalytic
missions will continue to be set in conjunction with mission elements at NSAW and the Cryptologic
Centers as appropriate.

(TS//SI) Cryptanalysts at the cryptologic centers will access data that is stored in the following
databases at NSAW:

FOURSCORE - fax and DNI data, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived
ZAP - text, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived
CAPRICORN - voice, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived

SOAPOPERA - voice, end product, SRI information, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived

(TS//SI) These databases contain raw data, including enciphered collection, and, when exploitation
is possible, decrypted plain text. Some of the data in the databases is NSA FISA-derived or FBI CT
FISA-derived. While not every database contains FISA-derived material, it is reasonable to expect
that analysts at the CCs will perform mission with agility, moving across targets and databases as
mission demands, and that sometimes that will mean accessing data within a database that does
contain FISA-derived data. Access to these databases is restricted to analysts who hold the
RAGTIME ECI, have a specific 'need to know' about the data stored within the databases, and who
are authorized by the data owner. For some years CES has been the recipient of improperly
marked/classified data but all analysts have been and are aware that data marked with the SIGAD
US984J and case notation XX.SQF* is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD
US-984* is NSA FISA data. CES believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the
classification of the data before it is fed into our systems. This is an ongoing issue which should not
impede the approval of this SPF but the matter should be addressed. CES will ensure that all
analysts accessing these databases know that data marked with the SIGAD US984J and case
notation XX.SQF* is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD US-984* is NSA
FISA data, and that this data should be classified TOP SECRET//COMINT - ECI RAGTIME//
NOFORN. Ideally all FISA and non-FISA material should be held separately, and FBI and NSA
FISA should be partitioned by individual target. The Office of Oversight and Compliance will work
with S3 dataflow and Special Source Operations to correct the markings/classification of data at the
front end.

(S//SI) CES at NSAW will work to ensure that all individuals working the cryptanalysis mission at
the CCs have the appropriate clearances for access to sensitive data, including RAGTIME, and will
dictate specific policy and procedural security measures.

REQUIREMENTS: (TS//SI//NF) Following recent meetings and discussions among SID Oversight
and Compliance (SV) and NSAW CES, the following are recommendations and requirements that
CES and the Cryptologic Centers should agree to implement prior to accessing, handling,
processing, retaining, and disseminating NSA FISA and CT FBI FISA-derived collection.

SV requirements; NSA/CSS TX, NSA/CSS GA, and NSA/CSS HI should commit to:

1) (S//SI) The creation of a permanent FISA coordinator position, to be staffed initially by a
person experienced with FISA procedures, to ensure compliance with FISA minimization
procedures; build a culture and climate of FISA awareness; and facilitate on-site ability to train,
field questions, and handle time-sensitive FISA issues.

(S//SI) NSA/CSS TX has identified a permanent FISA coordinator; however that
person has no FISA experience. The CES Mission Manager at TX, who has FISA experience, must
perform oversight of CES activities and must participate in the new coordinator’s FISA training.
SID Oversight & Compliance will brief both individuals on their responsibilities.

S3109-080-06

(TS//SI//NF) NSA/CSS GA and NSA/CSS HI have permanent FISA coordinators who
have been supporting the Counterterrorism analytic mission. CES must work with those persons to
ensure oversight of CES activities. The FISA coordinators will ensure consistent FISA oversight
across all Cryptologic Center activities.

2)	(S//SI) The creation of a core FISA workforce which, at ail times, contains a stable body of
personnel who ideally have at least one year’s experience working FISA. A stable, non-transient
workforce ensures a well-founded culture for FISA, as has been established at NSAW over many
years. Such a culture minimizes the number of FISA-related violations by reinforcing the
requirements» restrictions, and sensitivities of accessing and processing FISA.

(S//SI) The CES Mission Managers at Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii have FISA
experience and will have supervisory responsibilities over all CES employees at those sites. CES
will ensure that all cryptanalysts at Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will be trained on how to perforin
the CES mission and on how to handle sensitive materials; all will be knowledgeable about USSID
SP0018 and Annex A that describes FISA handling.

3)	(S//SI) Provide assurances and documentation that the on-site physical layout of
terminals and the means to secure the FISA material is such that access is restricted to only
cleared personnel with a need for access to the FISA data.

(S//SI) Seating for individuals performing the cryptanalysis mission will be clustered
together to ensure that they have visual and acoustical privacy for technical conversations and to
ensure that their conversations and the data displayed on their computer screens is neither
accessible nor viewable by those who do not have the appropriate clearances and a “need-to-know”.
In addition, these individuals will have one or more dedicated printers and combination safes for
storage of any authorized FISA material.

4)	(S//SI) Provide assurances that FISA material will not be revealed or disseminated as part
of site briefings or demonstrations, or in any other format, unless it conforms to and is handled in
accordance with FISA Court requirements and minimization procedures approved by the Attorney
General, and NSA dissemination policies and procedures. Due to the sensitivity of the sources and
methods used to obtain this collection, it cannot be shared with site visitors or other uncleared
personnel without proper minimization and attribution to protect those sources and methods.

QGC requirements:

(S//SI) Except in exigent circumstances, all personnel that will have access to FISA material should
receive initial OGC USSID SP0018 and FBI FISA minimization briefings in person. The briefings
given by OGC are interactive in nature and the personal setting gives OGC a better opportunity to
interact with all participants. When in person briefings are not possible, briefings will be done via
VTC.

RECOMMENDATION: (U) SIGINT DIR concur on access with oversighl as described.

TO: (U) S1GINT Director

SUBJ: (S) Recommended Requirements for Cryptanalysts at
CCs at Texas, Georgia and Hawaii to access NSA ami FBI
MSA matcriaJ.

(I S//SI) This request will set a precedent as no prior request
for access to NSA FISA material outside NSAW lias been
approved. NSA FISA is SIGINT derival from NSA’s own
submissions to the US FISA Court. An individual in SID
Oversight and Compliance (SV). in a personally sworn
declaration to the US FISA Court, assures the Court that all
individuals, wherever located and in any job (linguist,
erytpanalysi. reporter, collector, etc.), who access or use NSA
MSA material are trained and will comply with all NSA
obligations attached to this sensitive access.

< I'S'/SI) While SV supports the S3/CES build out to the
Cryptologic Centers in principle. SV lias learned that there arc-
existing deficiencies in classification and handling of NSA
I ISA and FBI FISA material in CES’s databases that must be
addressed and fixed before additional access at the CCs is
approved.

(TS'/SI) It is vital that both NSA FISA and FBI FISA material
be properly and separately identified so that I) users of that
material know that they arc accessing NSA FISA or FBI FISA,
and 2) NSA can remain in compliance with Department of
Justice and all other obligations for FISA handling and
minimization. It is possible ilwt there are already FISA
violations resulting from the way data iuis been stored in these
databases and it is cntical (hat these problems be fixed before
■he problems are spread to new locally rm	, K

OetUutr> Or 20291123

TOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123

TOP SECRET//COJVIINT//20291123

(TS'.'SI) For example, the databases FOURSCORI: and ZAP
contain both NSA FISA and FBI FISA that does not carry the
appropriate classification (all NSA and FBI FISA material
must carry the "TS//S1-EC1 RGTVNOFORN /2029123*’
classification. FBI FISA should also be marked with the
OGC-approvcd FBI FISA banner,) Further, NSA FISA and
FBI FISA materials are mixed together within the databases,
despite the differences in allowed retention between the two
versions of FISA, and both arc mixed with non-FIS A
material. CHS should also provide SV with an SOP clan tying
how access (by both CHS and S2 target analysts) to these
target folders is maintained, including what checks are m
place to verify user clearances to view NSA FISA and/or FBI
FISA material.

(TS//S1) If you support access in principle. I would
recommend (hat no action be taken to establish accounts at the
CCs for these CES databases until SV can ensure that the
issues of classification, partitioning and access are resolved
and any existing FISA access or retention violations are
identified and cleared up.

(TS//S1) Further, SV recommends tliat this access not be
approved until S3/CES and the Cryptologic Centers involved
coordinate with the offices that sponsored the NSA FISA
court orders and agree to the responsibilities that each will
have relative to satisfying the FISA minimization procedures
(USSII) SHOO 18, Annex A). This is necessary to ensure that
all individuals who touch NSA FISA material personally
abide by NSA's FISA handling and minimization
requirements, ensure that no one makes erroneous
assumptions about what another office is doing vis-a-vis
meeting those requirements, and ensure that the NSA
declarant can swear under oath that NSA abides by its
obligations.
