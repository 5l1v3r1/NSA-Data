(U//FOUO) Typical SIG1NT Data Calls/Questions

How many sites do we have in the region? How many records are they
producing?

2. What type of coverage do we have on country X?

What type of collection and volume do we get out of site A? How do these
types/volumes compare against site B? Against site C?

(U//FOUO) Wavs to Get Answers

1. Map out the physical location of SIGINT assets

Send out a data call based on best guesses for who can answer the
question

Review static reports/spreadsheets from previous data calls
4. Ask a 30-year SIGINTer

(U//FOUO) Use Big Data technology to query SIGINT collection in the cloud to
produce near real-time business intelligence describing the agency’s available
SIGINT infrastructure and coverage.

(U//FOUO) Key Questions

1 Flow many records are collected for an organizational unit (e.g. fornsat) or
country?

2.	Are there any visible trends?

3.	What assets collect against a specific country? What type of collection?

Details

(U//FOUO) Current focus is on SIGINT/COMINT

(U//FOUO) Review every valid DNI and DNR metadata record passing
through the NSA SIGINT infrastructure

a)	(U//FOUO) For the Map View, only display aggregated counts of records with a
normalized number or an administrative region populated.

b)	(U//FOUO) For the Org View, display aggregated counts of every valid record.

(U//FOUO) Raw data, analytics, and back-end database are all conducted in
the cloud (HDFS, MapReduce, Cloudbase).

(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT is hosted entirely on corporate services
and leverages FOSS technology (i.e. available to all NSA developers).
