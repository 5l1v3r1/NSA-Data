feditl Potentially Undesirable Images

We use face detection to try to censor material which may be
offensive but this does not work perfectly so you should read
the following before using OPTIC NERVE:

•	It is possible to handle and display undesirable images.
There is no perfect ability to censor material which may
be offensive. Users who may feel uncomfortable about
such material are advised not to open them.

•	You are reminded that under GCHQ's offensive material
policy, the dissemination of offensive material is a
disciplinary offence.

•	Retrieval of or reference to such material should be
avoided; see IB 150 for guidance on dealing with
offensive material
