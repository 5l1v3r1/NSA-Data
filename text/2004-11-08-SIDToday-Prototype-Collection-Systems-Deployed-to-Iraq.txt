DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S//SI) Prototype Collection Systems Deployed to Iraq<br>FROM: MAJ Eric Toler, USA<br>Ops Officer, Signals Survey &amp; Analysis (S3112)<br>Run Date: 11/08/2004<br><br>The story of how three prototype systems were deployed to the Baghdad area to stay ahead of<br>changing communications (S//SI)<br>(S//SI) Since the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq over a year and a half ago, there<br>has been a continuing proliferation of new communications technologies into the region, as well<br>as a morphing enemy of insurgents and foreign fighters. To keep pace with this technology<br>explosion, the Signals Survey and Analysis Division (S3112), in conjunction with the National<br>Reconnaissance Office (NRO), has deployed and installed three prototype signal discovery<br>systems (called SIGINT T-VO) in and around Baghdad.<br><br>(S//SI) SIGINT T-VO system installed inside the SIGINT site at Camp Falcon in southern<br>Baghdad<br><br>(S//SI) SIGINT collection site at Camp Falcon. (The taller antenna at center is the TV-O RF<br>antenna; the shorter one just to its left is the T-VO GPS antenna)<br>(S//SI) SIGINT T-VO is a high-capacity, wideband digital recording system that is remotely<br>controlled by the GRSOC* Signals Development Center (SDC). Each system continuously <br> spectrum utilizing four tunable receivers <br> and a 16 hour buffer, which allows analysts to retrieve archived data, save to semipermanent storage, conduct initial analysis, and exfiltrate data files remotely to the GRSOC.<br>(TS//SI) The primary purpose of the SIGINT T-VO is to do signal discovery in Baghdad -- to<br>search for new, unknown, or variant signals within the VHF/UHF spectrum. To date, this mission<br>has been successful. The GRSOC SDC, utilizing the T-VO, was the first element to collect and<br>report data on a new CDMA* cellular network used by the Iraqi government; has discovered and<br>resolved four new TDM* signals; and assisted NSA with the development of their system to<br>exploit the APCO-25 communications system used by Baghdad Police.<br><br>(S//SI) <br> (Technical Director for S3112) surveys the signal environment at Camp<br>Slayer in Baghdad. Several sites were surveyed to determine the most effective location for<br>SIGINT T-VO.<br><br>(S//SI) The dome atop 4 Heads Palace in central Baghdad (post-JDAM) with SIGINT T-VO RF<br>antenna protruding through the top.<br>(TS//SI) The secondary purpose of the T-VO is to do signal/target development. This mission is<br>still evolving, but the Signals Survey and Analysis Division remains very optimistic about its<br>potential, which includes the capability to geolocate signals of interest. GRSOC SDC is<br>continuing to refine its Concept of Operations (CONOP) to analyze the signals environment<br>surrounding particular events, such as improvised explosive device (IED) detonations,<br>mortar/rocket attacks, ambushes, etc. The SDC analysts pull recorded data from the T-VO to<br>determine what signals were active 10 minutes before and after these events in an attempt to<br><br> </p>identify the particular IED detonation signal itself (if applicable) or identify Anti-Iraqi Forces<br>(AIF) command and control communications. This analysis is shared directly with the<br>appropriate target offices at the GRSOC, as well as the 1st Cavalry Division's Analysis and<br>Control Element (ACE) in Baghdad.<br>(S//SI) The actual deployment of SIGINT T-VO was conducted in two phases, both in<br>conjunction with other NSA missions, including the Army Cryptologic Operations office and<br>MINUTEMAN (S33142). Phase One, conducted from 17 June-20 July 04, included the<br>deployment of one SIGINT T-VO system to Camp Prosperity (aka 4 Heads Palace) adjacent to<br>the Green Zone in central Baghdad. Phase Two, conducted from 24 August-5 October 04,<br>included the deployment of two more T-VO systems, one to Camp Falcon in southern Baghdad<br>and one to Camp Patriot in eastern Baghdad.<br><br>(S//SI) Soldiers from D/312th MI Battalion at Four Heads Palace in Baghdad.
