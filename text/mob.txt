(TS//SI//NF) On 29 August, FAIRVIEW started delivering Mobility
Business Records traffic into MAINWAY under the existing Business
Record (BR) FISA authorization. The intent of the Business Records
FISA program is to detect previously unknown terrorist threats in
the United States through the cell chaining of metadata. This new
metadata flow is associated with a cell phone provider and will
generate an estimated 1.1 billion cellular records a day in addition
to the 700M records delivered currently under the BR FISA. After
extensive dialogue with the consumers of the BR data, repeated
testing, a push to get this flow operational prior to the tenth
anniversary of 9/11, and extensive coordination with external
entitites via our OGC (to include: FBI, DOJ, ODNI, and FISC) NSA
received approval to initiate this dataflow on August 29, 2011.
Analysts have already reported seeing BR Cellular records in the
Counter Terrorism call-chaining database queries.
