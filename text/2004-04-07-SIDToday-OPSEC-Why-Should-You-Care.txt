If you think<br>OPSEC doesn't apply to you, consider the following scenario:<br>(U//FOUO) You're at a luncheon at a local restaurant to bid farewell to Sue, a co-worker who is<br>moving on to a new office. There are 15 people there, all agency employees from your<br>immediate team, plus Sue's spouse, an agency employee who works in another area.<br>(U//FOUO) Your boss gets up and starts talking about the great contributions Sue has made to<br>your efforts against international crime, and the wonderful working relationship she's had with<br>our sister agencies inside the beltway. He goes on to mention that she'll make a great Branch<br>Chief, and the people working Russia are lucky to get her. Sue gets up to thank specific<br>individuals present who have helped her succeed.<br>(U//FOUO) Sound familiar? Then you've witnessed (or perhaps participated in) a demonstration<br>of poor OPSEC. But who cares? Did anybody do any harm here? After all, we know what is<br>classified, and we would never divulge that in public, right? But have you ever stopped to<br>consider what your unclassified public discussions might be giving away? Take the scenario, for<br>instance. This is a scene that is played out monthly in the Fort Meade area. It's entirely possible<br>that nothing said during the speeches was classified, and everyone who attended works here, so<br>what's the big deal?<br>(U//FOUO) To understand the answer, you need to think like the adversary. That's really what<br>OPSEC is all about. What information do our adversaries care about, and what are we giving<br>away every day? Let's look at the scenario from an adversary perspective. Pretend you're the<br>bad guy sitting at the next table in the restaurant where the luncheon is being held. What did<br>you learn? Take a minute to think about what information you believe was shared, and then<br>compare that to the list below.<br>1.  The names and faces of team members. (Picked up either because of introductions to<br>Sue's husband, or just in casual conversation.)<br>2.  The fact that this team works on international crime issues. This shows not only that the<br>NSA is interested in this issue, it also shows the adversary who specifically knows about<br>this target.<br>3.  The most senior people on the team have been identified, specifically the boss who<br>praised Sue's efforts. It is also highly likely that the general hierarchy of the team can be<br>determined just by watching social interaction.<br>4.  The links between NSA and other agencies working crime issues.<br>5.  The skills necessary to work both the international crime and Russian targets, and any<br>parallels between them.<br>(U//FOUO) There are potentially many more correlations that can be drawn from this scenario,<br>but I think you get the point. So what can we do to reduce this risk? There are some simple<br>adjustments we can make that can help a great deal. No, I'm not going to suggest discontinuing<br>luncheons. But requesting a private room, or for tables to be set up away from other customers<br>for privacy purposes is a relatively easy way to make it much more difficult for an adversary to<br>gather information unobtrusively.<br>(U//FOUO) I hope that this has shown you that OPSEC does, in fact, apply to everyone.
