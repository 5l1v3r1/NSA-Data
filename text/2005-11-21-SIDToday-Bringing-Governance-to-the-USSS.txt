(U//FOUO) In an October SID today article , we introduced you to
 SERIES: 
the concept of Governance, which is changing the way that the
(U) Governance Topic-ofUSSS is doing business. We told you that Governance training was
the-Day
already underway and that it was critical to getting the word out.
But, we kept you in suspense ... what does that training entail?

(U//FOUO) In line with chain training, MG Quirk is holding four
Governance sessions with randomly selected junior personnel.
These sessions will allow MG Quirk to personally inform a sector of
the workforce on the importance and benefits of the Governance
framework. All four sessions will be broadcast via videoteleconference (VTC) to the entire USSS.
(U) Videos :
(U//FOUO) In addition, several videos are currently being produced
that will deliver the theory and processes of Governance to your
desktop. The first video is nearing completion and will be streamed
so that everyone can view it. Once the video is ready for prime
time, you will receive a "sid_all" message letting you know how to
access the video.
(U) Slides and Documentation :
(U//FOUO) If you are itching for more information on Governance,
there is a slew of it on the SID homepage . Just look under the
"Gearing up for Governance" section; you will find briefing slides
with supporting notes and documentation (some of it still in draft
format).
(U//FOUO) Remember, the SIGINT OPS Staff (S02O) and the
Communications Staff (S02C) are here to help answer any
questions that you may have on Governance training.
