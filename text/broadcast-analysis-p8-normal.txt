4 Contact Chaining Via Broadcast Events

Figure 1: Interconnected Broadcast Events (Renoir)

4.1	Bulk events were visualized in Renoir. Since there is no TDI present within

broadcast events, it is difficult to say how many events represent unique users.
There were two distinct behaviors exhibited by users of Internet radio stations.

Figure 1 shows the first type - a highly connected group of Internet radio stations
with listeners having multiple connections to different radio stations. Figure 2 shows
the second trend within the graph. Each radio station has a set of users who are not
observed connecting to any other type of Internet radio station.

This observation may be an artifact of the data collection process, which is on a
smaller scale than what the corporate architecture can provide. However it may
provide an insight into different types of user on the Internet, the technologically
savvy user who uses multiple streams of radio for entertainment or news, and a
user who knows what they want to listen to.
