Why UN Day?<br>Because 59 years after its founding, the UN continues to be front-page news -- and to receive<br>attention at the highest levels of the U.S. government -- as never before.<br>(U//FOUO) Indeed, although the U.S.-UN relationship has had significant ups and downs, the UN<br>remains an invaluable arm of U.S. foreign policy even while it faces some of the greatest<br>institutional challenges of its history: corruption scandals, a potentially massive reform effort,<br>and a rethinking of its modus operandi after the August 19, 2003 bombing of UN headquarters<br>in Baghdad. In short, it was never such an auspicious time to host a wide-ranging discussion on<br>"whither the UN?"<br>(S//SI) "UN Day" was graced by the presence of dozens of UN experts from across the policy<br>and intelligence worlds. Representatives of State, the U.S. Mission to the UN, the Pentagon, the<br>National Intelligence Council, CIA, and a wide range of NSA offices loaned their knowledge to the<br>proceedings. The day was split into three parts:<br>1.  morning plenary sessions, including an introduction by Deputy SIGINT Deputy Director<br>Charlie Meals, a keynote address by U.S. Representative to the UN for Management and<br>Reform Patrick Kennedy (in his second NSA appearance), an NSA Perspective by Deputy<br>International Security Issues Production Manager <br>, and a policy maker's view of<br>UN-related SIGINT by State/UN Political Affairs Director <br>;<br>2.  demonstrations of SIGINT production in the Russian Foreign Policy Branch; and<br>3.  breakout sessions on "UN Reform," "Peacekeeping in the 21st Century," "Inside the<br>Brains of the UN Security Council Permanent Representatives," "Changes to the UN<br>Psyche Since August 19, 2003," and "The UN General Assembly: U.S. Priorities and<br>Related Issues." The breakout sessions were facilitated not only by NSAers, but by<br>members of State, the CIA, and the NIC.<br>(U//FOUO) So what did we get out of UN Day? First and foremost it was profoundly useful to<br>have so many UN watchers, from such varied backgrounds, in the same room. Ambassador<br>Kennedy was an especially apt keynote speaker because of his hands-on experience with two of<br>the most crucial issues facing the UN (reform and the return to Iraq). However, the fact that he<br>was joined by so many participants giving freely of their time and expertise truly made the day a<br>success.<br>(S//SI) Secondly, however, UN Day was also excellent public relations for NSA: our analysts had<br>a chance to exhibit their UN expertise in the plenary and breakout sessions, while the<br>demonstrations in the Office of Russia showed our outside guests what a labor of time and skill<br>it is to produce the SIGINT reporting that they read and use every day. But just as importantly,<br>myriad NSAers worked diligently to ensure that our guests had a smoothly-running, edifying, and<br>enjoyable day. As <br> alluded to in her talk, it "takes a village" to produce UN-related<br>product for our UN-watching customers. It also "took a village" to make UN Day come off. Many<br>thanks to all!<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
