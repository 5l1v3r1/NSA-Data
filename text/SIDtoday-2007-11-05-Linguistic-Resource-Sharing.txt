(S//SI//REL) Linguistic Resource Sharing in Asia-Pacific Region Takes Step Forward
FROM: NSA Hawaii, Asia-Pacific CT Department (HS2I)

Unknown

Run Date: 11/05/2007

(S//SI//REL) Since 9111, NSA has been working to gain access to additional foreign language capability to
support the war on terrorism. These efforts have included attempts to share linguistic resources among
partner nations (see related article). This summer, a precedent was set with the first-ever voice-cut
exchange among a\\ members of SIGINT Seniors/Pacific:

(S//SI//REL) In order to explore the potential for sharing language capabilities, NSA/CSS Hawaii in June
of 2007 initiated the first successful voice cut exchange with SIGINT Seniors Pacific (SSPAC) members
by way of CRUSHED ICE. The voice cut was received and accessible by all members, and has set the
precedent for future exchanges of terrorist voice communications to take place. The ability to conduct
these exchanges has enhanced the linguistic resource pool available to SSPAC members to effect the
prosecution of terrorist communications in the Asia-Pacific region.

(S//SI//REL) What Is SIGINT Seniors/Pacific?

(S//SI//REL) Some background: In 2004, DIRNSA proposed that NSA take the lead in establishing a
collaborative effort to fight terrorism in the Asia-Pacific region, to be known as SIGINT Seniors Pacific
(SSPAC). The proposal came to fruition in January 2005 with Australia, Canada, South Korea, New
Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the UK all announcing their willingness tojoin forces with NSA in
order to share intelligence in a multilateral forum.

(S//SI//REL) CRUSHED ICE: The Way SSPAC Communicates

(S//SI//REL) In order to carry out these collaborative efforts, NSA developed CRUSHED ICE, a
data-sharing network for all SSPAC members to use at the analytic level (see related article). CRUSHED
ICE is a secure network that is capable of connecting all SSPAC members at the SECRET level to enable
exchange of CT-related information primarily derived from SIGINT. The system allows for collaboration
by way of voice, binary-file/email exchanges, analysis and reporting, graphics and mapping, communities
of interest, collection management, and other applications as needed.

CRUSHED

(S//SI//REL) SSPAC Members have also begun utilizing a new blog in CRUSHED ICE as yet another
form of increasing information sharing. This blog was created to further encourage exchanges that may
not be considered complete enough to issue a request for information (RFI), but still solicit member
participation.
