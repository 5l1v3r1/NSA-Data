for the death of several German soldiers over the past
year. This successful operation was a direct result of
SIGINT reporting by NSA Georgia (NSAG) on^^^^over
the previous eight months, as well as near real-time support during the operation
itself.

(U) Reporting Lays Groundwork

(S//SI//REL) As a result of NSAG's reporting, ^^^^vas placed on the Joint Priority
Effects List, or JPEL, on 10 April 2009. According to the Germans, besides being
responsible for the death of several German soldiers,	I ED attacks had led

to the gradual erosion of popular support for the Afghan government in general,
and specifically for the Afghan National Security Forces in the region (Badakhshan
Province in northern Afghanistan).

(S//SI//REL) Operation PITCH BLACK Gets the "Green Light"

(S//SI//REL) German forces, frustrated with IED attacks by this nemesis,
coordinated with Afghan Special Narcotics Forces (with British mentors) to action
the target, after receiving special permission from the German Minister of Defense.
(German forces rarely deploy from their bases in Afghanistan.) NSAG provided
pre-operation target packages and linguistic and analytic operational support prior
to and during the operation, working through the Interagency Operations
Coordination Center (IOCC).

(U) SIGINT Locates the Elusive Target

(S//SI//REL) At day break on 7 May, approximately 50 German troops and 15
Afghan soldiers arrived at^^^^^compound in the village of Bashun. German
HUMINT had cited this location as belonging to^^^| However, as a result of a
tip-off from a spotter nearby,was able to flee th^area. Over the next 5
hours, NSAG monitored communications related to^^^^ including those of
several narcotics traffickers linked to^^^Hand his insurgent activities.

Iwas passed from

(S//SI//REL) Near-real-time locational data on|

NSAG to the Germans via the Coalition's CENTER ICE system.* A
German SIGINTer then passed coordinates via radio communications
directly to the troops on the ground, within seconds of receiving the
information from NSAG. This locational data allowed the German
and Afghan troops to track and detain

despite a lack of

Predator/AIRHANDLER (tactical collection) coverage.

(S//SI//REL) Initial confirmation of	identity was made by the Germans via

photo identification, followed by IOCC confirmation of his cell phone, which was
seized at the time of his arrest. Afghan forces reported that	was in

possession of an AK-47 rifle when he was detained. ^^^|was then transported by
the Germans to Kabul, and subsequently turned over to the Afghans.

(S//SI//REL) The use of CENTER ICE was critical to the success of this operation. At
NSAG, CENTER ICE was manned by a Canadian integree within the Coalition
Support Cell. Of note, this was the first time that CENTER ICE has been used at
NSAG to support a live operation, in addition to the first time the Germans have
used CENTER ICE for coordination such as this. The Germans noted that our
support via CENTER ICE was "worth more than gold" and the "best they've ever
had."
