SIGINT reporting by NSA Georgia (NSAG) on-over
the previous eight months, as well as near real-time support during the operation
itself.

(U) Reporting Lays Groundwork

As a result of NSAG's reporting, -was placed on the Joint Priority
Effects List, or JPEL, on 10 April 2009. According to the Germans, besides being
responsible for the death of several German soldiers, -IED attacks had led
to the gradual erosion of popular support for the Afghan government in general,
and speci?cally for the Afghan National Security Forces in the region (Badakhshan
Province in northern Afghanistan).

Operation PITCH BLACK Gets the "Green Light"

German forces, frustrated with IED attacks by this nemesis,
coordinated with Afghan Special Narcotics Forces (with British mentors) to action
the target, after receiving special permission from the German Minister of Defense.
(German forces rarely deploy from their bases in Afghanistan.) NSAG provided
pre-operation target packages and linguistic and analytic operational support prior
to and during the operation, working through the Interagency Operations
Coordination Center (IOCC).

(U) SIGINT Locates the Elusive Target

Afghan soldiers arrived at -compound in the village of Bashun. German

and Afghan troops to track and detain - despite a lack of

The use of CENTER ICE was critical to the success of this operation. At
NSAG, CENTER ICE was manned by a Canadian integree within the Coalition
Support Cell. Of note, this was the ?rst time that CENTER ICE has been used at
NSAG to support a live operation, in addition to the ?rst time the Germans have
used CENTER ICE for coordination such as this. The Germans noted that our
support via CENTER ICE was "worth more than gold" and the "best they've ever
had."
