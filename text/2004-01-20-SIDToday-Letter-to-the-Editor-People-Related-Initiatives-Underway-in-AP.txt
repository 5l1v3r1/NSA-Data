Those are the groups<br>that appear to be struggling the most.<br>(U//FOUO) I have sent a Knowledge Transfer strategy to the Bubble [deputy directorate] COSs<br>for their input. My fear is that if we don't begin concentrating on a mechanism for ensuring<br>people are passing on what they know, even more critical mission knowledge will be lost than<br>we've experienced over the last decade. I'm hoping that some type of knowledge-sharing<br>activity can be embedded in the performance objectives of all employees, and make them very<br>specific. Some examples could include mentoring, OJT, internal networks, documenting<br>processes and lessons learned, updating webpages or learning portals, etc. I firmly believe that<br>everyone has something to contribute.<br>(U//FOUO) I would be more than happy to talk to any personnel who might be interested about<br>Knowledge Transfer and how some aspects can be accomplished even without investing a large<br>amount of money.<br>Respectfully,<br> S01P <br>Knowledge Transfer Strategist <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
