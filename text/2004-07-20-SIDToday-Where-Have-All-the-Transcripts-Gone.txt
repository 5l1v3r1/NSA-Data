If your answer is -- "What are<br>you talking about, they haven't gone anywhere, they are in my<br>SEMESTER," -- you'd better read on! SEMESTER is going away.<br>(U//FOUO) It's OK, you don't need to panic. All of those transcripts<br>can be moved into CREST , the new Agency historical transcript<br>repository. We won't even make you go through and hand-mark<br>each and every one of them for release (although it is tempting)!<br>Please contact the CREST team (go crest) to find out more about<br>the new system. SEMESTER PM <br> (<br>@nsa) can<br>work with you to automatically bulk release transcripts which have<br>never been released from your SEMESTER system.<br>(U//FOUO) Now, speaking of transcripts ... Do you know of any<br>transcripts out there that are in neither CREST (having been<br>moved from the ADB and AQUILINE) nor SEMESTER? Maybe<br>someone you know was transcribing in the comment field on the<br>hybrid (we are sure it wasn't you!). Or maybe someone has been<br>transcribing into flat files? If you know of any transcripts like this<br>we would appreciate it if you would contact the CREST team to<br>begin the process of getting those transcripts into the new system.<br>Our goal is to make CREST the one place to go to find transcripts,<br>and to do that we need to gather transcripts from wherever they<br>currently are.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Desktop<br>Modernization <br>1.
