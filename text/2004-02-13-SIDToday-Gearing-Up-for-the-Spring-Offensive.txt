Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 02/13/2004<br>FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA <br>Signals Intelligence Director <br>(S//SI) In the coming months, U.S. military and intelligence personnel will begin a Spring<br>Offensive in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area intended to locate and eliminate the al-Qa'ida<br>leadership. We in NSA have no higher priority than to support this Spring Offensive, and we<br>must be prepared.<br>(S//SI) As a result, today NSA will host a Rock Drill focused on this offensive. The Rock Drill will<br>bring together principal customers, key elements from NSA/HQ, and members of the Extended<br>Enterprise to review Intelligence Needs and to synchronize roles and responsibilities of the<br>organizations and people that will be directly involved.<br>(S//SI) The Rock Drill will pay particular attention to planning and our SIGINT "command and<br>control," so that we are set up to make decisions quickly and clearly. We will continue what we<br>are already doing in the Global War on Terrorism, while adding a few additional positions. The<br>details will be worked out after today's Rock Drill, at which time a SIGINT Operational Plan will<br>be finalized. That said, we have already determined the following:<br>1.  (S//SI) The MENA/South Asia Issue Management Team will be the lead IMT for the<br>Spring Offensive, with full support from the Counterterrorism IMT. The MENA/South Asia<br>IMT will reside in NSOC and, from there, lead a Spring Offensive Executive Steering<br>Team with SID and IA membership.<br>2.  (S//SI) Senior NSA representatives will be posted to Kabul/Bagram, Afghanistan and to<br>Islamabad, Pakistan to work with both CIA and CENTCOM personnel on issues related to<br>the Spring Offensive. Both representatives will report to the NCR CENTCOM. These<br>positions have been identified and will be named soon.<br>(S//SI) I understand that meeting the challenges of the Spring Offensive while maintaining<br>focus on other high-priority missions will not be easy. We must keep in mind that this effort may<br>not be a quick brute-force operation like Operation Iraqi Freedom's march to Baghdad -- it could<br>take eight days or eight months. We will be forced to make hard risk-management decisions<br>about the use of resources and take full advantage of operational opportunities as they arise.<br>(U//FOUO) I know I can count on all of you for your full support to these critical operations. Here<br>is a real opportunity to make a decisive and lasting contribution to our nation's security.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
