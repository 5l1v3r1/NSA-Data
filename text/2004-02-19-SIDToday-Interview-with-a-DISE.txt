DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Interview with a DISE<br>FROM: Jim Cusick<br>Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)<br>Run Date: 02/19/2004<br>FROM: Jim Cusick <br>Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3) <br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: As promised, here<br>is our interview with a member of the Defense Intelligence Senior<br>Executive Service. Thanks to Jim Cusick for answering our<br>questions!<br>(U) What do you consider the role of a DISE to be? How does it<br>differ from that of a GS employee or a DISL?<br>(U) I am going to guess that, if you asked every Defense<br>Intelligence Senior Executive (DISE) that question, there would be<br>no shortage of ideas of what that role is. You can get the pat<br>answer from the "competencies" which a DISES candidate and<br>DISE must exhibit to either enter or remain in the DISES, but my<br>name isn't Pat. From my perspective, the principle role of an NSA<br>"senior" is to think, plan, and act at the strategic level in order to<br>ensure that we are prepared to accomplish the mission, do indeed<br>accomplish it, and finally learn corporately from what we did.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA has a long and illustrious history of being able to<br>handle any crisis that comes to visit our nation or its allies. We<br>think and act tactically. Give us a crisis, a disaster, or a war, and<br>we focus like a laser on getting the job done. We don't much care<br>what sacrifices are involved. Accomplishing the mission is what we<br>live and breathe. It drives us. It nourishes us. It sustains us. I<br>know of no group of people on the planet that is more dedicated to<br>their mission or who can do it better. By the way, the mission is<br>preserving the safety and well being of our country and its<br>interests.<br>(U//FOUO) It is rarely something that even those with the most<br>Pollyanna-ish outlook on life would associate with fun. However,<br>someone has to devote their attention to ensuring that the national<br>treasure we all know as NSA can continue to avoid or shorten<br>conflict, give our policy makers and our military commanders the<br>decisive edge, and save lives. Someone needs to labor to ensure<br>that:<br>resources are available to work our miracles,<br>people with the right skills are here to do the job and are<br>properly nurtured,<br>the individuals and the organizations duly elected by our fellow<br>citizens know we are focused on the security of the nation and are<br>spending their very hard-earned tax dollars as wisely and as<br>effectively as possible, and<br>we appropriately collaborate with our partners to our mutual<br>advantage. <br>This unglamorous -- but critically necessary -- task falls in large<br>part to what we, affectionately or otherwise, refer to as seniors.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Senior Execs <br>1.  Senior Executive What Does It Mean?<br>2.  How Are Seniors<br>Selected and<br>Assigned?<br>3.  Seniors' Pay and<br>Benefits<br>4.  Interview with a<br>DISE<br><br> </p>What is the best part of being a DISE? ...the hardest part?<br>(U//FOUO) The best part of being a DISE is being privy to the<br>strategic picture and being positioned to influence operational and<br>personnel decisions at that level. For this former SOO, nothing is<br>more stimulating and fulfilling than current operations, but<br>prosecuting current operations doesn't happen by accident. In<br>order to enable those wonderful things done daily by the vast<br>majority of us, you need to know where the nation is going,<br>establish the goals and objectives to move you in that direction,<br>and ensure that the corporation has the resources to realize the<br>goals and objectives.<br>(U//FOUO) Like never before in NSA's history, the DISE population<br>is knowledgeable of exactly where the Director is leading us and<br>has ample opportunity to influence the actual implementation of<br>our corporate goals. Getting to know the future superstars in the<br>GG13 to GG15 range and working with them to help them to<br>realize the potential they already exhibit makes my day and<br>assures me that NSA will have superb leadership in the future. I<br>have mentoring relationships of varying degrees of formality and<br>informality with almost 20 great people. The time spent with them<br>is often hard to find, but it is one of the highlights of my career.<br>(U//FOUO) The hardest part is no longer being involved doing the<br>work that makes NSA a national treasure. I was hired as a linguist<br>and spent my first 25 years on the production side of the house<br>doing language, analysis and reporting related tasks. I then moved<br>over to the access and collection side of the equation and enjoyed<br>that tremendously as well. It was great fun and about as<br>intellectually rewarding as anyone has a right to expect. I miss the<br>rush of pulling together a report that is going to arm the President<br>with information to win the day for the nation. Now I am focused<br>on getting the resources so others can do that work and trying to<br>ensure an environment conducive to their success, professionally<br>and personally.<br>What are the "must have" talents a person needs to succeed as a<br>DISE?<br>(U) Any DISE worth his/her salt needs a sense of perspective, a<br>good sense of humor, a long memory for excellent interaction with<br>others and total amnesia regarding real or perceived wrongs, a<br>bias toward working as a member of a team, character above<br>reproach, complete candor and unimpeachable loyalty, a strong<br>desire to get involved with and nurture the people around him/her,<br>a preference for managing rather than avoiding risks, patience,<br>and a paucity of the "vertical pronoun" (I) in his/her vocabulary.<br>What advice would you give to someone who would like to<br>become a DISE? What training/experience should that person seek<br>out?<br>(U) Have a long discussion with your spouse, family, significant<br>other, yourself. Make absolutely certain you both/all agree that you<br>can live with potentially long hours, a good deal of real and selfimposed pressure, occasional missed family events and meals, and<br>remember that a healthy, functional family is probably the most<br>important factor in your professional success and your mental and<br>physical health.<br>(U) If you are of one accord on that front, find a mentor who<br>shares your values and believes in you. Let providence take you<br>where it will. If you never get elevated, you still know your family<br><br> </p>loves you, you live in the greatest nation on the globe, you are<br>making a difference for your fellow Americans and those you love,<br>you undoubtedly have a job twice as interesting as anyone outside<br>the IC, you are well paid, you are eating regularly, you have never<br>slept on a grate.... You get the picture. Your value as a tremendous<br>asset to your country, your family and your Agency will never<br>hinge upon elevation. God bless America!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
