We<br>asked Deborah Maklowski to describe a memorable incident from her career...<br>(S//SI) The one that comes to mind occurred in the mid-80's, when I was working Polish Military<br>Trade &amp; Aid, and President Reagan was trying hard to convince a reluctant Congress to fund the<br>Contras in Nicaragua.<br>(S//SI) I'd been following a deal in the making between Cenzin, the Polish government entity<br>that handled foreign military sales, and the pro-Soviet Sandinista government of Nicaragua for a<br>(one) helicopter (the Sandinistas were NOT big spenders). Poland manufactured and sold a lot<br>of helicopters, mostly for crop-dusting, and I didn't track those sales, but when I got the specs<br>on this one and saw that it would be equipped with rocket launchers, I put out a report.<br>(S//SI) When I got back into the office the morning after the report was released, my branch<br>chief asked me how much money I'd gotten for my Washington Post article: he then showed me<br>my SIGINT report reproduced as an article in the Post. The only change to the text I'd written<br>and released was the lack of classification. My guess is that the White House, which was looking<br>for anything that would help make a case with Congress for support for the Contras, just<br>unilaterally decided to release the SIGINT to the press, without asking and without sanitization,<br>as yet one more piece of evidence of Soviet (well, sort of) support for the Sandinistas.<br>(S//SI) Twenty-some years later, I have to admit that my outrage at having a fragile SIGINT<br>source put at risk so cavalierly was tempered by a guilty sense of pride that the Post had not<br>seen fit to edit my text at all!<br>A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br>How a Four Star General Once Waited for a Lowly Captain to Finish Eating Lunch<br>In SHAPE, In France<br>"Soviet Rocket" Strikes Chicksands<br>Onboard Air Force 2 Bound for Moscow<br>Testifying Before Congress...
