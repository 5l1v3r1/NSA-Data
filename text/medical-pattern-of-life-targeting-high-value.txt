(C//REL) Medical
Intelligence

•	(C//REL) What is Medical Intelligence?

•	(S//SI//REL) Methodology used for Extracting Medical
Pattern of Life (PoL) from Medical Intelligence.

•	(TS//SI//REL) Medical PoL ^ Identification of all
recurring, and therefore predictable, patterns of
behavior that constitute the specific treatment
regimen for a target’s medical illness

• Medications, Medical Tests, Medical Surgical
Treatments, Hospital and Doctor Visits

(S//REL) High Value
Individual Targeting

•	(TS//SI//REL) Advantages of Medical Intel:

•	Credible Medical Intel Never Goes Stale

•	Tagging and tracking medications/supplies to a
specific target enables us to leap over the non-
electronic moat with which HVI’s surround
themselves, enabling their geolocation.

•	Enables Geolocation in Cities or Countryside.

•	(S//REL) Case Examples of the use of Medical

PoL for GeoLocation Targets.
