DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S//SI) SID Support to SOUTHCOM - Update on U.S. Hostages<br>FROM:<br>SOUTHCOM Account Manager (S112)<br>Run Date: 02/23/2004<br>FROM: <br>SOUTHCOM Account Manager (S112) <br>(S//SI) February 13th marked the one-year anniversary for three Americans being held hostage<br>by insurgents in Colombia. Hundreds of personnel across the Defense, Intelligence, Policy, and<br>Law Enforcement Communities have been working to gain their release. The challenge is great,<br>the risks are tremendous, and the outlook is uncertain. Still, the SIGINT system has been<br>focused on providing actionable intelligence on this top SOUTHCOM priority.<br> <br>SRS crash <br>(TS//SI) Last year, a SOUTHCOM Reconnaissance System Cessna crashed while performing a<br>counternarcoterrorism mission over the coca fields of Caqueta, Colombia. The plane was<br>immediately surrounded by FARC (Revolutionary Armed forces of Colombia) insurgents who<br>executed Thomas Janis (U.S. pilot) and Luis Alcides Cruz (Colombian). The FARC then took the<br>remaining three U.S. crewmembers hostage - Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howe, and Keith<br>Stansell.<br> <br> <br> <br>Marc Gonsalves  Thomas Howes  Keith Stansell <br>(TS//SI) There has been a steady stream of intelligence reports about the location and status of<br>the hostages from the moment they were captured, and even specials on 60 Minutes II and the<br>History Channel last summer showing an interview with the hostages. However, the U.S. has not<br>been able to determine with high confidence the exact location and status of the hostages. This<br>is the goal for the SIGINT system.<br>(TS//SI) Many elements of the SIGINT system are monitoring related communications.<br>Immediately after the crash, airborne platforms intercepted calls from FARC members discussing<br>the movement of the hostages. NSA also monitored INMARSAT communications associated with<br>high-level FARC commanders. However, the FARC leadership soon thereafter ordered that<br>personnel cease mentioning hostage operations directly. Still, through call chaining work<br>performed at USM-1 in Ft Belvoir, and elsewhere, NSA has been monitoring the INMARSAT calls<br>of two radio operators, Paula and Adriana, who are connected to two FARC leaders we strongly<br>suspect are linked to the hostages. Mapping of INMARSAT, and all other communications in the<br>target areas, has been performed daily by elements in Regional Targets, International Crime and<br>Narcotics, Medina RSOC, Denver Field Station, and CSG SOUTHCOM. The Joint Interagency Task<br>Force-SOUTH Cryptologic Support Group has been coordinating various airborne missions<br>collecting, among other technologies, High Powered Cordless Phones, associated with the FARC.<br>(TS//SI) SIGINT has shown the FARC visually tracking airborne platforms as they fly over<br>suspected hostage locations, resulting in FARC stations observing radio silence to avoid<br>detection. The Special Collection Service has been monitoring communications that link various<br>locations where the hostages have been moved. Regional Targets SIGDEV personnel routinely<br>work with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, with cross-cueing between both agencies<br>resulting in discoveries of new FARC communications networks and activity in suspect areas. The<br>Cryptologic Support Group at SOUTHCOM was recently made a part of the SIGINT Production<br>Chain, and has provided valuable analysis for USSOUTHCOM leadership.<br>(S//SI) Locating, tracking, and gaining the release of the hostages requires teaming across the<br>U.S government. NSA is engaged in sensitive, ongoing, focused operations. Every effort is being<br><br> </p>made by NSA to enable SOUTHCOM to create a positive outcome.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
