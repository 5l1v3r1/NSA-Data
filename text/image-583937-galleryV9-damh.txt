OLYMPUSFIRE

OLYMPUSFIRE is an exploitation system that uses a software implant on a
Microsoft Windows based target PC to gain complete access to the targeted PC. The
target, when connected to the Internet, will contact a Listening Post (LP) located at an
NSA/USSS facilities, which is online 24/7, and get its commands automatically.
These commands include directory listings, retrieving files, performing netmaps, etc.
The results of the commands are then returned to the LP, where the data is collected
and forwarded to CES and analysis and production elements.
