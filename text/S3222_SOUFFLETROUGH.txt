(TS//SI//REL) SOUFFLETROUGH Persistence Implant Concept of Operations

(TS//SI//REL) SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper SSG
500 and SSG 300 series firewalls {320M, 350M, 520, 550, 520M, 550M}. It persists
DNT’s BANANAGLEE software implant and modifies the Juniper firewall’s operating
system (ScreenOS) at boot time. If BANANAGLEE support is not available for the
booting operating system, it can install a Persistent Backdoor (PBD) designed to
work with BANANAGLEE’s communications structure, so that full access can be
reacquired at a later time. It takes advantage of Intel’s System Management Mode
for enhanced reliability and covertness. The PBD is also able to beacon home, and
is fully configurable.

(TS//SI//REL) A typical SOUFFLETROUGH deployment on a target firewall with an
exfiltration path to the Remote Operations Center (ROC) is shown above.
SOUFFLETROUGH is remotely upgradeable and is also remotely installable
provided BANANAGLEE is already on the firewall of interest.

Status: (C//REL) Released. Has been deployed. There are no
availability restrictions preventing ongoing deployments.
