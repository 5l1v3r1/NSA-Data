DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Ask Raul: Fonts and Encoding (repost)<br>FROM: 'Raul', a DNI Analyst<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 08/13/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the first of a monthly series of articles on<br>DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) matters by guest columnist Raul:<br>(U) Hey, Raul! What's the difference between a font and a character set encoding? Aren't<br>they the same?<br>(U) Argh!!! If there is one thing that will drive old Raul crazy it is hearing people -- people who<br>have been through endless NSA C2C/DNI courses -- referring to an encoding as a font or vice<br>versa. So, in order to help keep my blood pressure down, here's how it works:<br>(U) A font is simply a collection of symbols (glyphs) of a particular style and size. Fonts have<br>names which may or may not be of any use in figuring out what they cover. For example:<br>Times, Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman Cyrillic, Ivan's Crazy Cyrillic, etc.<br>For a given language or glyph set, the different fonts are simply different styles of the same<br>thing.<br>For example, here are the letters 'ABCDEF' in several different fonts:<br> <br>(U) In this case there isn't much difference to the eye between Helvetica and Times but<br>AvantGarde and Courier are obviously different from one another and the last two.<br>(U) Computers use fonts as the means to allow them to display things, whether that be on a<br>monitor or printer, to a human being. At the core though, the computer simply sees things as<br>numbers. To give you an idea, here is an entire font, Lucida Sans Typewriter:<br> <br>(U) In this case, the font name, which is listed at the top of this image, tells us the encoding<br>this font uses is ISO8859-1. This standard says that certain glyphs will be encoded with specific<br>values. Here, 'A', regardless of how fancy it might be, will always be represented by the number<br>0x41 (decimal 65), 'B' will be 0x42 (66), 'a' will be 0x61 (97), etc.<br>(U) An encoding is simply a method of representing one thing with something else. In this case<br>it is glyphs with numbers. In a file, on a computer using ISO8859-1 encoding, the phrase, <br>"The big black bird"<br>is actually stored as: <br>0x540x680x650x200x620x690x670x200x620x6c0x610x630x6b0x200x620x690x720x640x2e<br>It is only when we send this to a display device that it gets transformed, via a font, into:<br>The big black bird<br>(U) Every foreign language is covered by a multitude of encodings. Some are international<br>standards while others are completely home grown.<br>(U) In some cases, an encoding will use a single 7 or 8-bit value to represent a single glyph. In<br>others, 16, 24, or even 32 bits can be used. For example, here are a few of the encodings that<br><br> </p>cover the Cyrillic letter 'A':<br>Glyph<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br><br>Encoding<br>ISO8859-5<br>KOI-8<br>CP1251<br>JAVA<br>UCS-2LE<br>UCS-2BE<br>UTF-8<br><br>Value<br>0xb0<br>0xf1<br>0xd0<br>\u0410<br>0x100x04<br>0x040x10<br>0xd00x90<br><br>(U) As you can readily see, if you go looking for something and don't allow for the encoding, you<br>are not likely to find what you want.<br>(U) So, do Raul a favor and keep your fonts and encodings straight.<br>(U) If you have a DNI-related question for Raul, please use the "comments/suggestions"<br>function at the bottom of this page to pose it. We will make sure Raul gets it.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
