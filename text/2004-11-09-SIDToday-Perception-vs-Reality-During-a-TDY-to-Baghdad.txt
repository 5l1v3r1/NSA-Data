In<br>today's article, he discusses NSA's interaction with the customers and describes the situation on<br>the ground. (S//SI)<br>(S//SI) One of the most fascinating discoveries you'll make during a deployment to Iraq (in<br>addition to a new multiplexed communications signal) is discovering the difference between<br>perception and reality. During my first visit to Iraq, the perception by the 1st Cavalry Division<br>was that NSA was more of a hindrance than a provider. However, during my last visit that<br>perception was mostly changed, due in large part to the implementation of the Cryptologic<br>Support Team (CST) at the Division level.<br><br>(S//SI) Traffic control -- M1A1 style. View from the top of the SIGINT collection site at Camp<br>Patriot in eastern Baghdad. Elements from the 1st Brigade Combat Team (1st Cavalry Division)<br>are enroute to support a major offensive operation in Sadr City.<br>(S//SI) The CST, comprised of NSA service members, alleviates much of the previous frustration<br>by giving the 1st Cavalry Division a single point of contact for all NSA issues, literally at arms<br>reach. Additionally, we at NSA must remember that every person we send forward is a<br>representative of the entire agency, and perceptions are formed based on each person's<br>performance -- either good or bad.<br>(S//SI) Another perception that changes when you deploy is that of what is actually happening<br>in Iraq. There is a huge difference between seeing the aftermath of a Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED)<br>on CNN and feeling the concussion of that VBIED in your own chest, talking to the soldiers that<br>were wounded in action, and attending a memorial service for a soldier that bravely gave his life<br>for his comrades. Iraq is still a very dangerous place where our brothers and sisters in arms are<br>making the ultimate sacrifice on a daily basis; but the sense of hopelessness that we sometimes<br>sense from the news media is not there.<br>(S//SI) Our service members in Iraq are motivated, they believe in their mission, they<br>understand its importance, and they know they will come out victorious. When you meet and get<br>to know the soldiers you are supporting it increases your sense of urgency. Not your urgency to<br>see who can be the first one out of the parking lot at 1530, but your urgency to figure out what<br>else you can do that might save a life.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on CSTs, see the article Supporting the Tactical Units .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"></p>
