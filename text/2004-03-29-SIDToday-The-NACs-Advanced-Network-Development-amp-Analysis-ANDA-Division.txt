Today we'd like to profile one of<br>the NAC's three divisions, namely the Advanced Network<br>Development and Analysis (ANDA) Division.<br>(TS//SI) The ANDA Division brings together people with a range of<br>skills -- Collection Managers, Computer Scientists, Engineers,<br>Intelligence Analysts, Network Engineers and Mathematicians -- all<br>performing Network Analysis in order to isolate and access targets<br>within the worldwide digital network. In doing so, we use a variety<br>of data sources, including open source data and SIGINT<br>information such as routing protocol data. As worldwide network<br>use has exploded, becoming the communications of choice for<br>many targets, ANDA is called upon from various elements within<br>both the Analysis and Production and Data Acquisition Directorates<br>to assist with both tactical and strategic Network Analysis needs.<br>(TS//SI) Our work has shown concrete results. For example, ANDA<br>played an instrumental part during the January 2004 apprehension<br>of a key Al Qaida operative within Iraq - namely Husam al-Yemeni,<br>aka Firas. We've assisted the Office of Regional Targets with<br>developing a more complete understanding of the Pakistani Army<br>Defense Network (ADN) infrastructure. We've also assisted this<br>same office with the development of an important digital network<br>associated with Venezuelan's leader, Victor Chavez. Regularly we<br>assist the Office of Counterterrorism with the daily tracking of<br>several key targets as they move throughout the worldwide digital<br>network.<br>(TS//SI) Besides dealing with current operations, ANDA tries to<br>foresee the future needs of the Directorate. For example, we have<br>anticipatory development efforts underway in preparation for the<br>2004 Olympics. We're also spearheading efforts to conduct<br>Network Analysis against special source data on the<br>Counterterrorism target, as well as future needs of the upcoming<br>2004 Spring Offensive.<br>(TS//SI) But we're not done yet! ANDA also realizes the<br>importance of not only tracking targets within the worldwide web,<br>but also keeping abreast of the network technologies used by those<br>targets. To that end, ANDA currently holds chairmanship of both<br>the Agency's Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Wireless DNI<br>working groups. Additionally, our Routing Protocols Working Group<br>is working to define smart ways to infuse routing/routed protocol<br>analysis into our mainstream Network Analysis methods.<br>(S//SI) For more information on ANDA, please see our webpage by<br>typing "go anda".<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SIGINT Development <br>1.
