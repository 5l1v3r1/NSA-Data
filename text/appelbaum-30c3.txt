To Protect And Infect

The Militarization of the Internet
(Part Two; in three acts)

The 30c3 - December 30th, 2013

Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror)

Act I

(Low end) corporate spying

•	Commercial hardware solutions are rather boring

•	Forensics hardware like the "Mouse Jiggler"

-	Now disabled in systemd (!)

•	Power insertion attacks

-	Hotplug seizures

•	Keystroke recorders

-	largely lame

•	FinFisher, HackingTeam, VUPEN

Rafael is a journalist
from Angola, who
exposed corruption
in the government.

Angola Attack

•	Discovered at Oslo Freedom Forum

•	Lamest OS X backdoor ever

-	Screencapture

-	Curl

-	Sleep

•	Unsuspecting 8 GB of screenshots in the home directory

•	Infrastructure connected with Operation Hangover

-	Appin Security

•	Code signed

-	Apple revoked the signing permissions in a reasonable time frame

In Summer 2013 Rafael was arrested, then
released and faced 11 criminal charges for his
work exposing corruption.

These guys aren’t impressive

They do harm to good people and they hand
wave away their contribution to increasing the
total amount of human suffering in the world.

Act II

Intelligence agency "solutions"

Meta-point: "non-attributable to NSA"
Meta-point: Total surveillance & control in secrecy

The Big Picture

•	Planetary Strategic Surveillance and...

•	Exploitation Systems

•	Passive sensors

•	Collect (TURMOIL)

•	Active attacks

•	Infect (TURBINE, QFIRE, etc)

•	Wait, what about "Protect?!"

•	Multi-pwn!

•	Blackhats used to keep your box updated
•... these guys step on each other's toes

•	Operations - “Close Access Operations“ and “Off-Net”

(TS//SI//REL) NIGHTSTAND - Close Access Operations •
Battlefield Tested • Windows Exploitation • Standalone System

System Details

>	(U//FOUO) Standalone tool currently
running on an x86 laptop loaded with
Linux Fedora Core 3.

>	(TS//SI//REL) Exploitable Targets
include Win2k, WinXP, WinXPSPl,

WINXPSP2 running internet Explorer
versions 5.0-6.0.

>	(TS//SI//REL) NS packet injection can
target one client or multiple targets on a
wireless network.

>	(TS//SI//F£iSÎj^fë(^^indetecta6lé by
the user.

NIGHTSTAND Hardware

(TS//SI//REL) Use of external amplifiers and antennas in both
experimental and operational scenarios have resulted in successful
NIGHTSTAND attacks from as far away as eight miles under ideal
environmental conditions.

How do "they" do it?

•	Dragnet surveillance

•	Data retention

•	~15 years at least, including content!

•	Tasking, exploitation

•	QUANTUM THEORY and how each "solution"
tries to meet this goal

•	Man-On-The-Side as QUANTUM INSERTION

•	PRISM, “upstream” and many other programs

“They’ll never find me!”

Dream on - Data Retention is an important part of
total surveillance and the analysis is successful

against us all.

Data totalitarianism or put another way:

totalitarianism

TURMOIL

Deep Packet Inspection
(Passive dragnet surveillance sensors)

TURBINE

Deep Packet Injection

QFIRE

TURMOIL and TURBINE combined with
additional infrastructure that they co-opt through
pwnage of routers and other operations.

From wiretapping to whole life surveillance

Example one: German Chancellor Merkel!
(We revealed this operation in Der Spiegel)

Example two: Political and religious 'untasked'
targeting for some set of websites

Example three: three hops away? Uh oh!

(That's you!)

This is the militarization of the internet

•	We are under a kind of martial law

•	This strategy is undermining the internet in a
direct attempt to keep it insecure

•	We are personally and socially left vulnerable
and actively exploited, literally

•	This is being done in our names with our tax
money and without our consent; usually without
the knowledge of our representatives!

•	Those who know usually do not actually
understand! (eg: Members of the US Congress)

Active exploitation of targets with FOXACID

Selector surveillance leads to exploitation:

•	QUANTUMTHEORY

•	SEASONEDMOTH (SMOTH)

•	QUANTUMNATION

•	VALIDATOR, COMMONDEER

•	QUANTUMBOT

•	QUANTUMCOPPER

•	Think “The Great Firewall of China”

•	Ahem, “The Great Firewall of Earth”

•	QUANTUMINSERT

•	Think Man-on-the-side

TAO infrastructure

•	First they find the target, then they redirect them

•	QUANTUMINSERT and FOXACID

•	Server’s like to pretend that they’re Apache
servers

•	Implemented in Python, easily fingerprinted

•	A few FOXACID URLs are public

•	Pay attention to the bugs in their
implementation

(TS//SI//REL) SOMBERKNAVE is a software implant that surreptitiously routes
TCP traffic from a designated process to a secondary network via an unused
embedded 802.11 network device. If an Internet-connected wireless Access
Point is present, SOMBERKNAVE can be used to allow OLYMPUS or
VALIDATOR to “call home” via 802.11 from an air-gapped target computer. If
the 802.11 interface is in use by the target, SOMBERKNAVE will not attempt
to transmit.

(TS//SI//REL) Operationally, VALIDATOR initiates a call home.
SOMBERKNAVE triggers from the named event and tries to associate with an
access point. If connection is successful, data is sent over 802.11 to the ROC.
VALIDATOR receives instructions, downloads OLYMPUS, then disassociates
and gives up control of the 802.11 hardware. OLYMPUS will then be able to
communicate with the ROC via SOMBERKNAVE, as long as there is an
available access point.

utilizes modular mission applications to provide specific SIGINT functionality. This
functionality includes the ability to remotely push/pull files from the device, SMS
retrieval, contact list retrieval, voicemail, geolocation, hot mic, camera capture, cell
tower location, etc. Command, control, and data exfiltration can occur over SMS
messaging or a GPRS data connection. All communications with the implant will be
covert and encrypted.

(TS//SI//REL) Modern SIM cards (Phase 2+) have an application program interface
known as the SI Ml Toolkit (STK). The STK has a suite of proactive commands that
allow the SIM card to issue commands and make requests to the handset.
MONKEYCALENDAR uses STK commands to retrieve location information and to
exfiltrate data via SMS. After the MONKEYCALENDAR file is compiled, the
program is loaded onto the SIM card using either a Universal Serial Bus (USB)
smartcard reader or via over-the-air provisioning. In both cases, keys to the card
may be required to install the application depending on the service provider's
security configuration

that otherwise would not be collectable, or would be extremely difficult to collect
and process. It provides the following features:

•	Frequency Range: 1 - 2 GHz.

•	Bandwidth: Up to 45 MHz

•	Output Power: User adjustable up to 2 W using the internal amplifier; external
amplifiers make it possible to go up to 1 kW.

•	Phase adjustment with front panel knob

(U) Capabilities

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) RAGEMASTER provides a target for RF flooding
and allows for easier collection of the VAGRANT video signal. The current
RAGEMASTER unit taps the red video line on the VGA cable. It was found that,
empirically, this provides the best video return and cleanest readout of the
monitor contents.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) The RAGEMASTER taps the red video line
between the video card within the desktop unit and the computer monitor,
typically an LCD. When the RAGEMASTER isjllun^nated.byL& radaruaiOhe
illuminating signal is modulated with the red viaemnTormSi^W^^Mmation
is re-radiated, where it is picked up at the radar, demodulated, and passed
onto the processing unit, such as a LFS-2 and an external monitor,
NIGHTWATCH, GOTHAM, or (in the future) VIEWPLATE. The processor
recreates the horizontal and vertical sync of the targeted monitor, thus allowing
TAO personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) NIGHTWATCH is a portable computer with
specialized, internal hardware designed to process progressive-scan (non-
interlaced) VAGRANT signals.

(U) Capability Summary

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The current
implementation of NIGHTWATCH consists of
a general-purpose PC inside of a shielded
case. The PC has PCI digitizing and clock
cards to provide the needed interface and
accurate clocking required for video
reconstruction. It also has:

•	horizontal sync, vertical sync and video
outputs to drive an external, multi-sync
monitor.

•	video input

•	spectral analysis up to 150 kHz to provide for indications of horizontal and
vertical sync frequencies

•	frame capture and forwarding

•	PCMCIA cards for program and data storage

•	horizontal sync locking to keep the display set on the NIGHTWATCH display.

•	frame averaging up to 2A16 (65536) frames.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) Data RF retro-reflector. Provides return
modulated with target data (keyboard, low data rate digital device) when
illuminated with radar.

U) Capabilities

TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) SURLYSPAWN
as the capability to gather keystrokes without
equiring any software running on the targeted
ystem. It also only requires that the targeted
ystem be touched once. The retro-reflector is
ompatible with both USB and PS/2 keyboards,
he simplicity of the des^n^tmws the form
actor to be tailored for specific operational
equirements. Future capabilities will include
aptop keybo;

U) Concept of Operation

TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The board taps into the data line from the
eyboard to the processor. The board generates a square wave oscillating at
preset frequency. The data-line signal is used to shift the square wave
requency higher or lower, depending on the level of the data-line signal. The
quare wave, in essence, becomes frequency shift keyed (FSK). When the
nit is illuminated by a CW signal from a nearby radar, the illuminating signal
s amplitude-modulated (AM) with this square wave. The signal is re-radiated,
here it is received by the radar, demodulated, and the demodulated signal is
rocessed to recover the keystrokes. SURLYSPAWN is part of the
NGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar retro-reflectors.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) Beacon RF retro-reflector. Provides return
when illuminated with radar to provide rough positional location.

(U) Capabilities

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) TAWDRYYARD is
used as a beacon, typically to assist in locating
and identifying deployed RAGEMASTER units.
Current design allows it to be detected and located
quite easily within a 50' radius of the radar system
being usej^y&iNUBiMe it. TAWDRYYARD draws
as 8 pA at 2.5V (20pW) allowing a standard lithiu^
coin cell to power it for months or years. The
^^l^^fthe design allows the form factor to
be tailored for specific operational requirements.
Future capabilities being considered are return of
GPS coordinates and a unique target identifier and
automatic processing to scan a target area for
presence of TAWDRYYARDs. All components are
COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The board generates a square wave operating
at a preset frequency. This square wave is used to turn a FET (field effect
transistor) on and off. When the unit is illuminated with a CW signal, the
illuminating signal is amplitude-modulated (AM) with the square wave. This
