Risk Management for SIGINT
Threats (U)

Threat to SIGINT Capability

A behavior or technology that has the potential to have a negative
impact on capability to provide SIGINT on a Terrorism Target

(U) Use Risk
The possibility that a particular threat will be adopted by Terrorist targets
Indications and Warning

Early warning of high impact threats to prevent surprise to key
stakeholders and reduce risk from Terrorist adoption of technology that
would adversely affect SIGINT production

The data-driven approach
(U)

"Count what is countable, measure what is measurable, and make measurable that
which cannot be measured?

Galileo (1 7th century astronomer)

"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot
express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind"

Lord Kelvin (discovered absolute zero)

cannot manage what you cannot measure?
Bill Hewlett (co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)

"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted
counts"

- Albert Einstein

Optic Emerging Technology
Discovery (U)

Emerging Technology Behavior Discovery

Detection of interest, experimentation, knowledge transfer or direction using
content, metrics approaches

Currently using deskside virtual engagement to leverage TOPI analyst
initiative to discover, prioritize, and work against "strongest" indicators

Leverages inherent TOPI expertise and functions of traffic processing/translation/tasking
etc..

Embedded virtual relationships: production ?customers?
Currently identifying, tracking ?technical? thought leaders
Technical sub-forums, scanning notes measurements

Administrative emails (No-Reply etc..)

Forum links, uploaded/downloaded files

Goal: Generate Prioritized Input (techs/behaviors) for Research

Optic Technology Use
Discovery (U)

Technology Use and Behavior Discovery

?Stratactical? data sets
Includes target-specific data point for each item selector)

Discovery of target behavior by identifying technology use patterns, trends, and/or
anomalies in:

User-agents (browsers, OS, devices)

Tasking (new tasking, total tasking)

Network, Protocol usage (Active User metrics)

Visited URLs, web searches

Process lists, pre-fetch logs, registry entries, software logs

Hardware usage (smartphones, tablets, SD cards)

Currently using various tools (XKEYSCORE, SEEKER, BIONICTURTLE, JEMA, JOLLYROGER,
MARINA, TUNINGFORK, QFDs, and approaches with multiple cloud analytics in
varying stages of development and/or planning

Goal: Generate Prioritized Input (techs/behaviors) for Research

The Wicked Problem Aspect (U)

Defining the problem is the first (wicked)
problem
Triage Stage 1
Initial priority: (single) target initial understanding of technology

Implications Research

- What does the product/service do?

Current NSA capabilities to detect, collect, exploit, analyze?
Do any other CT targets use it?

Triage Stage 2
Updated priority: target(s) updated understanding of 
Validated Next Steps

As needed: capabilities/access development requirements

Reporting: internal, CIR, e-gram; Gaps report; prioritization w/in tech category

 


Goal: Periodic Reporting

Vehicle (U)

. Move beyond ad hoc task responses to routine deliverables

. Overcoming volume challenge
Huge variety of inputs, massive numbers in each
Prioritization

Visualization

. Moving threats to a simple Risk Assessment model

Borrows methodology from models used for executive purposes elsewhere in agency
(FAMT, Geopolitical Technology Trends Matrix, 
Opportunities, threats handled separately

 

 

Capability Development
ChaHenges(U)

With rare exceptions,
application-specific solutions are only
built based on these two 

. In resource-restrained environment, development of capabilities against likely-
to-increase in priority applications is trumped by standing requirements
driven by known priority applications

. Capabilities development response to current/priority technology threats occurs
normally w/in existing resources but response does not scale, either to the
industry or to multiple crises

 


Goal: Emerging Technology

Snapshot(U)

- (U) Executive version snapshot of top items only

- Overcoming the challenges of prioritization and volume
is still only 50% of the problem

- Stated Preference:
Breakdowns by target/target set
Preserve opportunity vs. threat

Identify HUMINT sources for collaboration

Getting Data is Step 1 (U)

 


Getting Data is Step 1 (U)

 


Visualization (U)

Excel tops out at a million 

19 branches, 30+ target sets, ~200 realms, ~800 domains, ~45000
selectors 1 million rows/~25 weeks for summarized active user events
from E012333 alone

Spreadsheets are good, but not everyone knows how to use a
pivot table

Each dataset can easily provide 4-5 or more pivoted looks for
each branch/target set minimum 100-150 slides

 


Visualization (U)

work at the selector level

Leadership wants data presented at the target level

Automated population of technology, behavior
information in analyst workflow tools, databases

Each separate visualization task takes
manpower, time away from operational analysis

 


Clean Data (U)

Metrics will only provide a near-accurate picture: ground truth will always be the domain of
the TOPI and based on content

Some selectors (accurately) map to multiple targets, multiple teams, multiple organizations
Some selectors simply don?t have a known target, only a target set

Need to correlate across widely different datasets requires creation of normalized bridge
datasets comparing executables to domains)

are victims of years of "fill in the blank" freeform data entry; very slowly being
addressed (~2015?)

 


Rising Strategic Issues (U)

- Webmail Services
Atabmail, Zoho, Safe-mail, Fastmail, HMA Mail

- Remote Desktop Viewers/Remote Access Tools

TeamViewer, Join.me, Cybergate

- Messaging Services
WhatsApp, Nimbuzz, eBuddy

 


What Next? (U)

Continue to build, strengthen, expand:

internal workflows, research and discovery capabilities

collaboration with production elements

Operational support via embedded at NSAW
Tradecraft, technical support virtually with extended enterprise

partnerships with FVEY SIGDEV community

Establish and expand dialogue opportunities
"Failure Sharing" tradecraft sharing and operational deconfliction
