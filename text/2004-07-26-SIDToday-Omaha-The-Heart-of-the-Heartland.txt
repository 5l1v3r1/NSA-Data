DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Omaha - The Heart of the Heartland<br>FROM:<br>NSA/CSS USSTRATCOM (F1C)<br>Run Date: 07/26/2004<br>FROM: <br>NSA/CSS USSTRATCOM (F1C) <br>(U) "Where the heck is Omaha? Who the heck cares?" My high<br>school sweetheart gave me a t-shirt with this written on it after she<br>and her family vacationed in Nebraska. I often teased her about<br>being a "farm girl," saving up her pennies to go to the "movin'<br>picture show," and riding her horse to school. I would have never<br>thought I'd marry that girl. And it is even more surprising that I<br>now live "in the middle of nowhere" with my first love and our two<br>children.<br>(U) Why would you want to live in Omaha? I get asked that<br>question often as I occasionally return to NSA headquarters. I<br>simply respond by saying that the Omaha metropolitan area "still<br>cares about the county fair." In the midst of a city of 390,000<br>(716,000 in the metropolitan area) that's trying hard to be<br>considered a "real" city, there's a down-to-earth simplicity you<br>would typically find in a small farming town.<br>(U) You'll find gentlemen farmers working in fields very close to<br>the growing contractor community building new facilities near the<br>base. You'll find dust-covered pickup trucks taking a trip to town<br>being passed by a Lexus on its way to the next important business<br>meeting. On the radio, the agricultural digest follows the morning<br>financial report where you can find out how much pork bellies are<br>going for. No matter how hard it tries, Omaha will always be at war<br>with itself - trying hard to transform itself into a big city, but never<br>able to separate itself from its agricultural roots.<br>(U) To put it bluntly, Omaha is a nice place to live. There is<br>something for everyone. The most popular activity is football.<br>Nebraskans are known as football nuts. Most everyone follows the<br>University of Nebraska-Lincoln Cornhuskers. You will certainly<br>notice the "Husker Nation" on football Saturdays. Almost everyone<br>will be wearing a red shirt. Flags and banners will be displayed on<br>houses. And you'll see cars with pennants or magnetic placards<br>from the Old Market in Omaha to 9th Street in Lincoln.<br>(U) The Omaha area has "tons" of recreational activities from little<br>league baseball and peewee football, to girl's soccer, softball, and<br>volleyball, to parks and bike trails that wind throughout the city. If<br>culture and sophistication is more to your liking, Omaha has a<br>symphony, several community playhouses, the Joslyn Art Museum,<br>the Durham Western Heritage Museum, a botanical garden, and<br>the world class Henry Doorly Zoo. This year is special since we are<br>celebrating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition:<br>activities and displays commemorating this accomplishment are<br>planned throughout the summer up and down the "Mighty Mo."<br>(U) Omaha has a variety of restaurants. Although it has most of the<br>national and regional chains, I find it more interesting to go to the<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '04 <br>1.  Letter From Ottawa<br>2.  Yakima: Fertile<br>Valley in the High<br>Desert<br>3.  Life in Alice<br>4.  Omaha - The Heart<br>of the Heartland<br>5.  Life in the Big Apple<br>6.  'Dropping Anchor' in<br>Anchorage<br><br> </p>many family restaurants you'll find through the area. One, for<br>example, is Johnny's CafÃ©. Many, many years ago, as people<br>were migrating west, a young polish immigrant crossed the<br>Missouri and stopped for the evening. Someone was looking for<br>someone who knew how to cook. "Johnny" volunteered to cook<br>vittles for supper, and the rest is history. He stayed in town and<br>opened a restaurant that his family has been operating ever since.<br>His restaurant has now gone Hollywood as it was in a scene in the<br>movie "About Schmidt" starring Jack Nicholson.<br>(U) In my three years at STRATCOM, my family has really enjoyed<br>our time here. My kids are beginning to ask me how long we can<br>stay. From the moment we arrived, my wife and kids easily<br>transitioned - the move was a perfect fit for everyone. I've found<br>the work at the command to be very diverse. No single day is the<br>same. As frustrating as it may be working with the command to<br>incorporate four new missions into day-to-day operations, it's<br>much more satisfying when you finally accomplish the task at<br>hand. And the next task is already right there for you dig into.<br>(U) "Where the heck is Omaha?" It's right in the middle of the<br>heartland of America where you'll get a smile and hello from the<br>cashier at the grocery store. "Who the heck cares?" You'll find that<br>a lot down-to-earth people in your neighborhood that care about<br>you and your family. When you PCS to NSA STRATCOM, you'll<br>probably drive into town on I-80 from Iowa. You'll see a sign on the<br>bridge over the Missouri River that succinctly sums up what it's like<br>living in Omaha; "Welcome to Nebraska - The good life." Hurry up<br>and buy your Husker shirt and I'll see you soon around town.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
