Title of Change:	DNI Processing of RINGBILL Access

System(s):	VISIONQUEST :	SubSystem(s):	No Subsystem(s) Entered

Description of Change. This is a partially historical ECP to track efforts performed for processing the

DNI portion of RINGBILL. The initial processing of RINGBILL will be
performed on our legacy WC2/XKS systems (using Trireme for VoIP & VTC
traffic). Once we stand up SKIDROWE, the processing will transfer to that
solution so we will need to be cognizant of any and all requirements that shoulc
be defined for the SKIDROWE team to enable our solution.

Reason for Change:

Mission Impact:

Additional Info:
Last CCB Entry:

Because we are initially using our legacy systems there will be extra work
required to configure them and the network to be capable of higher than
normal throughput. There will also be work to determine what kind of filtering
is required so that we don't overwhelm our PINWALE partitions. Finally, it is
already apparent that further work will be required on the VoIP processing to
associate signaling with media cuts. Once that is complete we will be able to
look into filtering based on dialing patterns.

We now have access to the RINGBILL DNI and rather than waiting until the
June/July timeframe to use the new solution for processing, we have
developed an interim solution for processing the high data rates on existing
architecture.

These efforts are an interim solution to process the RINGBILL signal months
earlier than we orginally planned. Resources will have to be prioritized against
other efforts.

Blarney-55-12	Work in Progress

ECP Lead:

Title of Change:	Deployment of TURTLEPOWER system in VQ environment

Site(s):	No Site(s) Entered	Proiect(s):	No Project(s) Entered

Svstem(s):	VISIONQUEST:	SubSvstem(s):	No Subsystem(s) Entered

Description of Change. This EqP w¡h encompass working with CES	t0 stand up and

forward deploy a TURT^POWER system fonH^Durpos^Tprocessing VoIP.
Installation will occur	followed by deployment to TP and testing againsl

the RINGBILL data. If successful we could turn this into an operational system
and work through the details for tasking and number normalization.

Reason for Change:	The primary purpose of this system will be to determine its VoIP processing

capabilities, though other capabilities will likely be examined as well. Trireme
requires some development to support desk phone conversations of the
RINGBILL data and it has been conveyed that TURTLEPOWER has the
capability already. We are proposing deploying a TURTLEPOWER system to
test this capability and potentially provide a solution for forwarding SIGINT to
the to TOPIs in a compressed timeframe (comparitvely to the Trireme solution.

This also provides BLARNEY an opportunity to help TURTLEPOWER develop
their capabilities by using potentially unique data found in the BLARNEY
environments. Any derived enhancements to TURTLEPOWER will help the
agency as a whole.

Mission Impact:	This effort will potentially allow us to deliver RINGBILL voice cuts to the TOPI

sooner than waiting for the Trireme solution. It also allows us to make sure
we’re using the best processing solution for the job.

This will be worked in accordance to priorités as set by the BAT branch so
other mission will not be negatively impacted.
