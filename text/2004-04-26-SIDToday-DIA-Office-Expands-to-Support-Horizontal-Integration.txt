Houy<br>DIA Executive Representative to NSA<br>Run Date: 04/26/2004<br>FROM: Sharon A. Houy <br>DIA Executive Representative to NSA <br>(U) Beginning in October 2003, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has been rapidly<br>expanding its presence and analytic endeavors with SID to meet our Directors' goals for<br>horizontal integration. We have gone from a one man (so to speak) office to a three-person<br>operation. Many of you have met us: Sharon Houy, the new Executive Representative, and Chris<br>Yates, the first-ever Deputy Representative. Our administrative assistant will be on board soon.<br>Our new spaces <br><br> <br><br>(S//SI) Since our arrival we have been working on new agreements between DIA and NSA on<br>information sharing, beginning with the new MOU regarding the sharing of terrorist information,<br>focused on Iraq. Under this novel agreement, JITF-CT ( Joint Intelligence Task Force Combating Terrorism ) analysts at DIA will gain access to NSA databases to enhance their<br>analysis of Iraqi terrorism issues. This pilot is pushing new information-sharing concepts that we<br>hope will prove to be models for community-wide collaboration in the future.<br>(S) A new umbrella MOA* between DIA and SID is being approved that will expedite the<br>detailing of personnel between DIA and NSA for future information-sharing activities. This will<br>allow us to follow through in a timely fashion on many new initiatives, including the DIRNSA's<br>offer to re-look Libyan WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) information and DIA's expansion of<br>its analytic presence in the GIS/CAD Multi-Agency Center .<br>(S/SI) Information sharing between DIA and NSA is nothing new. We've had programs in place<br>for many years with DEFSMAC (forty to be exact!), CIHS , the IOTC , the Counterterrorism<br>product line, the GIS/CAD Multi-Agency Center, Regional Targets, and SSIO . DIA's strength to<br>SIGINT production is its all-source subject-matter expertise and research methodologies applied<br>to the NSA data. We are even running DIA data in the KSP !<br>(U) If you haven't met us, have an idea for collaboration or simply a question, please don't<br>hesitate to call us at <br>or visit us in our new spaces in <br> <br>Sharing a desk in the old spaces <br>(U) Notes: <br>* MOA = Memorandum of Agreement <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p></p>
