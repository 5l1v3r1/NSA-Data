Having served as Special Advisor<br>to the President and Secretary of State and North Korea Policy Coordinator in the Clinton<br>Administration, Ambassador Sherman is especially knowledgeable on the subject of North Korea.<br>She was, in fact, one of the principal negotiators of the 1994 Agreed Framework that sought to<br>prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.<br>(U) Ambassador Sherman gave her assessment of how the North Korean leadership views the<br>world right now. She noted that they were following events in Iraq very attentively, and<br>undoubtedly recognized the "awesome" military power of the U.S. However, rather than<br>aborting their nuclear development plans for fear of U.S. military action, Ambassador Sherman<br>believed that they had taken the opposite lesson: that a state without a nuclear capability would<br>always be vulnerable to attack.<br>(U) She noted that North Korea had seen how Iran and Pakistan were successfully avoiding<br>punishment for their nuclear development efforts, and felt encouraged by this. In addition, for<br>various reasons, the North Koreans did not feel threatened by the U.S., China or South Korea at<br>this time. As a result, she believed they would continue their nuclear program, and may in fact<br>have already succeeded in developing such a weapon. Ambassador Sherman predicted that the<br>U.S. would not seriously reengage with the North Koreans on the issue until after the U.S.<br>presidential elections.<br>(U) Ambassador Sherman noted that SIGINT on the issue was "absolutely indispensable" and<br>"critical for arms control and verification," and she thanked NSA for its contributions in that<br>regard.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
