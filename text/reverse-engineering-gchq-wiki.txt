[editl TEA-RE

The TEA Reverse Engineering team is part of the TECA (Technical Enabling Covert Access) Product Centre.

Our main service is to provide expertise in hardware and embedded software reverse engineering (RE) of
cryptographic related products and equipments. The expertise and tools provided are also applicable to
hardware forensic analysis and evaluations of tamper protection/detection implementations.

The team provide integrated circuit RE expertise and are the main point of contact for liaison with other UK
intelligence agencies on such topics, including research and development of techniques for defeating secure
microprocessors (e.g. smartcards).

Due to the nature of the reverse engineering work, it is covered by ECIs and exceeds the clasification of the
GCWiki. Further details of our lab equipment and work on current products is sited on CAWiki pages.
Accessed only by INSIGHT account.

[editl Experience Reverse Engineering

The TEA-RE team provide a Reverse Engineering Taster Course; a 5-day on-site event where GCHQ and
CESG staff can use their skills to attempt to reverse engineer a black box, with the aim of producing an
emulator for SIGINT use. Using equipment such as logic analysers and chip programmers as well as in-house
hardware and software tools, the course is designed to promote 'thinking' like a reverse engineer and
understanding that it's not as simple as it looks.

Hints are given by RE staff if necessary, but we will let you make mistakes - it's part of the process. There is
no set way to finish the task.

For further details about the course contact or possiblly attending the next event please contact

[editl Current Equipment and Capabilities

The Reverse Enginering Lab is situated in C1-D3, where we have a dedicated lab for investigative work. Our
equipment list is available, which includes products from LeCroy, HP and Agilent.
