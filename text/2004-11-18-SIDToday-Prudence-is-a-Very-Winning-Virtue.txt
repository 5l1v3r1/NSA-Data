I'd like to thank all the people who submitted a name for me to choose<br>from last month. As you can see, I've chosen a name, with the help of the SID OPSEC Working<br>Group. My new name is Prudence. Isn't it pretty? <br> of Menwith Hill Station<br>submitted the winning name.<br>(U//FOUO) In his submission, he quoted someone named Whewell who said, "Prudence<br>supposes the value of the end to be assumed, and refers only to the adaptation of the means. It<br>is the relation of the right means for given ends." Seems to me that's a fancy way of saying that<br>being prudent in the information we give out (by practicing good OPSEC), keeps our people and<br>mission safer. That definitely sounds good to me!<br>(U//FOUO) In the coming months, you'll be seeing a lot more of me as I begin my new job<br>spreading the word about OPSEC across SID. You should also begin seeing a renewed emphasis<br>on OPSEC throughout your daily work life, as the SID OPSEC team works with your office<br>coordinators to broaden the scope of the OPSEC program across our missions. Remember,<br>though -- you don't have to wait for someone to tap you on the shoulder to start bringing<br>OPSEC into your job! Just think about the five steps, and begin applying them on your own. In<br>case you need a refresher, they are:<br>1.  Identify Critical Information<br>2.  Analyze the Threat<br>3.  Analyze Vulnerabilities<br>4.  Assess the Risk<br>5.  Apply Countermeasures.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about OPSEC in SID, you can contact <br>or <br> on <br>. I'll be working closely with them to make sure you get all the<br>support you need. I look forward to talking to you again soon!<br>Yours truly, <br>Prudence <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
