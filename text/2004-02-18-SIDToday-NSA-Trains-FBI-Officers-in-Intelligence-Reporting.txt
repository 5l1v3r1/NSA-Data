The overall objectives for the students included how to be a<br>reports officer, how to write intelligence reports, and how to understand their role in the FBI, the<br>Intelligence Community and the U.S. Government.<br>(C) Mr. <br> from the Office of General Counsel kicked off the 2 and Â½ hour session with a<br>brief overview of the legal responsibilities and issues facing NSA analysts when preparing<br>information for dissemination. The Customer Response Reporting Board followed with a basic<br>"SIGINT Reporting 101" briefing given by Col.<br>. He provided a general overview of<br>SIGINT and wove in examples and stories to explain the reporting and dissemination process.<br>The final briefing was presented by Ms. <br> from the CT SIGINT Development Branch.<br>Her fast-paced briefing on convergence highlighted real world issues faced by CT analysts from<br>collection to dissemination.<br>(C) It was a good opportunity for us at NSA to share how we do our work and provide insight<br>into the complexity and difficulty of our business. It also was an opportunity to dispel some<br>Hollywood myths about NSA. That said, we believe some of the FBI reports officers were more<br>impressed by the actual facts about NSA than by what's shown in the movies! The FBI analysts'<br>consensus was that the briefing hit the mark. Their comments and questions will help us to<br>tailor future presentations, to include an encore presentation of the briefing planned for March<br>and a formal course for customers that Customer Gateway is in the process of coordinating.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
