mrod Mission

 

What analytic problems is Nymrod trying to
address?

We need to search for the target behind what's been
extracted (find reported information about targeted
persons)

HUMAN beings are central to most targets

We need to cope with linguistic variation among entity
names (esp Person names)

We need to resolve Entity "coreference" problems using
contextual information ("Evidence")
