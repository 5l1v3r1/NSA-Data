What analytic problems is Nymrod trying to
address?

-	We need to search for the target behind what's been
extracted (find reported information about targeted
persons)

-	HUMAN beings are central to most targets

-	We need to cope with linguistic variation among entity
names (esp Person names)

-	We need to resolve Entity "coreference" problems using
contextual information ("Evidence")
