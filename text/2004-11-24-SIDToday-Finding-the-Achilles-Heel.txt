The military are predominantly<br>Navy and Air Force, but all four services are represented. Subordinate to the Joint Forces<br>Command (JFCOM), JWAC directly supports combatant commands, components, and<br>interagency customers. JWAC is not an intelligence center and has no intelligence or Indications<br>&amp; Warning production requirements... So what does the JWAC do?<br>(U//FOUO) JWAC provides the combatant commands, Joint Staff, and other customers with<br>effects-based precision targeting options for selected networks and nodes in order to carry out<br>the national security and military strategies of the United States during peace, crisis, and war.<br>JWAC has the ability to conduct comprehensive technical analyses to identify critical networks,<br>nodes, and other points of influence within a threat's infrastructure systems. Recommendations<br>are made for both kinetic and non-kinetic solution sets.<br>(U//FOUO) JWAC provides "responsive" analytical solutions based on desired effect, objective<br>and end state; and analysis and assessment based on a combination of network expertise and<br>weapon understanding. Developmental areas include: Automated Information Extraction System<br>(AIES), Advanced Collateral Damage Estimation Tool (ACDET), etc.<br>(U//FOUO) The NSGI Warfighter Imagery Library -- an NGA-sponsored imagery library that<br>provides rapid access to over 7 years of overhead imagery -- is located at JWAC. Remotely<br>accessible via SIPRNET and JWICS, its vital statistics include 24 x 7 operations, 14 days-worth of<br>imagery online for fast access, over 2.5 million images online, and 100% coverage of 35<br>countries. In a related initiative, JWAC is now hosting two additional libraries for still-frame<br>airborne (U2/Global Hawk) and motion (PREDATOR) imagery. The Community Airborne Library<br>Architecture (CALA) provides a central repository for unexploited digital airborne imagery; it<br>provides web-enabled access for the Defense Department and Intelligence Community across<br>multiple security domains.<br>(U//FOUO) JWAC is a voracious user of intelligence products and services, including those<br>provided by NSA. However, the relationship is more than just customer and producer.<br>Opportunities for collaboration in the past resulted in timely, enhanced support to the warfighter<br>during the early days of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. As we continue the Global War on<br>Terrorism, new opportunities are identified and analytic partnerships are formed.<br>(U//FOUO) The Commander of JWAC is CAPT David Ott, USN. Executive Director is Mr. Bob<br>Tolhurst. Deputy Commander is COL Eric Stanhagen, USA.
