S3TSD) answers to help<br>posture SID against strategic surprise. We rely heavily on the<br>expertise of A&amp;P target offices, DA technologists, private industry<br>and academia as we track the indicators of change in the current<br>and planned usage of technologies by our targets. The stronger the<br>target evidence, the more certain SID is that its technology<br>developments and investments are on track.<br>(U//FOUO) Our primary deliverable is a Top 10 List of Target<br>Technologies which helps drive SID's budget builds and investment<br>portfolio. It is a living list and we are always looking for expert<br>input. Please visit our web site ("go t3c") to comment on our list<br>and view our other products.<br>(U//FOUO) "How do you scale the T3 process to cover the<br>broad spectrum of targets and technologies of concern to<br>SID?"<br>(U//FOUO) As a SIGINT Development center, we're developing the<br>"how to" for trends analysis and building a knowledge-based<br>system to support the maintenance and improvement of the Top<br>10 List. We're drawing upon existing Agency solutions for the base<br>capability and adding in competitive intelligence techniques and<br>tools to mine the Internet and visually display the results for<br>analysts.<br>(U//FOUO) We have billets and want to grow our center with<br>talented, can-do people.
