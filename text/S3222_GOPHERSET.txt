(TS//SI//REL) GOPHERSET is a software implant for GSM (Global System for

(U//FOUO) GOPHERSET - Operational Schematic

(TS//SI//REL) Modern SIM cards (Phase 2+) have an application program interface
known as the SIM Toolkit (STK). The STK has a suite of proactive commands that
allow the SIM card to issue commands and make requests to the handset.
GOPHERSET uses STK commands to retrieve the requested information and to
exfiltrate data via SMS. After the GOPHERSET file is compiled, the program is
loaded onto the SIM card using either a Universal Serial Bus (USB) smartcard
reader or via over-the-air provisioning. In both cases, keys to the card may be
required to install the application depending on the service provider's security
configuration.
