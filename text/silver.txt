On Thursday, 11/5/69, the 
SILVERZEPHYR (SZ) access began fonwarding FAA DNI records
to NSAW via the FAA system
installed at the partner's site. 550 coordinated with the
Data Flow Office and forwarded numerous sample files to a
test partition for validation, which was completely
successful. 550 will continue to monitor the flow and
collection to ensure a ny anomalies are identified and
corrected as required. SILVERZEPHYR will continue to
provide customers with authorized, transit DNR collection.
550 is working with the partner to gain access to an
additional BeGbs of DNI data on their peering network,
bundled in 18 increments. The OAKSTAR team, along with
support from NSAT and GNDA, just completed a 12 day SIGINT
survey at site, which identified over 230 new links. During
the survey, GNDA worked with the partner to test the output
of their ACS system. OAKSTAR is also working with NSAT to
examine snapshots taken by the partner in Brazil and
Colombia, both of which may contain internal communications
for those countries.
