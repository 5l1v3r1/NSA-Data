SUMMARY: ON OR AROUND 12 JUNE 2011, CALL SIGNS KAMYAB AND MINAWAL WERE KILLED BY TWO
UNIDENTIFIED TALIBAN DURING AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY IVO TIZNI, NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH DISTRICT, HELMAND
PROVINCE, AFG. SUCH ACTIVITY REVEALS SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND FRUSTRATIONS AMONG SENIOR TALIBAN LEADERS,
WHICH HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.

OVERVIEW. ON OR AROUND THE AFTERNOON OF 12 JUNE 2011, TALIBAN SUB-COMMANDERS AND WELL-KNOWN
IED MAKERS, CALL SIGN (C/S) KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL WERE KILLED BY TWO UNIDENTIFIED (UID) TALIBAN
MEMBERS IN BAYGHAZ VILLAGE //CNA//, IVO TIZNI VILLAGE //MGRS: 41S PS 572 196//, NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH
DISTRICT, HELMAND PROVINCE, AFG (SOURCE COMMENT THE TRUE NAMES OF C/S KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL ARE
UNKNOWN). SOME LOW-LEVEL TALIBAN MEMBERS IN NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH DISTRICT, SUCH AS THE TWO WHO
KILLED C/S KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL, ARE ATTEMPTING TO SUPPLEMENT MONETARY AND RESOURCE SHORTAGES,
NOW COMMON TO THE INSURGENCY ACROSS MUCH OF NORTHERN HELMAND PROVINCE SINCE LATE 2010 WITH
PETTY THEFT. INFIGHTING AMONG SENIOR TALIBAN LEADERS FROM AFG, AND PAK //MGRS: 42R UU 095 445//,
STEADILY MORE PRONOUNCED SINCE MID-2010, CONTINUES TO DISRUPT TALIBAN SUPPLY CHAINS. SUCH DISSENT IS
AGGRAVATED BY THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN (OBL) ON OR ABOUT 2 MAY 2011.

ELABORATION OF THE KILLING. THE TWO UID TALIBAN WHO KILLED KAMYAB AND MINAWAL WERE STAGED ALONG
AN UNKNOWN, RURAL ROUTE BETWEEN QATS VILLAGE //MGRS: 41S PR 637 933//, NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH
DISTRICT, AND TIZNI VILLAGE, LYING IN WAIT TO ROB PASSERSBY. UPON RECOGNIZING KAMYAB AND MINAWAL,
WHO WERE HEADING NORTH TO THE TIZNI BAZAAR //MGRS: 41S PS 571 199//, NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH DISTRICT-
ON A MOTORCYCLE, THE TWO UID TALIBAN REALIZED THEY WOULD BE PUNISHED IF THE SUB-COMMANDERS LATER
REPORTED AN UNSANCTIONED CHECKPOINT TO SENIOR TAUBAN COMMANDERS (SOURCE COMMENT IT IS
UNCERTAIN WHERE THE SUB COMMANDERS BEGAN THEIR DRIVE. IT IS LIKELY THEY RODE ON A PAMIR BRAND
MOTORCYCLE). RATHER THAN FACE UNKNOWN PUNISHMENT FROM MORE SENIOR TALIBAN COMMANDERS, THE TWO
UID TALIBAN QUICKLY DETERMINED IT WAS BEST TO KILL C/S KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL ONE OF THE UID TALIBAN
SHOT C/S KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL WITH AN AK 47, LEAVING THEIR BODIES BEHIND (SOURCE COMMENT IT IS
UNCLEAR WHICH MAN FIRED ON KAMYAB AND MINAWAL). THE UID TALIBAN DROVE OFF WITH THE MOTORCYCLE
USED BY THE TWO SUB COMMANDERS, AND ALSO STOLE AN AK 47 CARRIED BY EITHER C/S KAMYAB OR C/S MINAWAL
(NFI). C/S KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL WERE LIKELY BURIED SOMETIME DURING THE AFTERNOON OF 13 JUNE 2011 IN
SAREE WALI //CNA//, A VILLAGE LOCATED NORTH OF SARBESHA VILLAGE //MGRS: 41S PR 626 973//, NORTHERN MUSA
QAL'AH DISTRICT.

NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH TALIBAN SUPPLIES. SUPPLIES REMAINING IN ABUNDANCE TO THE TALIBAN IN NORTHERN
MUSA QAL'AH DISTRICT INCLUDE AK 47, PKM, AND RPG ROUNDS. THE AVAILABILITY OF IED COMPONENTS; MORE
COSTLY THAN SMALL-ARMS, MEDIUM MACHINEGUN, AND RPG ROUNDS; IS DECLINING IN NORTHERN MUSA QAL'AH
DISTRICT DUE TO CONTINUED DISRUPTIONS OF TAUBAN FINANCING, SOME OF WHICH IS RELATIVE TO SENIOR
TALIBAN LEADER INFIGHTING. NFI.

SENIOR TALIBAN INFIGHTING. FEW AFGHAN OR PAKISTANI SENIOR TALIBAN LEADERS TRULY BELIEVED OBL WAS
MAINTAINING A HUMBLE, PIOUS LIFESTYLE AS WAS OFTEN PUBLICIZED. UNTIL HIS DEATH, EVEN FEWER SENIOR
TALIBAN LEADERS WERE LIKELY TO VERBALIZE SUCH SKEPTICISM FOR FEAR OF APPEARING UNFAITHFUL TO AL QAIDA
IDEALS, SOME OF WHICH ARE SHARED BY THE TALIBAN. SOME SENIOR TALIBAN LEADERS FROM AFG VIEW
REVELATIONS REGARDING THE EXTRAVAGANT NATURE OF OBL'S LIVING CONDITIONS AS INDICATIVE OF HIS SELF-
INTEREST AND AS A TRUE, LOW MEASURE OF HIS ALLEGIANCE TO AL-QAIDA. SINCE OBL’S DEATH, SOME AFGHAN
SENIOR TALIBAN LEADERS HAVE CANDIDLY DENOUNCED TIES TO OBL, BLAMING HIS DECADENCE FOR A LACK OF
FUNDING TO BOTH AL QAIDA AND THE TALIBAN. MOREOVER, SOME SENIOR TALIBAN LEADERS IN AFG BLAME
PAKISTANI TALIBAN FOR MISJUDGING OBL'S SUPPOSEDLY AUSTERE UFESTYLE, SEEDING MISGIVINGS RELATIVE TO
HOW TALIBAN LEADERS IN PAK ARE FUNDING THE WAR AGAINST COALITION FORCES (CF) AND THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE ISLAMIC REPUBUC OF AFG. THE CONFLUENCE OF SUCH DOUBTS RESULTS IN FURTHER SUPPLY AND FINANCIAL
SHORTAGES TO LOW-LEVEL TALIBAN FIGHTERS, CAUSING SOME, AS IN THE CASE OF THE TWO UID TALIBAN WHO
KILLED C/S KAMYAB AND C/S MINAWAL, TO ACT ON THEIR OWN ACCORD TO SURVIVE. PRIVATELY, SOME LOW-LEVEL
TALIBAN FIGHTERS VIEW THE DEDICATION OF THEIR MID AND SENIOR-LEVEL COMMANDERS WITH HESITATION,
PROMPTING THE FEELING EVERY MAN IS FIGHTING AND ACCOUNTABLE ONLY FOR HIMSELF (SOURCE COMMENT OF
COURSE IN GROUPS OR MEETINGS, NONE OF THE FIGHTERS WOULD EXPRESS SUCH DOUBTS).
