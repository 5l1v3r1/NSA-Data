(C)<br>(C) On 6 October, <br> the Research Director for DIA's Directorate for Analysis, briefed<br>SID leadership on VADM Jacoby's* plan to realign DoD all-source analytic resources. This plan,<br>officially titled the Defense Intelligence Analysis Program, but better known as "the 3Ms" for one<br>of its basic tenets -- Master, Measure, and Monitor -- represents a fundamental change in the<br>way that DIA approaches analysis.<br>(C) <br> outlined the concerns that led to the development of this new plan -- the focus on<br>current intelligence at the expense of strategic intelligence, the Intelligence Community's<br>seeming inability to identify potential crisis areas before they erupted, and unidentified<br>intelligence gaps. The Master, Measure, Monitor plan realigns the analytic responsibilities of the<br>various elements of the Defense Intelligence Community, and is designed to refine the<br>community's ability to provide global situational awareness and warning of developing security<br>issues while developing analytic depth against critical enduring issues.<br>(C) This is accomplished by grouping intelligence efforts into three categories:<br>Master : the requirement to understand some issues and nations in great depth and<br>breadth -- know everything about everything;<br>Measure : to understand selected elements of some targets in great depth -- know<br>everything about some topics; and<br>Monitor : maintain global situational awareness -- know something about everything.<br>In addition, the plan is designed to eliminate analytic duplication by assigning responsibility for<br>each topic area to that element of the community, (DIA, the Service Intelligence elements or<br>Command Intelligence) with the optimum capability to accomplish the assigned tasks.<br>(S) <br> noted that this plan correlates well with the recent briefings on the National<br>Intelligence Priorities Framework 5-year outlook, briefed two weeks ago at the National<br>Intelligence Analysis and Production Board. He also stated that DIA will begin working on the<br>major target areas in the "Master" country list by conducting a thorough review of the IC's<br>collective knowledge on North Korean nuclear development.<br>(S) A working group of DIA, NSA, and NGA experts in this area will stand up shortly to begin this<br>effort. Follow-on groups will bring together experts in the other topics and nations that comprise<br>the "Master" list.<br>(U) Notes: <br>* Vice Admiral Jacoby is the DIA Director <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
