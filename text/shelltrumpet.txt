(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) SHELLTRUMPET Processes it|'s One Trillionth
Metadata Record

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) On December 21, 2012 SHELLTRUMPET processed its
One Trillionth metadata record. SHELLTRUMPET began as a near-real-time
metadata analyzer on Dec 8, 2007 for a CLASSIC collection system. In its
five year history, numerous other systems from across the Agency have come
to use SHELLTRUMPET1s processing capabilities for performance monitoring,
direct E-Mail tip alerting, TRAFFICTHIEF tipping, and Real-Time Regional
Gateway (RTRG) filtering and ingest. Though it took five years to get to
the one trillion mark, almost half of this volume was processed in this
calendar year, and half of that volume was from SSO's DANCINGOASIS.
SHELLTRUMPET is currently processing Two Billion call events/day from
select SSO (Ram-M, OAKSTAR, MYSTIC and NCSC enabled systems), MUSKETEER,
and Second Party systems. We will be expanding its reach into other SSO
systems over the course of 2013. The Trillion records processed have
resulted in over 35 Million tips to TRAFFICTHIEF.
