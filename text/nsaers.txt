(S//SI//REL) This summer Special United St.Rt.es T.iaisnn Activity Germany
(SUSLAG) and joint SIGINT Activity (fSA) representatives, along with
Counterterrorism analysts from S2I, became the first US visitors at Schdningen, a
Bundesnachrichtendienst* (BND) FORNSAT collection site located in northern
Germany

(S//SI//REL) During these visits, BND senior site managers and analysts provided
briefings on their mission, site manning, technical capabilities, as well as current
and advanced analytic tools and techniques. These visits in June and July provided
insights into the BND's collection, processing, and analytic capabilities, and
promoted the close technical partnership between JSA and the BND.

(S//SI//REL) Before the reunification of Germany, Schdningen (located on the
former East-West German border) collected East German radar, radio, and
microwave communications. When Germany reunified in 1990, BND personnel at
Schdningen were forced to recreate their role and mission, Schdningen did so
proudly, and now plays a key role in the BND's Counterterrorism (CT) and Force
Protection efforts by collecting mobile communication systems (specifically
Thurava. INMARSAT, and GSM),

(S//SI//REL) Today, Schdningen is manned with approximately 100 personnel. There

(S//SI//REL) Schdningen personnel focus on development and production of voice
and facsimile traffic collected from Thuraya, INMARSAT and GSM. Schdningen
collects over 40O,00^rhuray^ut^e^ay^Mi00^NMARSAT^ut^^i^6i00^GSM

network. E-mail is also collected at site, with an average of 62,000 collects per day,
NSA benefits from this collection, especially the Thuraya intercepts from
which the BND shares on a daily basis.

(S//SI//REL) Site analysts and linguists are responsible for evaluating collected
traffic, transcribing voice cuts and forwarding raw cuts on to their HQS for further
evaluation and reporting. To improve their collection and SIGDEV capabilities, site
engineers have developed several systems to improve BND call-chaining
capabilities, data-viewing of voice and fax data, and data-forwarding to BND IIQS.
Development efforts at a field site are unusual for BND, and it was interesting to
learn about these on-site efforts.

(S//SI//REL) The second visit by JSA and NSA Headquarters analysts represented
the first technical exchange with BND Schdningen. US analysts were shown several
BND analytic tool suites, some of which were under development, BND contract

software developers and analysts sought regular feedback on the utility of these
tools and techniques. These tool suites, such as MIRA 4, integrate multiple
database analytic functions (such as viewing voice and listening to fax), much like
NSA Headquarters has UIS (User Integrated Services), In some ways, these tools
have features that surpass US SIGINT capabilities, Among a series of interesting
items, NSA analysts noted that DND analysts could seamlessly move from VERAS
(call-chaining software) to the associated voice cuts, DND Schbningen also
performed geolocational selection of mobile communicants. For instance, they
could define any particular geographical area, like	and select any

communicant that dwelled in that area for several minutes,

(S//SI//REL) DND Schdningen developers also demonstrated a software prototype
that uses Social Network Analysis algorithms against metadata to discover and
assess target groups among other things, looking for information flow, The goal (at
least in part) was to monitor these targets in the background within analyst-set
parameters, with alerts to notify the analyst when any anomalous measurement
appeared, and potentially to steer front-end collection. They claimed to have some
successes on small groups on which they had good collection,

(S//SI//REL) They seemed interested in also characterizing movement patterns on
geocoordinates to find persons such as couriers (terrorist or otherwise), then using
that characterization for SIGDEV discovery purposes and predictive (trend)
analysis, DND also showed us that they are interested not only in selection based
on movement patterns or network structures, but also in hardware changes. They
used a variety of algorithms (such as fuzzy logic) to discover these patterns. The
DND responded positively to NSA's request for a copy of MIRA4 and VERAS
software, and made several requests from NSA concerning target and tool
development and data,

(S//SI//REL) This first series of meetings represents a new level of engagement for
NSA and its German partner. We hope that this dialogue continues, and makes each
partner more capable of satisfying common SIGINT requirements. * *
