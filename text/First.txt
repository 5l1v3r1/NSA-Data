MHS and GCHQ ?Get in the Game with Target Development for
World of Warcraft Online Gaming

 

Although online gaming may seem like an innocuous form of
entertainment, when the basic features and capabilities are examined, it could
potentially become a target-rich communication network. Online gaming represents a
technology that is rapidly growing in popularity worldwide. World of Warcraft is
one with an impressive following of gaming enthusiasts. With over 10 million users
worldwide, WOW may be providing SIGINT targets a way to hide in plain sight. Targets
have been spotted receiving ?no reply" emails from gaming providers and GCHQ
have correlated known SIGINT targets to online gaming events. The New
Mission Development Center at MHS, the Global Network Exploitation (OPD-GNE) and
the Applied Research Special Topics (B18) organization at GCHQ are working together

to filter the survey environment for this traffic and ektract various types of
Wow metadata forelelth development and network knowledge enrichment.

Communication is at the core of online gaming
and in Wow there are many ways to
communicate and interact in lhe virtual world. A
player has a character lo and can join different
groups. A "party" brings players together for a
common, defined purpose or guest. It is
temporary and task-oriented. "Guilds," on the
other hand, are for characters with persisting
relationships and can take on an organizational
structure with ranks and positions. The guild is
more permanent and ideological. Characters can
communicate verbally and non-verbally and may
set up different types of channels to talk within a
guild or privately, characterto character.

 

World of Warcraft

recently asked llee's New lvlission Development Center 
to support an online gaming research effort focusing on Wow. Eager to assist in a new
potential area of target development, the NileC discussed metadata needs with 
in order to enable Wow target and network research in the arena. The
NileiC engaged SHORT, an open source packet-sniffing software, which runs on all
FCRN SAT survey packet data, to filter out Wow packets. provided several
Wow protocol parsing scripts to process the traffic and produce Warcraft metadata from
all NileC survey. These logs are now being forwarded back to for
additional analysis, target development and network knowledge enrichment. By fusing
information from different systems, databases, and resources has correlated
target entities to Wow logon events and continues to uncover potential SICIN value by
identifying accounts, characters, and guilds related to Islamic Ektremist Groups, Nuclear
Proliferation and Arms oealing.

Wow certainly provides entertainment for a large number of people
worldwide, but its gaming format can provide a virtual organizational platform for
potential SIGINT targets as well. Furthermore, this technology can assist the target and
simultaneously assist the SIGINT community in tracking that target. The Wow gaming
infrastructure provides ample information for network development through the data
passed during Wow messages, such as country and time zone information, local IP
addresses and realm server addresses. In terms of active target development, there are
clear parallels: tradiljonal SIGINT development may follow emails, chat and buddy lists,
whereas Wow target development may follow character IDs and logons, gaming
communication channels and guilds.

MHS el?lo will continue to develop and collaborate ol?l this
potentially lucrative venue.
