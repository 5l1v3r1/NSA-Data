The quandary here is that PROFORMA is<br>a branch of COMINT (as explained so eloquently by DIRNSA during his keynote address at the<br>inaugural OP-PROFORMA conference in January of 2003), and deals almost exclusively with the<br>internals of the given communications link/system. The confusion extends when you find<br>PROFORMA being passed by the most common of communications systems. So saying, look<br>inside a common multichannel system and you could find dozens of modems. There's one<br>passing e-mail; that's COMINT. There's another one passing a fax; that's COMINT. Why, here's<br>one passing air surveillance; that's TECH SIGINT! It doesn't quite work. In reality, PROFORMA is<br>more a family of functions associated with sensors, vice a specific set of modulations, frequency<br>ranges, or users.<br>(U) If one draws a venn chart of COMINT, ELINT and FIS, PROFORMA finds itself in the junction<br>of the three. If it's pushed too far into any single category, confusion ensues.<br>(U) To address this, a formal PROFORMA Business Plan is being developed as an Enterprise<br>initiative. The result of the business plan should be the institutionalization of PROFORMA.<br>-- (U) Please provide suggestions for future article content.<br>(U) JPC has been asked to provide an article for NSA daily, describing PROFORMA, its origins, its<br>uses, and its future. This TECH SIGINT article tickles the subject, but doesn't answer the mail.<br>(U) I welcome your feedback.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
