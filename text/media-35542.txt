Previous Work/Current Techniques

ICTR-related techniques
. Identification of events by content
. Tor node dictionary generation - available from web site
. HOMING TROLL - Bridge discovery prototype that feeds dictionary
. Statistical deanonymisation research (MCR)

. NEWTONS CRADLE (JTRIG)

. TRIBAL CARNEM (with CT)

. EPIC FAIL (CT)

. Bulk traffic logging

. QUICK ANT - Low latency deanonymisation. Prototype under evaluation.
. Introducing timing patterns - report available
. Hidden service investigation - report available
. Shaping research - some initial experiments.

. Some extraction of hidden service domain names from passive events.

. Tor implementation analysis (contract task)

Also some work (through contract) on Freenet.

ICTR-NE Goals for 2012/13

Our plans at present are:

•	Tor deanonymisation - collaboration with MCR and JTRIG

•	Tor shaping - with JTRIG

•	Contract: next stage of Tor Implementation Analysis

•	ICTR-CISA: record hidden service hostnames (*.onion) in NATURAL SELECTION.

... so REMATION II fits in well.

Any questions?

•	Maintain knowledge of Tor network - Pullthrough from NE?

•	Log Tor events into HAKIM for target discovery - TR-FSP

•	Build tool to implement low latency attack? - ICTR

•	Collecting traffic at exit nodes to feed passive SIGINT - JTRIG

•	Testing of MCR passive deanonymisation technique. - MCR/JTRIG/ICTR

•	Active injection and detection of timing patterns (probably following test of MCR technique) -
ICTR/JTRIG/MCR

•	Herding of targets through our exit nodes (THEMP) - ICTR/JTRIG

•	Bulk logging of hidden service onion addresses (possibly only those hosting web sites) - experiment carried
out by ICTR

•	Characterisation of hidden web servers by passive analysis - ICTR?

•	Characterisation of hidden web servers by web crawling - ICTR?

•	Identification of IP addresses hosting hidden services - ICTR?

•	Ongoing use/maintenance of TRIBAL CARNEM - CT

•	Find TDIs that appear on Tor and non-tor IP addresses (EPIC FAIL) - CT

•	Understanding Tor circuit creation and destruction - ICTR contract

•	Understanding future developments in Tor - ICTR contract?

•	Spotting private Tor networks - ICTR?

•	TorChat investigation? - ICTR?
