Previous Work/Current Techniques

ICTR-related techniques

. Identification of events by content

. Tor node dictionary generation available from web site

. HOMING TROLL Bridge discovery prototype that feeds dictionary

Statistical deanonymisation research (MCR)

NEWTONS CRADLE (JTRIG)

TRIBAL CARNEM (with CT)

EPIC FAIL (CT)

. Bulk traffic logging

QUICK ANT - Low latency deanonymisation. Prototype under evaluation.
Introducing timing patterns report available

Hidden service investigation report available

Shaping research some initial experiments.

Some extraction of hidden service domain names from passive events.
Tor implementation analysis (contract task)

Also some work (through contract) on Freenet.

Goals for 2012/13

Our plans at present are:

- Tor deanonymisation collaboration with MCR and JTRIG
- Tor shaping with JTRIG
- Contract: next stage of Tor Implementation Analysis

ICTR-CISA: record hidden service hostnames (*.onion) in NATURAL SELECTION.
 so REMATION II fits in well.

Any questions?

Reference: Ideas (201 1)

- Maintain knowledge of Tor network from 

- Log Tor events into HAKIM for target discovery 

- Build tool to implement low latency attack? ICTR

- Collecting traffic at exit nodes to feed passive SIGINT JTRIG

- Testing of MCR passive deanonymisation technique. 

- Active injection and detection of timing patterns (probably following test of MCR technique) 


- Herding of targets through our exit nodes (THEMP) 

- Bulk logging of hidden service onion addresses (possibly only those hosting web sites) experiment carried
out by ICTR

- Characterisation of hidden web servers by passive analysis 

- Characterisation of hidden web servers by web crawling 

- Identification of IP addresses hosting hidden services 

- Ongoing use/maintenance of TRIBAL CARNEM CT

- Find TDIs that appear on Tor and non?tor IP addresses (EPIC FAIL) CT
- Understanding Tor circuit creation and destruction ICTR contract

- Understanding future developments in Tor ICTR contract?

- Spotting private Tor networks 

- TorChat investigation?
