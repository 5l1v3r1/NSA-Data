Who<br>Turned Out the Lights?<br>FROM: Charlie Meals<br>Signals Intelligence Deputy Director<br>Run Date: 05/10/2004<br>FROM: Charlie Meals <br>Signals Intelligence Deputy Director <br>(U//FOUO) When I was asked to contribute a story<br>from my career for this SID today series, the<br>incidents I remembered the best were the ones<br>that were rather comical! One that immediately sprang to mind<br>took place in 1986, when I was NSA's SINIO for Strategic Programs<br>&amp; Arms Control.<br>(U//FOUO) At the time, the U.S. and Soviets had negotiated the<br>Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which was<br>groundbreaking in that it was the first treaty to bring about the<br>complete elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons, and the<br>first-ever agreement which would permit "on-site inspectors" from<br>each country to monitor the other country's compliance. This<br>treaty was highly controversial and deemed extremely important<br>by the Reagan Administration; consequently the oversight for<br>support in stewarding this treaty through the legislative process<br>was extremely tight... nothing would be left to chance and all<br>efforts would be carefully orchestrated.<br>(U//FOUO) Congressional approval was expected to be a significant<br>challenge and the Intelligence Community had the charge of<br>ensuring that compliance could indeed be verified. To assist them<br>in their deliberations leading to a vote on ratification, Congress<br>called for closed-door hearings with the heads of the Intelligence<br>Agencies. The NSA Director, LTG Odom, was summoned, along<br>with the heads of DIA (Lt Gen Perroots), INR (Ambassador<br>Abramowitz), and the DCIA (Judge Webster). General Odom, never<br>one to conform when he had a better idea, made it known that he<br>didn't want to testify, and informed Ralph Adams, NSA's Legislative<br>Affairs Chief, that the SINIO for Strategic Programs &amp; Arms Control<br>(that was me) would go in his place. To make this relatively lowranking bureaucrat acceptable for this forum, the ever-resourceful<br>Mr. Adams decided that I should be given an important-sounding<br>title, and I was subsequently dubbed the "NSA Director for Arms<br>Control."<br>(U//FOUO) It was my job to draft the NSA testimony that would<br>focus in great detail on our ability to monitor compliance with the<br>provisions of the treaty. It was a lengthy and complex statement<br>and when it was done, it was also my job to coordinate and gain<br>approval not only within NSA, but also from the Secretary of<br>Defense. Once I completed the NSA coordination gauntlet I took it<br>to the Pentagon for Secretary Weinberger's approval. I never<br>actually met him, but did cool my heals in his outer office for an<br>extended period of time while he presumably read and approved<br>every detail of the text.<br>(U//FOUO) When the day came to appear before the committee it<br>actually turned out to be a joint session of the Senate Select<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.

I admit to being more than a little nervous - We<br>entered the SSCI secure briefing room, which is aptly called the<br>"Vault" and actually has a huge, bank style vault door and I was<br>even more intimidated. Seated around the room were very famous<br>people I had previously only seen on TV; including John Glenn, Dan<br>Quayle, Sam Nunn, Bill Bradley, David Boren and William Cohen,<br>among others. After I was shown to my seat at the table reserved<br>for testimony, I introduced myself to a very pleasant man seated<br>next to me who identified himself as Bill Webster (also known as<br>the DCI Judge William Webster). After a short exchange of<br>pleasantries and small talk, he introduced me to the other<br>members of his "Team" - the Director of DIA and INR.<br>(U//FOUO) What happened next has almost nothing to do with the<br>proceedings, but was very interesting and humorous. One of the<br>"Team" who will remain unnamed, abruptly and somewhat urgently<br>asked for his briefcase. The entire back row energized and very<br>quickly there was a scuffling noise in the corner and a briefcase<br>appeared, and it was passed hand-to-hand over people's heads<br>until it reached the VIP Team member. I fully expected him to pull<br>some highly sensitive papers out, but instead he took the briefcase<br>placed it on the chair and sat on it, presumably to have a better<br>view of the surroundings from a more lofty perch.<br>(U//FOUO) Next, the CIA Legislative Affairs Officer approached the<br>witness table and announced that there had been a change of plan:<br>Judge Webster would testify, and the rest of us would sit in the<br>back row. When I conveyed the change of plans to the SSCI staff<br>chief, a Mr. George Tenet, he said something like "over my dead<br>body" and quickly put the kibosh on that idea and after a short<br>discussion with the committee Chairman Senator Boren we were<br>quickly back to the original format. As the hearing began, a<br>number of people from NSA were watching the proceedings and<br>observing this august gathering; the joke that dominated the home<br>crowd was "We all recognize Charlie, but who are all those other<br>guys?" Meanwhile, people elsewhere in the Intelligence Community<br>were no doubt wondering who the unknown guy without curly hair<br>was sitting with the three Directors.<br>(U//FOUO) Judge Webster was first to testify and he read his<br>prepared text, which was rather long and some might say factual<br>but dry. Then Chairman Boren announced that the NSA Director for<br>Arms Control would speak. "That's me!" I remembered and as I<br>was about to begin, he said, "Mr. Meals I understand you have<br>some graphics to show us" (In those days NSA was rather famous<br>for always using very polished and elaborate graphics with their<br>presentations). He then instructed the staff to turn out the lights.<br>It was pitch dark in the vault - so dark, in fact, that I couldn't see a<br>word of my written testimony! What to do? I could ask them to<br>turn on the lights... or I could wing it. I decided to wing it.<br>(U//FOUO) The graphics appeared on the screen, and as if by<br>magic, words came out of my mouth describing the details behind<br>what everyone was seeing. I spoke completely off the cuff and to<br>my surprise, the Senators became very engaged and showed a<br>great deal of interest in how SIGINT would play in all of this. After I<br>finished the brief, there were a number of questions and comments<br>and to be honest, I must admit my initial anxiety had disappeared<br>and I was enjoying my "time on stage". While it appeared that my<br>extemporaneous remarks were well received, it also occurred to<br>me, that I might not have been totally precise in terms of the very<br>specific testimony I had approved by Secretary Weinberger. It was<br><br>12.  In SID er's View of<br>History : Quite a<br>Welcome!<br>13.  In SID er's View of<br>History : The<br>Adventure Continues<br>-- Evacuation from<br>Belgrade<br><br> </p>at this point the cold sweat returned and I knew I could be in real<br>hot water. Fortunately for me, George Tenet came up to<br>congratulate me for presentation and I confided to him that I was<br>only "paraphrasing" my testimony and the recording would not<br>match what the SECDEF had approved. Coming to my rescue he<br>told me to relax and that he would simply submit a copy of the<br>written testimony for the record and I wouldn't get fired after all.<br>(U) I'm not sure that there's any real moral to this story, but I did<br>learn one important lesson: never bring slides along when<br>testifying before a closed session to Congress!<br>(U) ...and the rest of the story! The INF treaty was ratified, in no<br>small part because of the high level of confidence in verification<br>(i.e. intelligence). In the end this resulted in the destruction of an<br>entire class of nuclear weapons systems that were perceived by<br>both the Soviets and NATO as being extremely dangerous and a<br>hair trigger in many respect - all in all a good ending.<br>(U//FOUO) See other editions of InSIDer's View of History :<br>A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br>How a Four Star General Once Waited for a Lowly Captain to<br>Finish Eating Lunch<br>In SHAPE, In France<br>"Soviet Rocket" Strikes Chicksands<br>Onboard Air Force 2 Bound for Moscow<br>(U//FOUO) Do YOU have a story to tell?
