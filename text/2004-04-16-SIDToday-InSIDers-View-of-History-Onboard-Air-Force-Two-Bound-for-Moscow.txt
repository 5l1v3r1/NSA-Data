The year was 1982, and the long-time leader of the Soviet<br>Union, Leonid Brezhnev, had just died. At the time I was the chief<br>of the Domestic Politics Division in the CIA's Office of Soviet<br>Analysis, so suddenly my area of expertise was the hottest topic.<br>(U//FOUO) President Reagan asked his Vice President, George<br>H.W. Bush, to represent the U.S. at Brezhnev's funeral. V.P. Bush<br>was traveling in Africa at the time, so plans were quickly made to<br>fly him to the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport in Germany, and from<br>there proceed to Moscow. Meanwhile, Bob Gates, the CIA's Deputy<br>Director of Intelligence, wanted to provide the V.P. with a highly<br>classified intelligence report about the new Soviet leader, Yuri<br>Andropov. I was tapped to deliver the document to V.P. Bush and<br>answer any questions that he might have.<br>(C) A CIA courier and I hurried off to Frankfurt with the document<br>in hand. We stored the paper overnight at a secure facility in the<br>area and waited for the V.P.'s arrival the following day. On my own<br>initiative, I decided that I wanted to be on that plane to Moscow. I<br>took a few pieces of clothing from my suitcase and stashed them in<br>my briefcase on the outside chance that I would be allowed to<br>make the trip. Sure enough, my offer to accompany the V.P.'s<br>group to Moscow was accepted, and my briefcase and I were on<br>our way.<br>(U//FOUO) When I joined the CIA, I never imagined that some day<br>I'd be flying to Moscow on Air Force Two, briefing the Vice<br>President. But this is exactly what happened. I briefed Mr. Bush on<br>the contents of the report and we spent most of the remainder of<br>the flight discussing Soviet affairs. It was a non-stop session, and<br>he asked many questions. By the way, Mr. Bush was a very easy<br>person to talk to; he was serious, but he had a good sense of<br>humor and a down-to-earth manner.<br>(C) When we arrived in Moscow, I had to find somewhere to put<br>the classified report. Although the main U.S. Embassy facilities<br>were closed, I managed to secure the document at the "commo"<br>room (24-hr communications facility). I happened to run into an<br>acquaintance at the Embassy, and he found a place for me to stay.<br>(I had been in Moscow twice before, in 1976 and 1981, so I knew<br>some of the people there.)<br>(U//FOUO) The next day, we watched the funeral on television<br>from the Embassy. I provided a running commentary for the State<br>Department folks who had been in Africa and explained who was<br>who, since the Soviet Union was not their area of expertise.

The next day, we flew back to<br>Washington.<br>(U//FOUO) Naturally, when I got back to work at the CIA, many<br>people wanted me to brief them about what happened. As I was<br>talking to DDI Gates, I learned that the Chief of Station (COS) in<br>Moscow was quote "livid" that I had arrived unexpectedly in<br>Moscow, and had asked what "idiot" let me go. In response, Gates<br>told the COS, " I am that idiot!" I don't think we heard any further<br>complaints from the COS on the subject.<br><br>12.

In SID er's View of<br>History : The<br>Adventure Continues<br>-- Evacuation from<br>Belgrade<br><br>(U//FOUO) This experience opened up all kinds of doors for me.<br>Since I was a known quantity, I was asked to go to Moscow in 1984<br>and 1985 for the funerals of Andropov and Chernenko. (There was<br>a lot of turnover there until the relatively young Gorbachev took<br>over.) I was asked to brief Mr. Bush on three other occasions, at<br>both the Vice President's official residence at the Naval<br>Observatory and at Camp David after he had been elected<br>President. At Camp David, the President had all of his senior<br>advisors in attendance, including Condoleezza Rice, and I was part<br>of a 4-person CIA group briefing him on Soviet affairs in<br>preparation for his summit with Gorbachev in Malta.<br>(U//FOUO) It goes without saying that to be successful in your<br>career, you must know your business. But some luck certainly<br>doesn't hurt! There were others who could have briefed the Vice<br>President on Soviet affairs, but I was in the right place at the right<br>time. I suppose the moral of the story is that when you have an<br>opportunity, you have to seize it... and then you just hope it all<br>works out ok.<br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: There is a photo on<br>Mr. Blackwell's wall taken during V.P. Bush's flight to Moscow on<br>Air Force Two in 1982. The Vice President wrote on the picture,<br>"They die, we fly," which became an insider's joke on later trips Mr.<br>Blackwell made with the Vice President for funereal visits to the<br>Soviet Union.<br>(U//FOUO) See other editions of InSIDer's View of History :<br>A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br>How a Four Star General Once Waited for a Lowly Captain to<br>Finish Eating Lunch<br>In SHAPE, In France<br>"Soviet Rocket" Strikes Chicksands<br>(U//FOUO) Do YOU have a story to tell?
