ACCESS:
THE VISION

SECRET

In 2013, we will have access to, and make readily available, data of the highest value possible
to facilitate cyber operations and to enable IA, Effects and SIGINT. We remain committed to
the principles of the Tordella doctrine and will be delivering dynamic and responsive access
services to meet fast-changing customer requirements, providing a global reach through our
assets in Cheltenham and at Extended Enterprise locations, and through multi-partner
collaboration, shaping, and special relationships with industry.

We will be using the world’s biggest SIGINT engine to run cyber operations and to access
better, more valued data for customers to make a real world difference. We will have exploited
to the full our unique selling points of geography, partnerships, the UK’s legal regime and our
skilled workforce. We will have used our optimised SIGINT engine to support IA and Effects

operations globally.

As well as accessing events and content, we will have expanded our capabilities and abilities
to perform CNE exfiltration, eAD, beaconry and geo-location, as well as gathering
environmental information and various forms of ‘Internet Pocket Litter’ (e.g. cookies, delete
keys). These new capabilities and forms of data have the potential to become our most highly

valued and prized data.
