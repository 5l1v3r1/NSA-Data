INT Summary:

Obj DOODY is a mid level commander who operates
in both and MJH. He maintains links to Obj
KOJAK from whom he receives direction and Obj
STILTSKIN with whom he is assessed to discuss
commission matters, particularly TB dispute resolution
by lethal means. Obj DOODY is active in planning
attacks on CF and NDA DCC. He also directs
subordinates to conduct attacks and facilitates the
supply of heavy weapons and ammunition. Obj

DOO DY is a new commander who has been given the
responsibility for Saidebad by Obj KOJAK.

Expectation:

The removal of Obj DOO DY will deny the INS within
and MJH of a competent commander linked
into the HMD Military Commission. The networks
within this area are suffering as a result of recent
targeting and BG operations. Denying the INS this
commander will further impact on the INS ability to
conduct attacks against CF and ANSF and the
resupply of weapons.

What Happened?

- Full details of the incident are contained in the TFH Dynamic Target Storyboard TFH J3 Targets Op STEN TAKAY Obj DOODY Mullah Niaz
Muhammed IS3673 (slide 1).

Report of CIVCAS

- At 071134D*Feb11 Ground ClS?s from arrived on the site of the strike and discovered 2 FAM WIA and delivered immediate first aid and arranged for
them the be evacuated as INS under escortto BSN R3 hospital on at 1144hrs. The casualties are detailed below:

- Casualty 1 - FAM. Believed to be Obj DOODY. Assessed at Cat A. Injuries caused by 30mm AH strike, resulting intestine and head injuries. Drifting
inlout of conscious. Radial pulse-present.

- Casualty 2 FAM. Assessed at Cat B. Injuries from shrapnel. Wounds to right arm and face, he is conscious.

- Subsequently the body of a LN Male Child with fragmentation wounds was discovered in compound CE10-32 (Gr 41R PO 17897 92491). The body was
quickly claimed by a LN family member and removed for burial.

- Casualty 1 (believed to be Obj DOODY) was subsequently transferred to KAF to receive treatment for his head wound on with an escort.
Assessment

- The CIVCAS are believed to be the result of the following chain of events. This is only a preliminary assessment and further investigations will bring more
detail. This assessment may contain errors due to the time constraints involved.

- Initially correctly targeting Obj DOODY 1 INS the AH launched it attack run but could not engage.
- The AH then circled around for a 2nd run on the 2 INS, possibly losing PID.

- The AH then mistakenly targeted 2 civilians in the same engagement with a Hellfire miss, realising they were not the intended tgt, he continued on
and engaged the INS PID as Obj DOODY with 30mm.

3. Obj DOODY AH Strike 1 LN Child KIA 1 Cat 

What Have We Done About It?

 

- At 1210hrs the DG was informed of the incident it was reported that ?he understands that we try to negate CIVCAS but accepted we needed to 'kill or wound


- At 1325hrs the IAT was activated to investigate this incident. It will include a representative from the office.
- A National Investigation (Shooting Incident Report) has been instigated into this incident.

- Infl and media have been informed.

What are we going to do about it?

- CF will continue to investigate the incident on the ground speaking with LNs to gain a greater understanding of the incident and its likely effects. They
will also attempt to locate family members for future compensation payments.

- Casualty 2 in BSN will be re-classified as an LN and interviewed by the BSN CIFT team to gain further information. His details will also be recorded for future
compensation payments.

- Casualty 1 in KAF will be processed in the normal manner for a suspected high value target.

TFH initial Assessment

- The TFH initial assessment is that the 2 CIVCAS was caused by ISAF troops. The exact reasons why this occurred will be investigated in detail but initially
appear to be a loss of PID, on repositioning of the Aircraft by the AH crew.
