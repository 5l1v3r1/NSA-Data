Expressing the appreciation of all SID personnel who have deployed and<br>those who will, MG Quirk said, "We greatly appreciate how you applied your training and skills<br>and often visited the "Red Zone" to provide security while our people were conducting<br>operations and carrying out mission requirements. Every minute in the "Red Zone" exposed you<br>to danger, yet you went with our people to allow them to be more focused on mission. In every<br>sense of the phrase...you had our backs! Your efforts took mission security to an unequaled high<br>and for that we are very grateful."<br>(U//FOUO) When NSA employees first began deploying to Iraq the arrangements made for their<br>security were nothing close to what they are today, thanks to Lieutenant Futrel Jackson,<br>Sergeant Wayne Weitkamp, Sergeant Anthony Cavell, and Officer <br> members of the<br>NSA Police Emergency Response Team. In February of 2004, these men deployed for sixty days<br>to Baghdad to protect NSA personnel, mission activities and operational elements, engaged in<br>supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom.<br>(U) The Emergency Response Team was selected for this mission based on their individual skills<br>with weapons and tactics, decisive coordinated teamwork, and the requirements dictated by a<br>hostile war-stricken environment. Providing armed force protection and expert security support<br>to Agency personnel and mission elements engaged in sensitive operations, the ERT regularly<br>encountered dangerous, hazardous conditions, and were exposed to mortar fire and general<br>lawlessness.<br>(U) In addition to providing security for the short-term, the NSA Security organization arranged<br>for long-term contractor teams to provide the same support. They handled the logistics, showed<br>the contractors the ropes, and introduced them to the right people making it possible for the<br>protection of SID employees to continue at the same high level.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
