On this occasion, we'd like to invite all of the SID employees to come to the<br>SID Holiday Open House -- those we know and those we have yet to meet, those who have been<br>here for years and those who are brand new to the SID community. So mark your calendars for<br>14 December, 2W106, from 1130-1330 . We really look forward to seeing all of you.<br>(U) Our best to you and yours during this holiday season,<br>MG Richard Quirk, Signals Intelligence Director <br>Charlie Meals, Signals Intelligence Deputy Director <br>Karyn Vice, SID Chief of Staff<br>. <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
