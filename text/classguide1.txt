(U) This classification guide describes the SIGINT material that is dated from 16 August
1945 - 31 December 1967 and warrants protection for more than 50 years. It supersedes
all prior guidance relating to material originating during this timeframe. This guidance
pertains to NSA/CSS as urcll as to its predecessor organizations.

Conversely, if information that NSA/CSS has relating to these countries that is outside the scope of the partnerships were to be released, the countries could gain insight into NSA’s other SIGINT capabilities, and could also become aware of information that NSA/CSS has not been sharing. The future of NSA/CSS’s Third Party SIGINT foreign partnerships would be at stake.

If NSA/CSS were to release information that revealed the equities of its foreign partners (Second as well as Third Parties), the future of its SIGINT foreign partnerships would be at stake.

This would deprive the U.
