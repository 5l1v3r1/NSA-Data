agreement as a result of US National Security Agency surveillance1,

-	having regard to its resolution of 10 December 2013 on unleashing the potential of
cloud computing2,

-	having regard to the interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and
the Council concerning the forwarding to and handling by the European Parliament of
classified information held by the Council on matters other than those in the area of
the common foreign and security policy3,

-	having regard to Annex VIII of its Rules of Procedure,

-	having regard to Rule 48 of its Rules of Procedure,

-	having regard to the report of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home
Affairs (A70000/2013),

The impact of mass surveillance

A.	whereas the ties between Europe and the United States of America are based on the
spirit and principles of democracy, liberty, justice and solidarity;

B.	whereas mutual trust and understanding are key factors in the transatlantic dialogue;

C.	whereas in September 2001 the world entered a new phase which resulted in the fight
against terrorism being listed among the top priorities of most governments; whereas
the revelations based on leaked documents from Edward Snowden, former NSA
contractor, put democratically elected leaders under an obligation to address the
challenges of the increasing capabilities of intelligence agencies in surveillance
activities and their implications for the rule of law in a democratic society;

D.	whereas the revelations since June 2013 have caused numerous concerns within the
EU as to:

•	the extent of the surveillance systems revealed both in the US and in EU
Member States;

•	the high risk of violation of EU legal standards, fundamental rights and data
protection standards;

•	the degree of trust between EU and US transatlantic partners;

•	the degree of cooperation and involvement of certain EU Member States with
US surveillance programmes or equivalent programmes at national level as
unveiled by the media;

•	the degree of control and effective oversight by the US political authorities and
certain EU Member States over their intelligence communities;

PR\1014703EN.doc	7/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

•	the possibility of these mass surveillance operations being used for reasons
other than national security and the strict fight against terrorism, for example
economic and industrial espionage or profiling on political grounds;

•	the respective roles and degree of involvement of intelligence agencies and
private IT and telecom companies;

•	the increasingly blurred boundaries between law enforcement and intelligence
activities, leading to every citizen being treated as a suspect;

•	the threats to privacy in a digital era;

E.	whereas the unprecedented magnitude of the espionage revealed requires full
investigation by the US authorities, the European Institutions and Members States’
governments and national parliaments;

F.	whereas the US authorities have denied some of the information revealed but not
contested the vast majority of it; whereas the public debate has developed on a large
scale in the US and in a limited number of EU Member States; whereas EU
governments too often remain silent and fail to launch adequate investigations;

G.	whereas it is the duty of the European Institutions to ensure that EU law is fully
implemented for the benefit of European citizens and that the legal force of EU
Treaties is not undermined by a dismissive acceptance of extraterritorial effects of
third countries’ standards or actions;

Developments in the US on reform of intelligence

H.	whereas the District Court for the District of Columbia, in its Decision of 16
December 2013, has ruled that the bulk collection of metadata by the NSA is in breach
of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution1;

I.	whereas a Decision of the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan has ruled
that the Fourth Amendment requires reasonableness in all searches, prior warrants for
any reasonable search, warrants based upon prior-existing probable cause, as well as
particularity as to persons, place and things and the interposition of a neutral
magistrate between Executive branch enforcement officers and citizens2;

J.	whereas in its report of 12 December 2013, the President’s Review Group on
Intelligence and Communication Technology proposes 45 recommendations to the
President of the US; whereas the recommendations stress the need simultaneously to
protect national security and personal privacy and civil liberties; whereas in this regard
it invites the US Government to end bulk collection of phone records of US persons
under Section 215 of the Patriot Act as soon as practicable, to undertake a thorough
review of the NSA and the US intelligence legal framework in order to ensure respect
for the right to privacy, to end efforts to subvert or make vulnerable commercial
software (backdoors and malware), to increase the use of encryption, particularly in 1 2

the case of data in transit, and not to undermine efforts to create encryption standards,
to create a Public Interest Advocate to represent privacy and civil liberties before the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to confer on the Privacy and Civil Liberties
Oversight Board the power to oversee Intelligence Community activities for foreign
intelligence purposes, and not only for counterterrorism purposes, and to receive
whistleblowers’ complaints, to use Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties to obtain
electronic communications, and not to use surveillance to steal industry or trade
secrets;

K.	whereas in respect of intelligence activities about non-US persons under Section 702
of FISA, the Recommendations to the President of the USA recognise the fundamental
issue of respect for privacy and human dignity enshrined in Article 12 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights; whereas they do not recommend granting non-US persons the
same rights and protections as US persons;

Legal framework

Fundamental rights

L.	whereas the report on the findings by the EU Co-Chairs of the ad hoc EU-US Working
Group on data protection provides for an overview of the legal situation in the US but
has not helped sufficiently with establishing the facts about US surveillance
programmes; whereas no information has been made available about the so-called
‘second track’ Working Group, under which Member States discuss bilaterally with
the US authorities matters related to national security;

M.	whereas fundamental rights, notably freedom of expression, of the press, of thought,
of conscience, of religion and of association, private life, data protection, as well as
the right to an effective remedy, the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair
trial and non-discrimination, as enshrined in the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and in the European Convention on Human Rights, are cornerstones
of democracy;

Union competences in the field of security

N.	whereas according to Article 67(3) TFEU the EU ‘shall endeavour to ensure a high
level of security’; whereas the provisions of the Treaty (in particular Article 4(2) TEU,
Article 72 TFEU and Article 73 TFEU) imply that the EU disposes of certain
competences on matters relating to the collective security of the Union; whereas the
EU has exercised competence in matters of internal security by deciding on a number
of legislative instruments and concluding international agreements (PNR, TFTP)
aimed at fighting serious crime and terrorism and by setting up an internal security
strategy and agencies working in this field;

O.	whereas the concepts of ‘national security’, ‘internal security’, ‘internal security of the
EU’ and ‘international security’ overlap; whereas the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties, the principle of sincere cooperation among EU Member States and the
human rights law principle of interpreting any exemptions narrowly point towards a

PR\1014703EN.doc	9/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

restrictive interpretation of the notion of ‘national security’ and require that Member
States refrain from encroaching upon EU competences;

P.	whereas, under the ECHR, Member States’ agencies and even private parties acting in
the field of national security also have to respect the rights enshrined therein, be they
of their own citizens or of citizens of other States; whereas this also goes for
cooperation with other States’ authorities in the field of national security;

Extra-territoriality

Q.	whereas the extra-territorial application by a third country of its laws, regulations and
other legislative or executive instruments in situations falling under the jurisdiction of
the EU or its Member States may impact on the established legal order and the rule of
law, or even violate international or EU law, including the rights of natural and legal
persons, taking into account the extent and the declared or actual aim of such an
application; whereas, in these exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to take action
at the EU level to ensure that the rule of law, and the rights of natural and legal
persons are respected within the EU, in particular by removing, neutralising, blocking
or otherwise countering the effects of the foreign legislation concerned;

International transfers of data

R.	whereas the transfer of personal data by EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies or
by the Member States to the US for law enforcement purposes in the absence of
adequate safeguards and protections for the respect of fundamental rights of EU
citizens, in particular the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data, would
make that EU institution, body, office or agency or that Member State liable, under
Article 340 TFEU or the established case law of the CJEU1, for breach of EU law -
which includes any violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in the EU Charter;

Transfers to the US based on the US Safe Harbour

S.	whereas the US data protection legal framework does not ensure an adequate level of
protection for EU citizens;

T.	whereas, in order to enable EU data controllers to transfer personal data to an entity in
the US, the Commission, in its Decision 520/2000, has declared the adequacy of the
protection provided by the Safe Harbour privacy principles and the related FAQs
issued by the US Department of Commerce for personal data transferred from the
Union to organisations established in the United States that have joined the Safe
Harbour;

U.	whereas in its resolution of 5 July 2000 the European Parliament expressed doubts and
concerns as to the adequacy of the Safe Harbour and called on the Commission to
review the decision in good time in the light of experience and of any legislative
developments;

1 See notably Joined Cases C-6/90 and C-9/90, Francovich and others v. Italy, judgment of 28 May 1991.
PE526.085v02-00	10/52	PR\1014703EN.doc

EN

V.	whereas Commission Decision 520/2000 stipulates that the competent authorities in
Member States may exercise their existing powers to suspend data flows to an
organisation that has self-certified its adherence to the Safe Harbour principles, in
order to protect individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data in
cases where there is a substantial likelihood that the Safe Harbour principles are being
violated or that the continuing transfer would create an imminent risk of grave harm to
data subjects;

W.	whereas Commission Decision 520/2000 also states that when evidence has been
provided that anybody responsible for ensuring compliance with the principles is not
effectively fulfilling their role, the Commission must inform the US Department of
Commerce and, if necessary, present measures with a view to reversing or suspending
the said Decision or limiting its scope;

X.	whereas in its first two reports on the implementation of the Safe Harbour, of 2002
and 2004, the Commission identified several deficiencies as regards the proper
implementation of the Safe Harbour and made several recommendations to the US
authorities with a view to rectifying them;

Y.	whereas in its third implementation report, of 27 November 2013, nine years after the
second report and without any of the deficiencies recognised in that report having been
rectified, the Commission identified further wide-ranging weaknesses and
shortcomings in the Safe Harbour and concluded that the current implementation
could not be maintained; whereas the Commission has stressed that wide-ranging
access by US intelligence agencies to data transferred to the US by
Safe-Harbour-certified entities raises additional serious questions as to the continuity
of protection of the data of EU data subjects; whereas the Commission addressed 13
recommendations to the US authorities and undertook to identify by summer 2014,
together with the US authorities, remedies to be implemented as soon as possible,
forming the basis for a full review of the functioning of the Safe Harbour principles;

Z.	whereas on 28-31 October 2013 the delegation of the European Parliament’s
Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE Committee) to
Washington D.C. met with the US Department of Commerce and the US Federal
Trade Commission; whereas the Department of Commerce acknowledged the
existence of organisations having self-certified adherence to Safe Harbour Principles
but clearly showing a ‘not-current status’, meaning that the company does not fulfil
Safe Harbour requirements although continuing to receive personal data from the EU;
whereas the Federal Trade Commission admitted that the Safe Harbour should be
reviewed in order to improve it, particularly with regard to complaints and alternative
dispute resolution systems;

AA.	whereas Safe Harbour Principles may be limited ‘to the extent necessary to meet
national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements’; whereas, as an
exception to a fundamental right, such an exception must always be interpreted
restrictively and be limited to what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic
society, and the law must clearly establish the conditions and safeguards to make this
limitation legitimate; whereas such an exception should not be used in a way that

PR\1014703EN.doc

11/52

PE526.085v02-00

EN

undermines the protection afforded by EU data protection law and the Safe Harbour
principles;

AB.	whereas large-scale access by US intelligence agencies has seriously eroded
transatlantic trust and negatively impacted on the trust for US organisations acting in
the EU; whereas this is further exacerbated by the lack of judicial and administrative
redress for EU citizens under US law, particularly in cases of surveillance activities
for intelligence purposes;

Transfers to third countries with the adequacy decision

AC.	whereas according to the information revealed and to the findings of the inquiry
conducted by the LIBE Committee, the national security agencies of New Zealand and
Canada have been involved on a large scale in mass surveillance of electronic
communications and have actively cooperated with the US under the so called ‘Five
eyes’ programme, and may have exchanged with each other personal data of EU
citizens transferred from the EU;

AD.	whereas Commission Decisions 2013/651 and 2/2002 of 20 December 20012 have
declared the adequate level of protection ensured by the New Zealand and the
Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act; whereas the
aforementioned revelations also seriously affect trust in the legal systems of these
countries as regards the continuity of protection afforded to EU citizens; whereas the
Commission has not examined this aspect;

Transfers based on contractual clauses and other instruments

AE.	whereas Directive 95/46/EC provides that international transfers to a third country
may also take place by means of specific instruments whereby the controller adduces
adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental
rights and freedoms of individuals and as regards the exercise of the corresponding
rights;

AF.	whereas such safeguards may in particular result from appropriate contractual clauses;

AG.	whereas Directive 95/46/EC empowers the Commission to decide that specific
standard contractual clauses offer sufficient safeguards required by the Directive and
whereas on this basis the Commission has adopted three models of standard
contractual clauses for transfers to controllers and processors (and sub-processors) in
third countries;

AH.	whereas the Commission Decisions establishing the standard contractual clauses
stipulate that the competent authorities in Member States may exercise their existing
powers to suspend data flows when it is established that the law to which the data
importer or a sub-processor is subject imposes upon them requirements to derogate
from the applicable data protection law which go beyond the restrictions necessary in

2	OJ L 2, 4.1.2002, p. 13.

a democratic society as provided for in Article 13 of Directive 95/46/EC, where those
requirements are likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided
by the applicable data protection law and the standard contractual clauses, or where
there is a substantial likelihood that the standard contractual clauses in the annex are
not being or will not be complied with and the continuing transfer would create an
imminent risk of grave harm to the data subjects;

AI.	whereas national data protection authorities have developed binding corporate rules
(BCRs) in order to facilitate international transfers within a multinational corporation
with adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental
rights and freedoms of individuals and as regards the exercise of the corresponding
rights; whereas before being used, BCRs need to be authorised by the Member States’
competent authorities after the latter have assessed compliance with Union data
protection law;

Transfers based on TFTP and PNR agreements

AJ.	whereas in its resolution of 23 October 2013 the European Parliament expressed
serious concerns about the revelations concerning the NSA’s activities as regards
direct access to financial payments messages and related data, which would constitute
a clear breach of the Agreement, in particular Article 1 thereof;

AK.	whereas the European Parliament asked the Commission to suspend the Agreement
and requested that all relevant information and documents be made available
immediately for Parliament’s deliberations;

AL.	whereas following the allegations published by the media, the Commission decided to
open consultations with the US pursuant to Article 19 of the TFTP Agreement;
whereas on 27 November 2013 Commissioner Malmstrom informed the LIBE
Committee that, after meeting US authorities and in view of the replies given by the
US authorities in their letters and during their meetings, the Commission had decided
not to pursue the consultations on the grounds that there were no elements showing
that the US Government has acted in a manner contrary to the provisions of the
Agreement, and that the US has provided written assurance that no direct data
collection has taken place contrary to the provisions of the TFTP agreement;

AM.	whereas during the LIBE delegation to Washington of 28-31 October 2013 the
delegation met with the US Department of the Treasury; whereas the US Treasury
stated that since the entry into force of the TFTP Agreement it had not had access to
data from SWIFT in the EU except within the framework of the TFTP; whereas the
US Treasury refused to comment on whether SWIFT data would have been accessed
outside TFTP by any other US government body or department or whether the US
administration was aware of NSA mass surveillance activities; whereas on

18 December 2013 Mr Glenn Greenwald stated before the LIBE Committee inquiry
that the NSA and GCHQ had targeted SWIFT networks;

AN.	whereas the Belgian and Dutch Data Protection authorities decided on 13 November
2013 to conduct a joint investigation into the security of SWIFT’s payment networks
in order to ascertain whether third parties could gain unauthorised or unlawful access

EN

to European citizens’ bank data1;

AO.	whereas according to the Joint Review of the EU-US PNR agreement, the United
States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) made 23 disclosures of PNR data to
the NSA on a case-by-case basis in support of counterterrorism cases, in a manner
consistent with the specific terms of the Agreement;

AP.	whereas the Joint Review fails to mention the fact that in the case of processing of
personal data for intelligence purposes, under US law, non-US citizens do not enjoy
any judicial or administrative avenue to protect their rights, and constitutional
protections are only granted to US persons; whereas this lack of judicial or
administrative rights nullifies the protections for EU citizens laid down in the existing
PNR agreement;

Transfers based on the EU-US Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement in criminal matters

AQ.	whereas the EU-US Agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters of
6 June 20032 entered into force on 1 February 2010 and is intended to facilitate
cooperation between the EU and US to combat crime in a more effective way, having
due regard for the rights of individuals and the rule of law;

Framework agreement on data protection in the field of police and judicial cooperation

(‘umbrella agreement ’)

AR.	whereas the purpose of this general agreement is to establish the legal framework for
all transfers of personal data between the EU and US for the sole purposes of
preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offences, including
terrorism, in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters;
whereas negotiations were authorised by the Council on 2 December 2010;

AS.	whereas this agreement should provide for clear and precise legally binding
data-processing principles and should in particular recognise EU citizens’ right to
access, rectification and erasure of their personal data in the US, as well as the right to
an efficient administrative and judicial redress mechanism for EU citizens and
independent oversight of the data-processing activities;

AT.	whereas in its Communication of 27 November 2013 the Commission indicated that
the ‘umbrella agreement’ should result in a high level of protection for citizens on both
sides of the Atlantic and should strengthen the trust of Europeans in EU-US data
exchanges, providing a basis on which to develop EU-US security cooperation and
partnership further;

AU.	whereas negotiations on the agreement have not progressed because of the US
Government’s persistent position of refusing recognition of effective rights of
administrative and judicial redress to EU citizens and because of the intention of
providing broad derogations to the data protection principles contained in the

agreement, such as purpose limitation, data retention or onward transfers either
domestically or abroad;

Data Protection Reform

AV.	whereas the EU data protection legal framework is currently being reviewed in order
to establish a comprehensive, consistent, modern and robust system for all data-
processing activities in the Union; whereas in January 2012 the Commission presented
a package of legislative proposals: a General Data Protection Regulation1, which will
replace Directive 95/46/EC and establish a uniform law throughout the EU, and a
Directive2 which will lay down a harmonised framework for all data processing
activities by law enforcement authorities for law enforcement purposes and will
reduce the current divergences among national laws;

AW.	whereas on 21 October 2013 the LIBE Committee adopted its legislative reports on
the two proposals and a decision on the opening of negotiations with the Council with
a view to having the legal instruments adopted during this legislative term;

AX.	whereas, although the European Council of 24/25 October 2013 called for the timely
adoption of a strong EU General Data Protection framework in order to foster the trust
of citizens and businesses in the digital economy, the Council has been unable to
arrive at a general approach on the General Data Protection Regulation and the
Directive3;

IT security and cloud computing

AY.	whereas the resolution of 10 December4 emphasises the economic potential of ‘cloud
computing’ business for growth and employment;

AZ.	whereas the level of data protection in a cloud computing environment must not be
inferior to that required in any other data-processing context; whereas Union data
protection law, since it is technologically neutral, already applies fully to cloud
computing services operating in the EU;

BA. whereas mass surveillance activities give intelligence agencies access to personal data
stored by EU individuals under cloud services agreements with major US cloud
providers; whereas the US intelligence authorities have accessed personal data stored
in servers located on EU soil by tapping into the internal networks of Yahoo and
Google5; whereas such activities constitute a violation of international obligations;
whereas it is not excluded that information stored in cloud services by Member States’
public authorities or undertakings and institutions has also been accessed by
intelligence authorities;

BB.	whereas intelligence services perform an important function in protecting democratic
society against internal and external threats; whereas they are given special powers
and capabilities to this end; whereas these powers are to be used within the rule of law,
as otherwise they risk losing legitimacy and eroding the democratic nature of society;

BC.	whereas the high level of secrecy that is intrinsic to the intelligence services in order to
avoid endangering ongoing operations, revealing modi operandi or putting at risk the
lives of agents impedes full transparency, public scrutiny and normal democratic or
judicial examination;

BD.	whereas technological developments have led to increased international intelligence
cooperation, also involving the exchange of personal data, and often blurring the line
between intelligence and law enforcement activities;

BE.	whereas most of existing national oversight mechanisms and bodies were set up or
revamped in the 1990s and have not necessarily been adapted to the rapid
technological developments over the last decade;

BF.	whereas democratic oversight of intelligence activities is still conducted at national
level, despite the increase in exchange of information between EU Member States and
between Member States and third countries; whereas there is an increasing gap
between the level of international cooperation on the one hand and oversight capacities
limited to the national level on the other, which results in insufficient and ineffective
democratic scrutiny;

Main findings

1.	Considers that recent revelations in the press by whistleblowers and journalists,
together with the expert evidence given during this inquiry, have resulted in
compelling evidence of the existence of far-reaching, complex and highly
technologically advanced systems designed by US and some Member States’
intelligence services to collect, store and analyse communication and location data and
metadata of all citizens around the world on an unprecedented scale and in an
indiscriminate and non-suspicion-based manner;

2.	Points specifically to US NSA intelligence programmes allowing for the mass
surveillance of EU citizens through direct access to the central servers of leading US
internet companies (PRISM programme), the analysis of content and metadata
(Xkeyscore programme), the circumvention of online encryption (BULLRUN), access
to computer and telephone networks and access to location data, as well as to systems
of the UK intelligence agency GCHQ such as its upstream surveillance activity
(Tempora programme) and decryption programme (Edgehill); believes that the
existence of programmes of a similar nature, even if on a more limited scale, is likely
in other EU countries such as France (DGSE), Germany (BND) and Sweden (FRA); 3

3.	Notes the allegations of ‘hacking’ or tapping into the Belgacom systems by the UK
intelligence agency GCHQ; reiterates the indication by Belgacom that it could not
confirm that EU institutions were targeted or affected, and that the malware used was
extremely complex and required the use of extensive financial and staffing resources

PE526.085v02-00	16/52	PR\1014703EN.doc

EN

for its development and use that would not be available to private entities or hackers;

4.	States that trust has been profoundly shaken: trust between the two transatlantic
partners, trust among EU Member States, trust between citizens and their
governments, trust in the respect of the rule of law, and trust in the security of IT
services; believes that in order to rebuild trust in all these dimensions a comprehensive
plan is urgently needed;

5.	Notes that several governments claim that these mass surveillance programmes are
necessary to combat terrorism; wholeheartedly supports the fight against terrorism, but
strongly believes that it can never in itself be a justification for untargeted, secret and
sometimes even illegal mass surveillance programmes; expresses concerns, therefore,
regarding the legality, necessity and proportionality of these programmes;

6.	Considers it very doubtful that data collection of such magnitude is only guided by the
fight against terrorism, as it involves the collection of all possible data of all citizens;
points therefore to the possible existence of other power motives such as political and
economic espionage;

7.	Questions the compatibility of some Member States’ massive economic espionage
activities with the EU internal market and competition law as enshrined in Title I and
Title VII of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; reaffirms the
principle of sincere cooperation as enshrined in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Treaty on
European Union and the principle that the Member States shall ‘refrain from any
measures which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union’s objectives’;

8.	Notes that international treaties and EU and US legislation, as well as national
oversight mechanisms, have failed to provide for the necessary checks and balances
and for democratic accountability;

9.	Condemns in the strongest possible terms the vast, systemic, blanket collection of the
personal data of innocent people, often comprising intimate personal information;
emphasises that the systems of mass, indiscriminate surveillance by intelligence
services constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of citizens;
stresses that privacy is not a luxury right, but that it is the foundation stone of a free
and democratic society; points out, furthermore, that mass surveillance has potentially
severe effects on the freedom of the press, thought and speech, as well as a significant
potential for abuse of the information gathered against political adversaries;
emphasises that these mass surveillance activities appear also to entail illegal actions
by intelligence services and raise questions regarding the extra-territoriality of national
laws;

10.	Sees the surveillance programmes as yet another step towards the establishment of a
fully fledged preventive state, changing the established paradigm of criminal law in
democratic societies, promoting instead a mix of law enforcement and intelligence
activities with blurred legal safeguards, often not in line with democratic checks and
balances and fundamental rights, especially the presumption of innocence; recalls in

PR\1014703EN.doc

that regard the decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court1 on the prohibition
of the use of preventive dragnets (‘präventive Rasterfahndung’) unless there is proof
of a concrete danger to other high-ranking legally protected rights, whereby a general
threat situation or international tensions do not suffice to justify such measures;

11.	Is adamant that secret laws, treaties and courts violate the rule of law; points out that
any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of
a non-EU state authorising, directly or indirectly, surveillance activities such as those
examined by this inquiry may not be automatically recognised or enforced, but must
be submitted individually to the appropriate national procedures on mutual recognition
and legal assistance, including rules imposed by bilateral agreements;

12.	Points out that the abovementioned concerns are exacerbated by rapid technological
and societal developments; considers that, since internet and mobile devices are
everywhere in modern daily life (‘ubiquitous computing’) and the business model of
most internet companies is based on the processing of personal data of all kinds that
puts at risk the integrity of the person, the scale of this problem is unprecedented;

13.	Regards it as a clear finding, as emphasised by the technology experts who testified
before the inquiry, that at the current stage of technological development there is no
guarantee, either for EU public institutions or for citizens, that their IT security or
privacy can be protected from intrusion by well-equipped third countries or EU
intelligence agencies (‘no 100% IT security’); notes that this alarming situation can
only be remedied if Europeans are willing to dedicate sufficient resources, both human
and financial, to preserving Europe’s independence and self-reliance;

14.	Strongly rejects the notion that these issues are purely a matter of national security and
therefore the sole competence of Member States; recalls a recent ruling of the Court of
Justice according to which ‘although it is for Member States to take the appropriate
measures to ensure their internal and external security, the mere fact that a decision
concerns State security cannot result in European Union law being inapplicable’2;
recalls further that the protection of the privacy of all EU citizens is at stake, as are the
security and reliability of all EU communication networks; believes therefore that
discussion and action at EU level is not only legitimate, but also a matter of EU
autonomy and sovereignty;

15.	Commends the current discussions, inquiries and reviews concerning the subject of
this inquiry in several parts of the world; points to the Global Government
Surveillance Reform signed up to by the world’s leading technology companies,
which calls for sweeping changes to national surveillance laws, including an
international ban on bulk collection of data to help preserve the public’s trust in the
internet; notes with great interest the recommendations published recently by the US
President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies;
strongly urges governments to take these calls and recommendations fully into account
and to overhaul their national frameworks for the intelligence services in order to
implement appropriate safeguards and oversight;

16.	Commends the institutions and experts who have contributed to this inquiry; deplores
the fact that several Member States’ authorities have declined to cooperate with the
inquiry the European Parliament has been conducting on behalf of citizens; welcomes
the openness of several Members of Congress and of national parliaments;

17.	Is aware that in such a limited timeframe it has been possible to conduct only a
preliminary investigation of all the issues at stake since July 2013; recognises both the
scale of the revelations involved and their ongoing nature; adopts, therefore, a
forward-planning approach consisting in a set of specific proposals and a mechanism
for follow-up action in the next parliamentary term, ensuring the findings remain high
on the EU political agenda;

18.	Intends to request strong political undertakings from the European Commission to be
designated after the May 2014 elections to implement the proposals and
recommendations of this Inquiry; expects adequate commitment from the candidates
in the upcoming parliamentary hearings for the new Commissioners;

Recommendations

19.	Calls on the US authorities and the EU Member States to prohibit blanket mass
surveillance activities and bulk processing of personal data;

20.	Calls on certain EU Member States, including the UK, Germany, France, Sweden and
the Netherlands, to revise where necessary their national legislation and practices
governing the activities of intelligence services so as to ensure that they are in line
with the standards of the European Convention on Human Rights and comply with
their fundamental rights obligations as regards data protection, privacy and
presumption of innocence; in particular, given the extensive media reports referring to
mass surveillance in the UK, would emphasise that the current legal framework which
is made up of a ‘complex interaction’ between three separate pieces of legislation -
the Human Rights Act 1998, the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000 - should be revised;

21.	Calls on the Member States to refrain from accepting data from third states which
have been collected unlawfully and from allowing surveillance activities on their
territory by third states’ governments or agencies which are unlawful under national
law or do not meet the legal safeguards enshrined in international or EU instruments,
including the protection of Human Rights under the TEU, the ECHR and the EU
Charter of Fundamental Rights;

22.	Calls on the Member States immediately to fulfil their positive obligation under the
European Convention on Human Rights to protect their citizens from surveillance
contrary to its requirements, including when the aim thereof is to safeguard national
security, undertaken by third states and to ensure that the rule of law is not weakened
as a result of extraterritorial application of a third country’s law;

23.	Invites the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe to launch the Article 52
procedure according to which ‘on receipt of a request from the Secretary General of
the Council of Europe any High Contracting Party shall furnish an explanation of the

PR\1014703EN.doc	19/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

manner in which its internal law ensures the effective implementation of any of the
provisions of the Convention’;

24.	Calls on Member States to take appropriate action immediately, including court action,
against the breach of their sovereignty, and thereby the violation of general public
international law, perpetrated through the mass surveillance programmes; calls further
on EU Member States to make use of all available international measures to defend
EU citizens’ fundamental rights, notably by triggering the inter-state complaint
procedure under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR);

25.	Calls on the US to revise its legislation without delay in order to bring it into line with
international law, to recognise the privacy and other rights of EU citizens, to provide
for judicial redress for EU citizens and to sign the Additional Protocol allowing for
complaints by individuals under the ICCPR;

26.	Strongly opposes any conclusion of an additional protocol or guidance to the Council
of Europe Cybercrime Convention (Budapest Convention) on transborder access to
stored computer data which could provide for a legitimisation of intelligence services’
access to data stored in another jurisdiction without its authorisation and without the
use of existing mutual legal assistance instruments, since this could result in unfettered
remote access by law enforcement authorities to servers and computers located in
other jurisdictions and would be in conflict with Council of Europe Convention 108;

27.	Calls on the Commission to carry out, before July 2014, an assessment of the
applicability of Regulation EC No 2271/96 to cases of conflict of laws for transfers of
personal data;

International transfers of data

US data protection legal framework and US Safe Harbour

28.	Notes that the companies identified by media revelations as being involved in the
large-scale mass surveillance of EU data subjects by US NSA are companies that have
self-certified their adherence to the Safe Harbour, and that the Safe Harbour is the
legal instrument used for the transfer of EU personal data to the US (Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo!, Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn); expresses its concerns on the fact
that these organisations admitted that they do not encrypt information and
communications flowing between their data centres, thereby enabling intelligence
services to intercept information1;

29.	Considers that large-scale access by US intelligence agencies to EU personal data
processed by Safe Harbour does not per se meet the criteria for derogation under
‘national security’;

30.	Takes the view that, as under the current circumstances the Safe Harbour principles do
not provide adequate protection for EU citizens, these transfers should be carried out

under other instruments, such as contractual clauses or BCRs setting out specific
safeguards and protections;

31.	Calls on the Commission to present measures providing for the immediate suspension
of Commission Decision 520/2000, which declared the adequacy of the Safe Harbour
privacy principles, and of the related FAQs issued by the US Department of
Commerce;

32.	Calls on Member States’ competent authorities, namely the data protection authorities,
to make use of their existing powers and immediately suspend data flows to any
organisation that has self-certified its adherence to the US Safe Harbour Principles and
to require that such data flows are only carried out under other instruments, provided
they contain the necessary safeguards and protections with respect to the protection of
the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals;

33.	Calls on the Commission to present by June 2014 a comprehensive assessment of the
US privacy framework covering commercial, law enforcement and intelligence
activities in response to the fact that the EU and the US legal systems for protecting
personal data are drifting apart;

Transfers to other third countries with adequacy decision

34.	Recalls that Directive 95/46/EC stipulates that transfers of personal data to a third
country may take place only if, without prejudice to compliance with the national
provisions adopted pursuant to the other provisions of the Directive, the third country
in question ensures an adequate level of protection, the purpose of this provision being
to ensure the continuity of the protection afforded by EU data protection law where
personal data are transferred outside the EU;

35.	Recalls that Directive 95/46/EC provides that the adequacy of the level of protection
afforded by a third country is to be assessed in the light of all the circumstances
surrounding a data transfer operation or set of data transfer operations; likewise recalls
that the said Directive also equips the Commission with implementing powers to
declare that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection in the light of the
criteria laid down by Directive 95/46/EC; whereas Directive 95/46/EC also empowers
the Commission to declare that a third country does not ensure an adequate level of
protection;

36.	Recalls that in the latter case Member States must take the measures necessary to
prevent any transfer of data of the same type to the third country in question, and that
the Commission should enter into negotiations with a view to remedying the situation;

37.	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to assess without delay whether the
adequate level of protection of the New Zealand and of the Canadian Personal
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, as declared by Commission
Decisions 2013/651 and 2/2002 of 20 December 2001, have been affected by the
involvement of their national intelligence agencies in the mass surveillance of EU 1

citizens and, if necessary, to take appropriate measures to suspend or revers the
adequacy decisions; expects the Commission to report to the European Parliament on
its findings on the abovementioned countries by December 2014 at the latest;

Transfers based on contractual clauses and other instruments

38.	Recalls that national data protection authorities have indicated that neither standard
contractual clauses nor BCRs were written with situations of access to personal data
for mass surveillance purposes in mind, and that such access would not be in line with
the derogation clauses of the contractual clauses or BCRs which refer to exceptional
derogations for a legitimate interest in a democratic society and where necessary and
proportionate;

39.	Calls on the Member States to prohibit or suspend data flows to third countries based
on the standard contractual clauses, contractual clauses or BCRs authorised by the
national competent authorities where it is established that the law to which the data
importer is subject imposes upon him requirements which go beyond the restrictions
necessary in a democratic society and which are likely to have a substantial adverse
effect on the guarantees provided by the applicable data protection law and the
standard contractual clauses, or because continuing transfer would create an imminent
risk of grave harm to the data subjects;

40.	Calls on the Article 29 Working Party to issue guidelines and recommendations on the
safeguards and protections that contractual instruments for international transfers of
EU personal data should contain in order to ensure the protection of the privacy,
fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, taking particular account of the
third-country laws on intelligence and national security and the involvement of the
companies receiving the data in a third country in mass surveillance activities by a
third country’s intelligence agencies;

41.	Calls on the Commission to examine the standard contractual clauses it has established
in order to assess whether they provide the necessary protection as regards access to
personal data transferred under the clauses for intelligence purposes and, if
appropriate, to review them;

Transfers based on the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement

42.	Calls on the Commission to conduct before the end 2014 an in-depth assessment of the
existing Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, pursuant to its Article 17, in order to
verify its practical implementation and, in particular, whether the US has made
effective use of it for obtaining information or evidence in the EU and whether the
Agreement has been circumvented to acquire the information directly in the EU, and
to assess the impact on the fundamental rights of individuals; such an assessment
should not only refer to US official statements as a sufficient basis for the analysis but
be based on specific EU evaluations; this in-depth review should also address the
consequences of the application of the Union’s constitutional architecture to this
instrument in order to bring it into line with Union law, taking account in particular of
Protocol 36 and Article 10 thereof and Declaration 50 concerning this protocol;

EU mutual assistance in criminal matters

43.	Asks the Council and the Commission to inform Parliament about the actual use by
Member States of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between
the Member States, in particular Title III on interception of telecommunications; calls
on the Commission to put forward a proposal, in accordance with Declaration 50,
concerning Protocol 36, as requested, before the end of 2014 in order to adapt it to the
Lisbon Treaty framework;

Transfers based on the TFTP and PNR agreements

44.	Takes the view that the information provided by the European Commission and the
US Treasury does not clarify whether US intelligence agencies have access to SWIFT
financial messages in the EU by intercepting SWIFT networks or banks’ operating
systems or communication networks, alone or in cooperation with EU national
intelligence agencies and without having recourse to existing bilateral channels for
mutual legal assistance and judicial cooperation;

45.	Reiterates its resolution of 23 October 2013 and asks the Commission for the
suspension of the TFTP Agreement;

46.	Calls on the European Commission to react to concerns that three of the major
computerised reservation systems used by airlines worldwide are based in the US and
that PNR data are saved in cloud systems operating on US soil under US law, which
lacks data protection adequacy;

Framework agreement on data protection in the field of police and judicial cooperation

(‘Umbrella agreement ’)

47.	Considers that a satisfactory solution under the ‘Umbrella agreement’ is a
pre-condition for the full restoration of trust between the transatlantic partners;

48.	Asks for an immediate resumption of the negotiations with the US on the ‘Umbrella
Agreement’, which should provide for clear rights for EU citizens and effective and
enforceable administrative and judicial remedies in the US without any discrimination;

49.	Asks the Commission and the Council not to initiate any new sectorial agreements or
arrangements for the transfer of personal data for law enforcement purposes as long as
the ‘Umbrella Agreement’ has not entered into force;

50.	Urges the Commission to report in detail on the various points of the negotiating
mandate and the latest state of play by April 2014;

Data protection reform

51.	Calls on the Council Presidency and the majority of Member States who support a
high level of data protection to show a sense of leadership and responsibility and
accelerate their work on the whole Data Protection Package to allow for adoption in
2014, so that EU citizens will be able to enjoy better protection in the very near future;

52.	Stresses that both the Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Directive are
necessary to protect the fundamental rights of individuals and therefore must be
treated as a package to be adopted simultaneously, in order to ensure that all data-
processing activities in the EU provide a high level of protection in all circumstances;

Cloud computing

53.	Notes that trust in US cloud computing and cloud providers has been negatively
affected by the abovementioned practices; emphasises, therefore, the development of
European clouds as an essential element for growth and employment and trust in cloud
computing services and providers and for ensuring a high level of personal data
protection;

54.	Reiterates its serious concerns about the compulsory direct disclosure of EU personal
data and information processed under cloud agreements to third-country authorities by
cloud providers subject to third-country laws or using storage servers located in third
countries, and about direct remote access to personal data and information processed
by third-country law enforcement authorities and intelligence services;

55.	Regrets the fact that such access is usually attained by means of direct enforcement by
third-country authorities of their own legal rules, without recourse to international
instruments established for legal cooperation such as mutual legal assistance (MLA)
agreements or other forms of judicial cooperation;

56.	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to speed up the work of establishing
a European Cloud Partnership;

57.	Recalls that all companies providing services in the EU must, without exception,
comply with EU law and are liable for any breaches;

Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement (TTIP)

58.	Recognises that the EU and the US are pursuing negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership, which is of major strategic importance for creating further
economic growth and for the ability of both the EU and the US to set future global
regulatory standards;

59.	Strongly emphasises, given the importance of the digital economy in the relationship
and in the cause of rebuilding EU-US trust, that the European Parliament will only
consent to the final TTIP agreement provided the agreement fully respects
fundamental rights recognised by the EU Charter, and that the protection of the
privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data
must continue to be governed by Article XIV of the GATS;

Democratic oversight of intelligence services

60.	Stresses that, despite the fact that oversight of intelligence services’ activities should
be based on both democratic legitimacy (strong legal framework, ex ante authorisation
and ex post verification) and an adequate technical capability and expertise, the

PE526.085v02-00

majority of current EU and US oversight bodies dramatically lack both, in particular
the technical capabilities;

61.	Invites, as it has done in the case of Echelon, all national parliaments which have not
yet done so to install meaningful oversight of intelligence activities by
parliamentarians or expert bodies with legal powers to investigate; calls on national
parliaments to ensure that such oversight committees/bodies have sufficient resources,
technical expertise and legal means to be able to effectively control intelligence
services;

62.	Calls for the setting up of a high-level group to strengthen cooperation in the field of
intelligence at EU level, combined with a proper oversight mechanism ensuring both
democratic legitimacy and adequate technical capacity; stresses that the high-level
group should cooperate closely with national parliaments in order to propose further
steps to be taken for increased oversight collaboration in the EU;

63.	Calls on this high-level group to define minimum European standards or guidelines on
the (ex ante and ex post) oversight of intelligence services on the basis of existing best
practices and recommendations by international bodies (UN, Council of Europe);

64.	Calls on the high-level group to set strict limits on the duration of any surveillance
ordered unless its continuation is duly justified by the authorising/oversight authority;

65.	Calls on the high-level group to develop criteria on enhanced transparency, built on
the general principle of access to information and the so-called ‘Tshwane Principles’1;

66.	Intends to organise a conference with national oversight bodies, whether parliamentary
or independent, by the end of 2014;

67.	Calls on the Member States to draw on best practices so as to improve access by their
oversight bodies to information on intelligence activities (including classified
information and information from other services) and establish the power to conduct
on-site visits, a robust set of powers of interrogation, adequate resources and technical
expertise, strict independence vis-à-vis their respective governments, and a reporting
obligation to their respective parliaments;

68.	Calls on the Member States to develop cooperation among oversight bodies, in
particular within the European Network of National Intelligence Reviewers (ENNIR);

69.	Urges the Commission to present, by September 2014, a proposal for a legal basis for
the activities of the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (IntCen), as well as a proper
oversight mechanism adapted to its activities, including regular reporting to the
European Parliament;

70.	Calls on the Commission to present, by September 2014, a proposal for an EU security
clearance procedure for all EU office holders, as the current system, which relies on
the security clearance undertaken by the Member State of citizenship, provides for

different requirements and lengths of procedures within national systems, thus leading
to differing treatment of Members of Parliament and their staff depending on their
nationality;

71.	Recalls the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement between the European
Parliament and the Council concerning the forwarding to and handling by the
European Parliament of classified information held by the Council on matters other
than those in the area of the common foreign and security policy that should be used to
improve oversight at EU level;

EU agencies

72.	Calls on the Europol Joint Supervisory Body, together with national data protection
authorities, to conduct a joint inspection before the end of 2014 in order to ascertain
whether information and personal data shared with Europol has been lawfully acquired
by national authorities, particularly if the information or data was initially acquired by
intelligence services in the EU or a third country, and whether appropriate measures
are in place to prevent the use and further dissemination of such information or data;

73.	Calls on Europol to ask the competent authorities of the Member States, in line with
its competences, to initiate investigations with regard to possible cybercrimes and
cyber attacks committed by governments or private actors in the course of the
activities under scrutiny;

Freedom of expression

74.	Expresses deep concern about the developing threats to the freedom of the press and
the chilling effect on journalists of intimidation by state authorities, in particular as
regards the protection of confidentiality of journalistic sources; reiterates the calls
expressed in its resolution of 21 May 2013 on ‘the EU Charter: standard settings for
media freedom across the EU’;

75.	Considers that the detention of Mr Miranda and the seizure of the material in his
possession under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (and also the request to The
Guardian to destroy or hand over the material) constitutes an interference with the
right of freedom of expression as recognised by Article 10 of the ECHR and Article 11
of the EU Charter;

76.	Calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal for a comprehensive framework
for the protection of whistleblowers in the EU, with particular attention to the
specificities of whistleblowing in the field of intelligence, for which provisions
relating to whistleblowing in the financial field may prove insufficient, and including
strong guarantees of immunity;

EU IT security

77.	Points out that recent incidents clearly demonstrate the acute vulnerability of the EU,
and in particular the EU institutions, national governments and parliaments, major
European companies, European IT infrastructures and networks, to sophisticated

PE526.085v02-00

EN

attacks using complex software; notes that these attacks require such financial and
human resources that they are likely to originate from state entities acting on behalf of
foreign governments or even from certain EU national governments that support them;
in this context, regards the case of the hacking or tapping of the telecommunications
company Belgacom as a worrying example of an attack against the EU’s IT capacity;

78.	Takes the view that the mass surveillance revelations that have initiated this crisis can
be used as an opportunity for Europe to take the initiative and build up an autonomous
IT key-resource capability for the mid term; calls on the Commission and the Member
States to use public procurement as leverage to support such resource capability in the
EU by making EU security and privacy standards a key requirement in the public
procurement of IT goods and services;

79.	Is highly concerned by indications that foreign intelligence services sought to lower IT
security standards and to install backdoors in a broad range of IT systems;

80.	Calls on all the Members States, the Commission, the Council and the European
Council to address the EU’s dangerous lack of autonomy in terms of IT tools,
companies and providers (hardware, software, services and network), and encryption
and cryptographic capabilities;

81.	Calls on the Commission, standardisation bodies and ENISA to develop, by
September 2014, minimum security and privacy standards and guidelines for IT
systems, networks and services, including cloud computing services, in order to better
protect EU citizens’ personal data; believes that such standards should be set in an
open and democratic process, not driven by a single country, entity or multinational
company; takes the view that, while legitimate law enforcement and intelligence
concerns need to be taken into account in order to support the fight against terrorism,
they should not lead to a general undermining of the dependability of all IT systems;

82.	Points out that both telecom companies and the EU and national telecom regulators
have clearly neglected the IT security of their users and clients; calls on the
Commission to make full use of its existing powers under the ePrivacy and
Telecommunication Framework Directive to strengthen the protection of
confidentiality of communication by adopting measures to ensure that terminal
equipment is compatible with the right of users to control and protect their personal
data, and to ensure a high level of security of telecommunication networks and
services, including by way of requiring state-of-the-art encryption of communications;

83.	Supports the EU cyber strategy but considers that it does not cover all possible threats
and should be extended to cover malicious state behaviours;

84.	Calls on the Commission, by January 2015 at the latest, to present an Action Plan to
develop more EU independence in the IT sector, including a more coherent approach
to boosting European IT technological capabilities (including IT systems, equipment,
services, cloud computing, encryption and anonymisation) and to the protection of
critical IT infrastructure (including in terms of ownership and vulnerability);

85.	Calls on the Commission, in the framework of the next Work Programme of the

PR\1014703EN.doc	27/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

Horizon 2020 Programme, to assess whether more resources should be directed
towards boosting European research, development, innovation and training in the field
of IT technologies, in particular privacy-enhancing technologies and infrastructures,
cryptology, secure computing, open-source security solutions and the Information
Society;

86.	Asks the Commission to map out current responsibilities and to review, by June 2014
at the latest, the need for a broader mandate, better coordination and/or additional
resources and technical capabilities for Europol’s CyberCrime Centre, ENISA,
CERT-EU and the EDPS in order to enable them to be more effective in investigating
major IT breaches in the EU and in performing (or assisting Member States and EU
bodies to perform) on-site technical investigations regarding major IT breaches;

87.	Deems it necessary for the EU to be supported by an EU IT Academy that brings
together the best European experts in all related fields, tasked with providing all
relevant EU Institutions and bodies with scientific advice on IT technologies,
including security-related strategies; as a first step asks the Commission to set up an
independent scientific expert panel;

88.	Calls on the European Parliament’s Secretariat to carry out, by September 2014 at the
latest, a thorough review and assessment of the European Parliament’s IT security
dependability focused on: budgetary means, staff resources, technical capabilities,
internal organisation and all relevant elements, in order to achieve a high level of
security for the EP’s IT systems; believes that such an assessment should at the least
provide information analysis and recommendations on:

•	the need for regular, rigorous, independent security audits and penetration tests,
with the selection of outside security experts ensuring transparency and
guarantees of their credentials vis-à-vis third countries or any types of vested
interest;

•	the inclusion in tender procedures for new IT systems of specific IT
security/privacy requirements, including the possibility of a requirement for
Open Source Software as a condition of purchase;

•	the list of US companies under contract with the European Parliament in the IT
and telecom fields, taking into account revelations about NSA contracts with a
company such as RSA, whose products the European Parliament is using to
supposedly protect remote access to their data by its Members and staff;

•	the reliability and resilience of third-party commercial software used by the EU
institutions in their IT systems with regard to penetrations and intrusions by EU
or third-country law enforcement and intelligence authorities;

•	the use of more open-source systems and fewer off-the-shelf commercial
systems;

•	the impact of the increased use of mobile tools (smartphones, tablets, whether
professional or personal) and its effects on the IT security of the system;

PE526.085v02-00	28/52	PR\1014703EN.doc

EN

•	the security of the communications between different workplaces of the
European Parliament and of the IT systems used at the European Parliament;

•	the use and location of servers and IT centres for the EP’s IT systems and the
implications for the security and integrity of the systems;

•	the implementation in reality of the existing rules on security breaches and
prompt notification of the competent authorities by the providers of publicly
available telecommunication networks;

•	the use of cloud storage by the EP, including what kind of data is stored on the
cloud, how the content and access to it is protected and where the cloud is
located, clarifying the applicable data protection legal regime;

•	a plan allowing for the use of more cryptographic technologies, in particular
end-to-end authenticated encryption for all IT and communications services
such as cloud computing, email, instant messaging and telephony;

•	the use of electronic signature in email;

•	an analysis of the benefits of using the GNU Privacy Guard as a default
encryption standard for emails which would at the same time allow for the use
of digital signatures;

•	the possibility of setting up a secure Instant Messaging service within the
European Parliament allowing secure communication, with the server only
seeing encrypted content;

89.	Calls on all the EU Institutions and agencies to perform a similar exercise, by
December 2014 at the latest, in particular the European Council, the Council, the
External Action Service (including EU delegations), the Commission, the Court of
Justice and the European Central Bank; invites the Member States to conduct similar
assessments;

90.	Stresses that as far as the external action of the EU is concerned, assessments of
related budgetary needs should be carried out and first measures taken without delay
in the case of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and that appropriate
funds need to be allocated in the 2015 Draft Budget;

91.	Takes the view that the large-scale IT systems used in the area of freedom, security
and justice, such as the Schengen Information System II, the Visa Information System,
Eurodac and possible future systems, should be developed and operated in such a way
as to ensure that data is not compromised as a result of US requests under the Patriot
Act; asks eu-LISA to report back to Parliament on the reliability of the systems in
place by the end of 2014;

92.	Calls on the Commission and the EEAS to take action at the international level, with
the UN in particular, and in cooperation with interested partners (such as Brazil), and
to implement an EU strategy for democratic governance of the internet in order to

PR\1014703EN.doc	29/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

prevent undue influence over ICANN’s and IANA’s activities by any individual
entity, company or country by ensuring appropriate representation of all interested
parties in these bodies;

93.	Calls for the overall architecture of the internet in terms of data flows and storage to
be reconsidered, striving for more data minimisation and transparency and less
centralised mass storage of raw data, as well as avoiding unnecessary routing of traffic
through the territory of countries that do not meet basic standards on fundamental
rights, data protection and privacy;

94.	Calls on the Member States, in cooperation with ENISA, Europol’s CyberCrime
Centre, CERTs and national data protection authorities and cybercrime units, to start
an education and awareness-raising campaign in order to enable citizens to make a
more informed choice regarding what personal data to put on line and how better to
protect them, including through ‘digital hygiene’, encryption and safe cloud
computing, making full use of the public interest information platform provided for in
the Universal Service Directive;

95.	Calls on the Commission, by September 2014, to evaluate the possibilities of
encouraging software and hardware manufacturers to introduce more security and
privacy through default features in their products, including the possibility of
introducing legal liability on the part of manufacturers for unpatched known
vulnerabilities or the installation of secret backdoors, and disincentives for the undue
and disproportionate collection of mass personal data, and if appropriate to come
forward with legislative proposals;

Rebuilding trust

96.	Believes that the inquiry has shown the need for the US to restore trust with its
partners, as US intelligence agencies’ activities are primarily at stake;

97.	Points out that the crisis of confidence generated extends to:

-	the spirit of cooperation within the EU, as some national intelligence activities
may jeopardise the attainment of the Union’s objectives;

-	citizens, who realise that not only third countries or multinational companies,
but also their own government, may be spying on them;

-	respect for the rule of law and the credibility of democratic safeguards in a
digital society;

Between the EU and the US

98.	Recalls the important historical and strategic partnership between the EU Member
States and the US, based on a common belief in democracy, the rule of law and
fundamental rights;

99.	Believes that the mass surveillance of citizens and the spying on political leaders by

PE526.085v02-00	30/52	PR\1014703EN.doc

EN

the US have caused serious damage to relations between the EU and the US and
negatively impacted on trust in US organisations acting in the EU; this is further
exacerbated by the lack of judicial and administrative remedies for redress under US
law for EU citizens, particularly in cases of surveillance activities for intelligence
purposes;

100.	Recognises, in light of the global challenges facing the EU and the US, that the
transatlantic partnership needs to be further strengthened, and that it is vital that
transatlantic cooperation in counter-terrorism continues; insists, however, that clear
measures need to be taken by the US to re-establish trust and re-emphasise the shared
basic values underlying the partnership;

101.	Is ready actively to engage in a dialogue with US counterparts so that, in the ongoing
American public and congressional debate on reforming surveillance and reviewing
intelligence oversight, the privacy rights of EU citizens are addressed, equal
information rights and privacy protection in US courts guaranteed and the current
discrimination not perpetuated;

102.	Insists that necessary reforms be undertaken and effective guarantees given to
Europeans to ensure that the use of surveillance and data processing for foreign
intelligence purposes is limited by clearly specified conditions and related to
reasonable suspicion or probable cause of terrorist or criminal activity; stresses that
this purpose must be subject to transparent judicial oversight;

103.	Considers that clear political signals are needed from our American partners to
demonstrate that the US distinguishes between allies and adversaries;

104.	Urges the EU Commission and the US Administration to address, in the context of the
ongoing negotiations on an EU-US umbrella agreement on data transfer for law
enforcement purposes, the information and judicial redress rights of EU citizens, and
to conclude these negotiations, in line with the commitment made at the EU-US
Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Meeting of 18 November 2013, before summer
2014;

105.	Encourages the US to accede to the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection
of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention
108), as it acceded to the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, thus strengthening the
shared legal basis among the transatlantic allies;

106.	Calls on the EU institutions to explore the possibilities for establishing with the US a
code of conduct which would guarantee that no US espionage is pursued against EU
institutions and facilities;

Within the European Union

107.	Also believes that that the involvement and activities of EU Members States has led to
a loss of trust; is of the opinion that only full clarity as to purposes and means of
surveillance, public debate and, ultimately, revision of legislation, including a
strengthening of the system of judicial and parliamentary oversight, will be able to

PR\1014703EN.doc	31/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

re-establish the trust lost;

108.	Is aware that some EU Member States are pursuing bilateral communication with the
US authorities on spying allegations, and that some of them have concluded (United
Kingdom) or envisage concluding (Germany, France) so-called ‘anti-spying’
arrangements; underlines that these Member States need to observe fully the interests
of the EU as a whole;

109.	Considers that such arrangements should not breach European Treaties, especially the
principle of sincere cooperation (under Article 4 paragraph 3 TEU), or undermine EU
policies in general and, more specifically, the internal market, fair competition and
economic, industrial and social development; reserves its right to activate Treaty
procedures in the event of such arrangements being proved to contradict the Union’s
cohesion or the fundamental principles on which it is based;

Internationally

110.	Calls on the Commission to present, in January 2015 at the latest, an EU strategy for
democratic governance of the internet;

111.	Calls on the Member States to follow the call of the 35th International Conference of
Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners ‘to advocate the adoption of an additional
protocol to Article17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR), which should be based on the standards that have been developed and
endorsed by the International Conference and the provisions in General Comment No
16 to the Covenant in order to create globally applicable standards for data protection
and the protection of privacy in accordance with the rule of law’; asks the High
Representative/Vice-President of the Commission and the External Action Service to
take a proactive stance;

112.	Calls on the Member States to develop a coherent and strong strategy within the
United Nations, supporting in particular the resolution on ‘The right to privacy in the
digital age’ initiated by Brazil and Germany, as adopted by the third UN General
Assembly Committee (Human Rights Committee) on 27 November 2013;

Priority Plan: A European Digital Habeas Corpus

113.	Decides to submit to EU citizens, Institutions and Member States the abovementioned
recommendations as a Priority Plan for the next legislature;

114.	Decides to launch A European Digital Habeas Corpus for protecting privacy based on
the following 7 actions with a European Parliament watchdog:

Action 1: Adopt the Data Protection Package in 2014;

Action 2: Conclude the EU-US Umbrella Agreement ensuring proper redress
mechanisms for EU citizens in the event of data transfers from the EU to the US for
law-enforcement purposes;

Action 3: Suspend Safe Harbour until a full review has been conducted and current
loopholes are remedied, making sure that transfers of personal data for commercial
purposes from the Union to the US can only take place in compliance with highest
EU standards;

Action 4: Suspend the TFTP agreement until (i) the Umbrella Agreement
negotiations have been concluded; (ii) a thorough investigation has been concluded
on the basis of an EU analysis, and all concerns raised by Parliament in its
resolution of 23 October have been properly addressed;

Action 5: Protect the rule of law and the fundamental rights of EU citizens, with a
particular focus on threats to the freedom of the press and professional
confidentiality (including lawyer-client relations) as well as enhanced protection for
whistleblowers;

Action 6: Develop a European strategy for IT independence (at national and EU
level);

Action 7: Develop the EU as a reference player for a democratic and neutral
governance of the internet;

115.	Calls on the EU Institutions and the Member States to support and promote the
European Digital Habeas Corpus; undertakes to act as the EU citizens’ rights
watchdog, with the following timetable to monitor implementation:

•	April-July 2014: a monitoring group based on the LIBE inquiry team
responsible for monitoring any new revelations in the media concerning the
inquiry’s mandate and scrutinising the implementation of this resolution;

•	July 2014 onwards: a standing oversight mechanism for data transfers and
judicial remedies within the competent committee;

•	Spring 2014: a formal call on the European Council to include the European
Digital Habeas Corpus in the guidelines to be adopted under Article 68 TFEU;

•	Autumn 2014: a commitment that the European Digital Habeas Corpus and
related recommendations will serve as key criteria for the approval of the next

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

‘The office of the sovereign, be it a monarch or an assembly, consisteth in the end,

for which he was trusted with the sovereign power,
namely the procuration of the safety ofpeople ’
Hobbes, Leviathan (chapter XXX)

‘We cannot commend our society to others by departing
from the fundamental standards which
make it worthy of commendation ’
Lord Bingham of Cornhill,
Former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales

Methodology

From July 2013, the LIBE Committee of Inquiry was responsible for the extremely
challenging task of fulfilling the mandate1 of the Plenary on the investigation into the
electronic mass surveillance of EU citizens in a very short timeframe, less than 6 months.

During that period it held over 15 hearings covering each of the specific cluster issues
prescribed in the 4 July resolution, drawing on the submissions of both EU and US experts
representing a wide range of knowledge and backgrounds: EU institutions, national
parliaments, US congress, academics, journalists, civil society, security and technology
specialists and private business. In addition, a delegation of the LIBE Committee visited
Washington on 28-30 0ctober 2013 to meet with representatives of both the executive and the
legislative branch (academics, lawyers, security experts, business representatives)2. A
delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) was also in town at the same time. A
few meetings were held together.

A series of working documents3 have been co-authored by the rapporteur, the shadow-
rapporteurs4 from the various political groups and 3 Members from the AFET Committee5
enabling a presentation of the main findings of the Inquiry. The rapporteur would like to
thank all shadow rapporteurs and AFET Members for their close cooperation and high-level
commitment throughout this demanding process.

Scale of the problem

An increasing focus on security combined with developments in technology has enabled
States to know more about citizens than ever before. By being able to collect data

regarding the content of communications, as well as metadata, and by following citizens’
electronic activities, in particular their use of smartphones and tablet computers, intelligence
services are de facto able to know almost everything about a person. This has contributed to
a fundamental shift in the work and practices of intelligence agencies, away from the
traditional concept of targeted surveillance as a necessary and proportional counter-
terrorism measure, towards systems of mass surveillance.

This process of increasing mass surveillance has not been subject to any prior public
debate or democratic decision-making. Discussion is needed on the purpose and scale of
surveillance and its place in a democratic society. Is the situation created by Edward
Snowden’s revelations an indication of a general societal turn towards the acceptance of
the death of privacy in return for security? Do we face a breach of privacy and intimacy so
great that it is possible not only for criminals but for IT companies and intelligence agencies
to know every detail of the life of a citizen? Is it a fact to be accepted without further
discussion? Or is the responsibility of the legislator to adapt the policy and legal tools at hand
to limit the risks and prevent further damages in case less democratic forces would come to
power?

Reactions to mass surveillance and a public debate

The debate on mass surveillance does not take place in an even manner inside the EU. In fact
in many Member States there is hardly any public debate and media attention varies. Germany
seems to be the country where reactions to the revelations have been strongest and public
discussions as to their consequences have been widespread. In the United Kingdom and
France, in spite of investigations by The Guardian and Le Monde, reactions seem more
limited, a fact that has been linked to the alleged involvement of their national intelligence
services in activities with the NSA. The LIBE Committee Inquiry has been in a position to
hear valuable contributions from the parliamentary oversight bodies of Belgian, the
Netherlands, Denmark and even Norway; however the British and French Parliament have
declined participation. These differences show again the uneven degree of checks and
balances within the EU on these issues and that more cooperation is needed between
parliamentary bodies in charge of oversight.

Following the disclosures of Edward Snowden in the mass media, public debate has been
based on two main types of reactions. On the one hand, there are those who deny the
legitimacy of the information published on the grounds that most of the media reports are
based on misinterpretation; in addition many argue, while not having refuted the disclosures,
the validity of the disclosures made due to allegations of security risks they cause for national
security and the fight against terrorism.

On the other hand, there are those who consider the information provided requires an
informed, public debate because of the magnitude of the problems it raises to issues key to a
democracy including: the rule of law, fundamental rights, citizens’ privacy, public
accountability of law-enforcement and intelligence services, etc. This is certainly the case for
the journalists and editors of the world’s biggest press outlets who are privy to the disclosures
including The Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, The Washington Post and Glenn
Greenwald.

The two types of reactions outlined above are based on a set of reasons which, if followed,
PE526.085v02-00	36/52	PR\1014703EN.doc

EN

may lead to quite opposed decisions as to how the EU should or should not react.
5 reasons not to act

-	The ‘Intelligence/national security argument ’: no EU competence

Edward Snowden’s revelations relate to US and some Member States’ intelligence
activities, but national security is a national competence, the EU has no competence in
such matters (except on EU internal security) and therefore no action is possible at EU
level.

-	The ‘Terrorism argument ’: danger of the whistleblower

Any follow up to these revelations, or their mere consideration, further weakens the
security of the US as well as the EU as it does not condemn the publication of documents
the content of which even if redacted as involved media players explain may give valuable
information to terrorist groups.

-	The ‘Treason argument: no legitimacy for the whistleblower

As mainly put forward by some in the US and in the United Kingdom, any debate
launched or action envisaged further to E. Snowden’s revelations is intrinsically biased
and irrelevant as they would be based on an initial act of treason.

-	The ‘realism argument ’: general strategic interests

Even if some mistakes and illegal activities were to be confirmed, they should be balanced
against the need to maintain the special relationship between the US and Europe to
preserve shared economic, business and foreign policy interests.

-	The ‘Good government argument’: trust your government

US and EU Governments are democratically elected. In the field of security, and even
when intelligence activities are conducted in order to fight against terrorism, they comply
with democratic standards as a matter of principle. This ‘presumption of good and lawful
governance’ rests not only on the goodwill of the holders of the executive powers in these
states but also on the checks and balances mechanism enshrined in their constitutional
systems.

As one can see reasons not to act are numerous and powerful. This may explain why most EU
governments, after some initial strong reactions, have preferred not to act. The main action by
the Council of Ministers has been to set up a ‘transatlantic group of experts on data
protection’ which has met 3 times and put forward a final report. A second group is supposed
to have met on intelligence related issues between US authorities and Member States’ ones
but no information is available. The European Council has addressed the surveillance problem
in a mere statement of Heads of state or government1, Up until now only a few national

note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before

EN

parliaments have launched inquiries.
5 reasons to act

-	The ‘mass surveillance argument ’: in which society do we want to live?

Since the very first disclosure in June 2013, consistent references have been made to
George’s Orwell novel ‘1984’. Since 9/11 attacks, a focus on security and a shift towards
targeted and specific surveillance has seriously damaged and undermined the concept of
privacy. The history of both Europe and the US shows us the dangers of mass surveillance
and the graduation towards societies without privacy.

-	The ‘fundamental rights argument ’:

Mass and indiscriminate surveillance threaten citizens ’ fundamental rights including right
to privacy, data protection, freedom of press, fair trial which are all enshrined in the EU
Treaties, the Charter of fundamental rights and the ECHR. These rights cannot be
circumvented nor be negotiated against any benefit expected in exchange unless duly
provided for in legal instruments and in full compliance with the treaties.

-	The ‘EU internal security argument ’:

National competence on intelligence and national security matters does not exclude a
parallel EU competence. The EU has exercised the competences conferred upon it by the
EU Treaties in matters of internal security by deciding on a number of legislative
instruments and international agreements aimed at fighting serious crime and terrorism, on
setting-up an internal security strategy and agencies working in this field. In addition,
other services have been developed reflecting the need for increased cooperation at EU
level on intelligence-related matters: INTCEN (placed within EEAS) and the Anti-
terrorism Coordinator (placed within the Council general secretariat), neither of them with
a legal basis.

-	The ‘deficient oversight argument ’

While intelligence services perform an indispensable function in protecting against
internal and external threats, they have to operate within the rule of law and to do so must
be subject to a stringent and thorough oversight mechanism. The democratic oversight of
intelligence activities is conducted at national level but due to the international nature of
security threats there is now a huge exchange of information between Member States and
with third countries like the US; improvements in oversight mechanisms are needed both at
national and at EU level if traditional oversight mechanisms are not to become ineffective
and outdated.

-	The ‘chilling effect on media ’ and the protection of whistleblowers

The disclosures of Edward Snowden and the subsequent media reports have highlighted the

the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field. They noted that other EU countries are
welcome to join this initiative. They also pointed to the existing Working Group between the EU and the USA
on the related issue of data protection and called for rapid and constructive progress in that respect’.

PE526.085v02-00	38/52	PR\1014703EN.doc

EN

pivotal role of the media in a democracy to ensure accountability of Governments. When
supervisory mechanisms fail to prevent or rectify mass surveillance, the role of media and
whistleblowers in unveiling eventual illegalities or misuses of power is extremely important.
Reactions from the US and UK authorities to the media have shown the vulnerability of both
the press and whistleblowers and the urgent need to do more to protect them.

The European Union is called on to choose between a ‘business as usual’ policy (sufficient
reasons not to act, wait and see) and a ‘reality check’ policy (surveillance is not new, but there
is enough evidence of an unprecedented magnitude of the scope and capacities of intelligence
agencies requiring the EU to act).

Habeas Corpus in a Surveillance Society

In 1679 the British parliament adopted the Habeas Corpus Act as a major step forward in
securing the right to a judge in times of rival jurisdictions and conflicts of laws. Nowadays
our democracies ensure proper rights for a convicted or detainee who is in person physically
subject to a criminal proceeding or deferred to a court. But his or her data, as posted,
processed, stored and tracked on digital networks form a ‘body of personal data’, a kind of
digital body specific to every individual and enabling to reveal much of his or her identity,
habits and preferences of all types.

Habeas Corpus is recognised as a fundamental legal instrument to safeguarding individual
freedom against arbitrary state action. What is needed today is an extension of Habeas Corpus
to the digital era. Right to privacy, respect of the integrity and the dignity of the individual are
at stake. Mass collections of data with no respect for EU data protection rules and specific
violations of the proportionality principle in the data management run counter to the
constitutional traditions of the Member States and the fundaments of the European
constitutional order.

The main novelty today is these risks do not only originate in criminal activities (against
which the EU legislator has adopted a series of instruments) or from possible cyber-attacks
from governments of countries with a lower democratic record. There is a realisation that such
risks may also come from law-enforcement and intelligence services of democratic countries
putting EU citizens or companies under conflicts of laws resulting in a lesser legal certainty,
with possible violations of rights without proper redress mechanisms.

Governance of networks is needed to ensure the safety of personal data. Before modern states
developed, no safety on roads or city streets could be guaranteed and physical integrity was at
risk. Nowadays, despite dominating everyday life, information highways are not secure.
Integrity of digital data must be secured, against criminals of course but also against possible
abuse of power by state authorities or contractors and private companies under secret judicial
warrants.

LIBE Committee Inquiry Recommendations

Many of the problems raised today are extremely similar to those revealed by the European
Parliament Inquiry on the Echelon programme in 2001. The impossibility for the previous
legislature to follow up on the findings and recommendations of the Echelon Inquiry should
serve as a key lesson to this Inquiry. It is for this reason that this Resolution, recognising both

PR\1014703EN.doc	39/52	PE526.085v02-00

EN

the magnitude of the revelations involved and their ongoing nature, is forward planning and
ensures that there are specific proposals on the table for follow up action in the next
Parliamentary mandate ensuring the findings remain high on the EU political agenda.

Based on this assessment, the rapporteur would like to submit to the vote of the Parliament the
following measures:

A European Digital Habeas corpus for protecting privacy based on 7 actions:

Action 1: Adopt the Data Protection Package in 2014;

Action 2: Conclude the EU-US Umbrella agreement ensuring proper redress
mechanisms for EU citizens in case of data transfers from the EU to the US for law-
enforcement purposes;

Action 3: Suspend Safe Harbour until a full review is conducted and current
loopholes are remedied making sure that transfers of personal data for commercial
purposes from the Union to the US can only take place in compliance with EU
highest standards;

Action 4: Suspend the TFTP agreement until i) the Umbrella agreement
negotiations have been concluded; ii) a thorough investigation has been concluded
based on EU analysis and all concerns raised by the Parliament in its resolution of
23 October have been properly addressed;

Action 5: Protect the rule of law and the fundamental rights of EU citizens, with a
particular focus on threats to the freedom of the press and professional
confidentiality (including lawyer-client relations) as well as enhanced protection for
whistleblowers;

Action 6: Develop a European strategy for IT independence (at national and EU
level);

Action 7: Develop the EU as a reference player for a democratic and neutral
governance of Internet;

After the conclusion of the Inquiry the European Parliament should continue acting as EU
citizens’ rights watchdog with the following timetable to monitor implementations:

•	April-July 2014: a monitoring group based on the LIBE Inquiry team
responsible for monitoring any new revelations in the media concerning the
Inquiries mandate and scrutinising the implementation of this resolution;

•	July 2014 onwards: a standing oversight mechanism for data transfers and
judicial remedies within the competent committee;

• Spring 2014: a formal call on the European Council to include the European
Digital Habeas Corpus in the guidelines to be adopted under Article 68 TFEU;
