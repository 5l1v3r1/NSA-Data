DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Integration of the IOTC into SID<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 10/04/2004<br><br>(S//SI//REL) SID has been working with the Information Operations Technology Center (IOTC)<br>since its inception. Our collaboration reached a high point during 2002-2003 when we came<br>together as "Team Meade" (including our Defensive Information Operations colleagues over in<br>Information Assurance) to characterize the Iraqi Internet and then support electronic military<br>actions against targets on that system.<br>(U//FOUO) As you've read in DIRgram-345: IOTC Mission Accomplished , we are now taking our<br>relationship a step further -- integration. As of 1 October, the following major IOTC elements will<br>become part of SID:<br>CCG (Community Coordination Group) -- joining S15/Information Warfare Support<br>Center<br>AAG (Analysis and Assessments Group) -- joining S2K/SIGINT Support to Information<br>Operations<br>ATG (Advanced Technology Group) -- joining S32/Tailored Access Operations<br>To the IOTC workforce as it joins our ranks: we're delighted to have you on the SID team!<br>(U//FOUO) We've done a good job matching up IOTC functions within the three SID "bubbles"<br>(i.e. S1, S2 and S3), but ultimate success will depend on continued horizontal coordination<br>across the corporation to make sure that we "deliver" on Computer Network Operations-related<br>requirements -- a shifting mix of intelligence, tools and access, depending on the situation. Our<br>focus is on measurable success and we'll stay flexible as we work out the best processes to get<br>the job done.<br>(U//FOUO) SID didn't get where it is today by sitting still. We have always used our existing<br>knowledge to grapple with the tougher targets on the horizon and to anticipate new challenges<br>beyond that. Please take the time to become familiar with our new business lines that come with<br>integration and welcome the talented people from IOTC who are joining us.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
