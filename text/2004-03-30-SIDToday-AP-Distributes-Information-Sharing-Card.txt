That<br>can take many forms, and it can serve many purposes. Among the most important is the<br>enabling of the analytic process, which often requires dialog and collaboration, increasingly with<br>individuals beyond traditional boundaries. Implicit is the realization that the power is not in the<br>data or information alone but in the analysis -- in the application of intellectual capital.<br>(U//FOUO) Although our analysts are world-class, and are certainly the pre-eminent experts in<br>SIGINT analysis, there is important expertise outside the production chain. This is not news, but<br>I realize that there is an uneven understanding across the analytic enterprise regarding what is<br>or is not permissable in sharing information during the analytic process. In an attempt to level<br>the playing field, I have developed (with a lot of help from <br>, <br> and <br> an "Information Sharing Card" to distill what I consider to be the fundamentals. We will be<br>making wide distribution in hard copy, but you can find it on the web .<br>(U//FOUO) The Director and Chief of SID have endorsed. We hope that analysts throughout the<br>enterprise will feel empowered to engage freely in responsible collaboration, but we know the<br>policy people have work to do to address the issues more fully. A&amp;P Ops Staff will also follow up<br>with focus groups and other activities to roll out these ideas and principles more<br>comprehensively.<br>(U//FOUO) Please keep in mind that as we serve the nation, our obligations are to protect the<br>4th Amendment rights of US persons, to protect our sources and methods, and to protect the<br>integrity of our discipline. As stated on the card, I trust our analysts to make good decisions.<br>(U//FOUO) I hope the card will be useful.
