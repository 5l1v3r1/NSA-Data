Internet/Cyber EDA - FY 11/12

• Attempt to identify malicious sites in the HTTP graph

-	"BadRank- given set of known “bad” web sites, can we identify
associated sites that either point in same direction, or are reached
from initial sites

-	Identify loosely connected components - bits that aren’t closely
tied in by association with Google et al.

-	Subgraph detection - if we have an approximate idea of how a user

reaches a malicious web site, can we identify this pattern and
similar others in the HTTP graph? [	SANDIA work]
