DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Status of the DSOC<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 03/03/2004<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA <br>Signals Intelligence Director <br>(S) Last summer, the Director announced the creation of the Denver Security Operations<br>Center, or DSOC. (See the DIRgram .) I'd like to give you some background on this decision, and<br>let you know where we stand as of now.<br>(S//SI) For some years, NSA has realized the potential benefits of creating a TechSIGINT center<br>in Denver, but it is only recently that the time has been right to proceed. Consider these factors:<br>SID needs to modernize its TechSIGINT (especially ELINT) capabilities. The best way to do this<br>is by forming an analytic center of excellence to focus on this problem.<br>Why put it in Denver? We can achieve greater synergy by collocating SID's analytic functions<br>and Denver's recently consolidated collection functions in a single location. Furthermore, outside<br>of Ft. Meade, our largest concentration of TechSIGINT analysts is already based in Denver, so<br>the move makes sense logistically.<br>Since our TechSIGINT expertise will reside mainly in Denver, we have decided that Denver is<br>the logical choice for leading this discipline worldwide.<br>In the past, NSA headquarters and field office operations have not been fully integrated. The<br>Director has challenged us to implement Transformation 2.0 by operating as a globally<br>networked system. The stand-up of the DSOC will be a big step in that direction. Also, lessons<br>we learn now in tying together HQ elements and those in Denver will benefit us in future such<br>endeavors we may undertake.<br>At one time, the technology did not exist that would allow HQ elements and field elements to<br>collaborate seamlessly. With existing advances in communications and technology, that is no<br>longer the case.<br>The events of 9/11 have underscored the need to avoid having "all of our eggs in the same<br>basket" regarding our analytic and technical capabilities. By dispersing our capabilities, the<br>SIGINT system can continue to operate even if work is disrupted at NSA by a threat or other<br>incident.<br>(S) What is the net result of the creation of DSOC? Denver will continue its traditional mission,<br>but it will take on the added role of being the primary analytic center for TechSIGINT, as well as<br>the overall headquarters for coordinating TechSIGINT worldwide. This endeavor will mark a<br>milestone in integrating and networking our SIGINT system globally.<br>(S) In terms of governance, the Chief of DSOC will coordinate all efforts on behalf of the SIGINT<br>Director (me). His/her subordinates will report to the three SID Deputy Directors (for Customer<br>Relationships, Analysis &amp; Production, and Data Acquisition), as appropriate to their function.<br>(S//SI) Where do we stand now? Our TechSIGINT capabilities continue to transition to Denver,<br>and I believe that things are going well. I hope that you will join me in welcoming the standup of<br>the DSOC, and look forward to the benefits this effort will contribute to the whole SIGINT<br>system.
