DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Shadowing the Chief of Staff<br>FROM:<br>Pakistan Branch (S2A42)<br>Run Date: 04/22/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>Pakistan Branch (S2A42) <br>(U//FOUO) I recently had the opportunity to spend a day shadowing the SID Chief of Staff,<br>Charles Berlin. The experience was great, and it allowed me a brief glimpse of the way our<br>leadership is tackling the strategic issues facing the Agency.<br>(U//FOUO) In one day, we covered promotions, racial diversity, compensation reform, hiring<br>decisions, the evolving situation in Iraq, congressional queries, the impact of a major water leak<br>in one of the big four buildings, the question of how managers can better manage overtime to<br>ensure that we have a well-rested and healthy work force, and a restructuring of the SID staff.<br>According to Mr. Berlin, this was a "light" day.<br>(U//FOUO) We had meeting after meeting, with literally just minutes or seconds between most<br>commitments. It was an incredibly hectic pace, and it was amazing to see how quickly and<br>adeptly Mr. Berlin was able to shift gears. His executive assistant, Brenda Krasnodemski, was<br>always there when we had a free moment, getting Mr. Berlin's decisions on a never ending list of<br>actions. I learned that she makes every second of his time count!! His executive secretary,<br> was also busy juggling meeting after meeting on Mr. Berlin's calendar. Even in<br>such a face-paced and stressful environment, the three of them manage to maintain a sense of<br>humor and they all bent over backwards to make me feel welcome.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Berlin also made it a priority to find time for the two of us to chat, one-on-one,<br>and he was very willing to give me frank answers to my questions. He made the day extremely<br>interactive, asking for my input and ideas on several of the decisions he was making.<br>(U//FOUO) The shadowing program brought a new dimension to the many issues that we often<br>only read about. I highly recommend it!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
