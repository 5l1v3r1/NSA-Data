HTTP Parser

The HTTP Parser query looks for web activity (remember, HTTP = web) on a particular
link. This query is useful for several reasons. Firstly, if you know a particular website and
want to see if a foreign target visits it (e.g. an extremist web forum URL, or
maps.google.com). Secondly, this query enables you to query on a network IP(s),
casenotation, or country and see what websites we don't know about (survey-type query).

for everyone in Sweden that visits a particular extremist web forum.
