Background

1.	The EU-US TFTP Agreement from 2010 contains detailed provisions that allow for
transfer of SWIFT data to the US authorities (US Department of Treasury) for the
fight against terrorism or terrorist financing. Allegations appeared in recent news
reports (TV Globo, Der Spiegel) that the NSA has been tapping into personal
financial data from the SWIFT database. Europol has been given the task to verify
whether the requests of the US authorities comply with the terms of the
Agreement. This condition was one of the reasons for the European Parliament to
approve this Agreement after it rejected the previous one. Commissioner
Malmström wrote on 12 September to US Under Secretary Cohen, urgently asking
for clarifications. Session I will debate this issue.

2.	Session II will discuss the outcome of the second meeting of EU-US Transatlantic
group of experts on data protection of 19/20 September 2013.

3.	The Inquiry will start receiving feedback from US Civil Society (Part I - Session
III).

4.	Session IV will concentrate on Effectiveness of surveillance in fighting crime and
terrorism in Europe

5.	A study commissioned by the LIBE Committee to the Policy Department on “The
US National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programmes (PRISM) and Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) activities and their impact on EU citizens'
fundamental rights ” will be presented in Session V.

In light of the recent PRISM-related revelations, this briefing note analyses the
impact of US surveillance programmes on European citizens' rights. The note
explores the scope of surveillance that can be carried out under the US FISA
Amendment Act 2008, and related practices of the US authorities which have very
strong implications for EU data sovereignty and the protection of European
citizens' rights.
