Through the<br>herculean efforts of a dedicated group of professionals both in the Washington D.C. area and in<br>Denver, four key documents were created to act as a foundation for how the DSOC will operate,<br>and how it will govern the extended Technical SIGINT enterprise and work with its partners in<br>Denver. In April a manpower review team validated 445 positions in the DSOC. Most of the key<br>leadership positions have been filled.

Invitations to integrate into<br>the DSOC have gone out to our mission partners both here and abroad. GCHQ has already made<br>a commitment to send integrees. DIA's Missile and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC) and the<br>National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) are both committed to sending personnel to<br>work in the DSOC. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is already embedded in<br>the DSOC and looking to expand its support.<br>(S) The Director's vision of creating a Technical SIGINT Center of Excellence in Denver to<br>manage the Global Enterprise is well on its way to becoming a reality.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
