(Months, That Is...)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 03/31/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>Unknown <br>(U//FOUO) Today marks SID today 's first anniversary. To commemorate the occasion, we have<br>mined our SID today archives for some of the more memorable quotes that have appeared over<br>the last year. A retrospective, of sorts. Half will appear today, and the rest tomorrow. Also, we'd<br>like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed to SID today , whether<br>through submitting an article, providing feedback, or simply reading the webpage on a regular<br>basis. We look forward to an even better Year Two!<br>From: Maureen Baginski <br>Signals Intelligence Director <br>Thursday, April 03, 2003<br>(U//FOUO) Soon there will be a press report announcing my appointment as the FBI's Director of<br>Intelligence. I assume that post in May as an FBI employee.<br>From: SIGINT Communications <br>Friday, April 4, 2003<br>(U) "...I believe that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is the most powerful espionage<br>agency and that it rules the world at the moment, because it is capable of achieving total<br>surveillance of our planet and implementing a strategy of total espionage." <br>--Description of Source: Belgrade Nedeljni Telegraf in Serbo-Croatian<br>From: SIGINT Communications <br>Thursday, April 10, 2003<br>(U) Yesterday, Lt Gen Hayden announced the selection of Major General Richard Quirk III, USA,<br>as the new Signals Intelligence Director. Charlie Meals, currently Chief of the SID Customer<br>Relationships Directorate, will serve as MG Quirk's deputy.<br>From: The Iraq Issue Managers <br>Friday, April 11, 2003<br>(TS//SI) At a time when much of the workforce is focused on enabling a successful outcome for<br>coalition forces in Iraq, a small team of experts is developing the post-war Iraq plan. As complex<br>and demanding as the combat environment will be, the transition to peace; the elimination of<br>Iraq's ability to threaten the U.S. and its allies; and the restoration of a civil government will<br>likely be the longest and potentially most demanding engagement in this campaign.<br>From: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA <br>Signals Intelligence Director <br>Monday, June 16, 2003<br>(S) ...we must ensure that we sustain the right focus on Iraq and the issues attendant to that<br>challenge. The success that was achieved at a cost to so many could be lost if we let our<br>vigilance slip during this crucial period. I urge my leadership team, the Issue Managers, the<br><br> </p>Phase IV planning team and the Functional Leads to redouble their efforts to maintain the<br>necessary focus and attention to our role in enabling the peace.<br>From:<br> <br>Deputy Chief, NSA/CSS Japan Representative Okinawa <br>Thursday, June 19, 2003<br>(U//FOUO) What's SIGINT doing in a place like this?!? It's making a difference, every day. That's<br>what!<br>From: Colonel <br> <br>Chief, National Tactical Integration Office <br>Wednesday, July 09, 2003<br>(U) NSA is truly a national treasure...not because of its technology... but because of its people.<br>It has been my great honor to serve with you all! Farewell, God Bless America, and...stay In The<br>Fight!<br>From:<br>Chief, CSG Joint Staff (at the Pentagon) <br>Thursday, July 17, 2003<br>(U) What's so exciting about being here? Well, we often see issues we've worked on being<br>discussed later on TV by the Secretary of Defense. And like Forrest Gump, I occasionally just<br>happen to show up in areas where big-name people are passing by, such as Gen. Tommy<br>Franks and (gasp!) Brit Hume.<br>From:<br> <br>Interim Civilian Executive Assistant/SIGINT Director <br>Friday, July 18, 2003<br>(U//FOUO) "Life, as we know it, will cease to exist if I don't see MG Quirk immediately." As MG<br>Quirk's executive assistant, this is one of the many dramatic opening lines that I've heard.<br>From:<br> <br>NIST Coalition Provisional Authority - Baghdad <br>Wednesday, July 30, 2003<br>(S) Since this is known as the "world's most dangerous road" we try to spend as little time on it<br>as possible. That means not staying in the same place for any period of time and pushing our<br>Chevy Suburban to 110 mph.<br>From Charles H. Berlin III <br>SID Chief of Staff <br>Thursday, August 21, 2003<br>(U) Here's the last lesson: you work with and around the best people in the world - they have<br>courage, heart and compassion. Consider yourself lucky, cherish this idea and remember it is a<br>privilege to lead Americans with a mission like ours. As a leader you will necessarily have to<br>judge performance and behavior, but you need not judge your teammates as people - it has<br>already been established: they're the best.<br>(U) Watch for the conclusion tomorrow!<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
