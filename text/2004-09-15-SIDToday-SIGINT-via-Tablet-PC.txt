DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S) SIGINT via Tablet PC?<br>FROM: <br>Tools and Techniques (S122)<br>Run Date: 09/15/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) S122 is working hard to transform the way NSA disseminates information to its<br>customers. For instance, we are looking into ways to improve the delivery of product reports to<br>customers at external locations. Currently, GAMMA and other categories of SIGINT reports<br>require manual handling -- on-site NSA representatives select, print and hand-deliver the<br>products of interest to their customers. This process is labor-intensive and, since it is paperbased, precludes the use of computer-based tools to sort or analyze the information.<br>(U//FOUO) How can we do better? We are researching hardware, a Tablet PC, to allow nonNSAnet customers to securely and electronically view classified NSA product reports -- except<br>special series -- from their external locations. The Tablet PC is a portable computer, similar in<br>size and shape to a laptop screen, which allows a user to navigate files using a stylus on the<br>Tablet's touch screen.<br>(U//FOUO) Through the NCRDEF* office, S122 delivered Tablet PC's to several significant NSA<br>customers at the Pentagon to explore the feasibility of this type of electronic dissemination. In<br>the prototype, the NCRDEF account representatives bulk-copied the daily reports to a USB* flash<br>drive. The USB drive was then delivered to the customers who inserted the media device into<br>their Tablet PC; their requested reports opened automatically for viewing in priority order.<br>Electronic delivery of product reports allows customers to quickly and accurately search their<br>voluminous data for keywords relating to the current hot topic and also promises to provide<br>multimedia capabilities, timeliness, security and metrics to detail which reports have been most<br>valuable to our customers.<br>(U//FOUO) Much security and policy work remains to be done. S122 is working with IAD's SME<br>(Secure Mobile Environment) IPT* to address the challenging technical issues involved with<br>securing a computing device so that it will remain unclassified after having been exposed to<br>classified data. In the future, it may be possible to disseminate SIGINT reporting wirelessly to<br>these "SIGINT viewing devices," as well. We'll keep you posted as we reach major milestones in<br>this project!<br>(U//FOUO) If you have questions about this topic, contact <br>or phone <br>.<br><br> at <br><br>@nsa,<br><br>*(U) Notes: <br>NCRDEF = NSA/CSS Representative Defense <br>USB = Universal Serial Bus <br>IPT = Integrated Process Team <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
