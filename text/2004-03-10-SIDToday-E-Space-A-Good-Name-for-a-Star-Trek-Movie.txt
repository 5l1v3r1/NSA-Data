Many haven't. Yet<br>it is an important, ongoing initiative nestled in the Customer Relationships Directorate (S1)<br>whose purpose is to stand up an E-Space Analysis Center in support of electronic warfare (EW)<br>operators, planners, and developers. The program office took shape in August 2002, following<br>guidance from what is now the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD<br>(I)). It gained newfound prominence with the 30 October 2003 publication of SECDEF's<br>Information Operations Roadmap, which states that the E-Space Analysis Center should be<br>DoD's focal point for intelligence support to EW .<br>(U//FOUO) One of its primary goals is to provide integrated, full-spectrum views of an<br>adversary's electromagnetic space to enable the development of capabilities and operational<br>courses of action to support Information Operations (IO). A key aspect of this effort is to afford<br>ready access to integrated EW database information via JWICS and SIPRNET portals.<br>(U//FOUO) Steady progress has been made over the past year and a half, with prototype<br>development well underway and the selection of a prime development contractor, Booz-AllenHamilton, in September 2003. To stay connected with the end customer, the program office<br>recently concluded two days of meetings with EW community subject-matter experts. The<br>standing E-Space Integrated Product Team (IPT) met the first day to elicit user feedback on the<br>development system (Spiral 1A). Day two consisted of a hands-on demonstration and system<br>familiarization for designated beta test site representatives. Not all locations were able to<br>participate, but actual beta testing will entail sending a contractor support team to the sites<br>listed below in the March/April 2004 timeframe:<br>USSTRATCOM<br>USSOCOM<br>USPACOM<br>NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center)<br>JWAC (Joint Warfare Analysis Center)<br>NAWC (Naval Air Warfare Center)<br>Air Force's 53rd EW Wing<br>Air Force's 453rd EW Squadron<br>(U//FOUO) The operational capability for Spiral 1B (certified and accredited) is set for late<br>September 2004, at which point all potential users will be able to access the E-Space portals.<br>This initial effort will allow single-sign-on access to roughly a dozen NSA and non-NSA EWrelated databases and an ability to query across multiple databases. Rollout of Spiral 2 is<br>anticipated in June 2005. Among other enhancements, Spiral 2 will include access to additional<br>databases, expanded query capabilities, data visualization tools, and integrated access to opensource reference data. In the meantime, the program office will continue to interact and<br>dialogue with EW users and producers to optimize in-formation exchange and ensure<br>development of a system that meets the intended purpose.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on E-Space, visit our Webworld site or contact Col.<br>USAF, E-Space Program Manager, S1E,<br>, <br>or<br> Titan SETA Contractor,<br>E-Space Program Management Office (S1E)<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
