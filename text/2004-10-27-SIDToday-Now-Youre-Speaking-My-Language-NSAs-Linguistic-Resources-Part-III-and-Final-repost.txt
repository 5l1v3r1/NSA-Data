Good language readiness metrics are dependent<br>upon good testing mechanisms. The DCI Community Management Staff (CMS) is now sponsoring<br>the development by DLI of brand new computer-delivered language tests that will assess level<br>0+ through 4 in listening and reading. The first ten computer-delivered tests will be ready in the<br>fall of 2005, with more to follow. For the first time, there will be a single, reliable testing metric<br>for civilians and military across DoD.<br>(U//FOUO) Training through LangNet -- Multilingual Advanced Learning on-Line . The<br>first release of the LangNet-MALL system is now available on NSAnet to help analysts maintain<br>or improve their reading skills in Modern Standard Arabic, Chechen, Chinese, Hindi, Kurdish<br>(Sorani), Pashto, Persian Farsi, Spanish, Turkmen, Urdu, Uzbek or West Punjabi (with more<br>languages to be added). It provides instruction at the higher proficiency levels and in the LessCommonly-Taught Languages.<br>(C) "Backfill" billets to attain/sustain 3/3 . With ops tempo ever increasing, CLAs often<br>cannot be spared to go to language training. Thus, the vicious cycle is perpetuated. CLAs at 3/3<br>usually cannot be released for training to higher levels. The 75% of the military CLAs and the<br>49% of the civilians who are not at level 3/3 stay on position, rather than going to training to<br>improve their skills and their job performance. In order for CLAs to go to training, there must be<br>additional personnel who can "backfill" for their colleagues, i.e. replace them on position.<br>(S) NSA/CSS Action to Date: NSA/CSS has increased its civilian hiring ceiling by 600<br>linguists over the next five years to "backfill" for civilian language analysts. With a<br>current civilian cadre of nearly 1200, this represents an overall net gain of 50%.<br>Additionally, NSA/CSS has launched an aggressive hiring program to include as many<br>heritage (near native) and native speakers as possible and to appeal to such populations<br>as language professors at prestigious universities.<br>(U//FOUO) Further Action Required: The military CLA manning factor must similarly be<br>increased to allow military language analysts to go to the maintenance and enhancement<br>training required for their jobs. NSA/CSS recommends that the number of military<br>language billets be raised by 785 billets. This recommendation, along with the DLI<br>increased funding recommendation, is now in the final approval stages by DoD's Joint<br>Requirements Oversight Council.<br>(U//FOUO) Increase Foreign Language Incentive Pay (FLIP) and/or incentives .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
