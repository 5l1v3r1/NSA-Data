DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Chef's Choice: SIGINT and the Question of Governance<br>FROM: Charlie Meals<br>Signals Intelligence Deputy Director<br>Run Date: 05/05/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) By now, you are all aware that the Director wants us to make significant changes to<br>the way NSA operates. (See related article .) His vision has us operating as a worldwide<br>organization with headquarters and extended enterprise functions being performed without<br>necessarily linking them to a location. For the purpose of this note, we will simply refer to these<br>functions as "governance." I'd like to let you know how we envision the new model working for<br>the SIGINT Directorate at this time, and our thoughts on roles that will be exercised at Ft Meade<br>and in the rest of the Extended Enterprise. By Extended Enterprise, I mean all elements of the<br>U.S. Cryptologic System, wherever they may be in the world.<br>(U//FOUO) When you look at the whole of our worldwide enterprise, the complexity of the<br>SIGINT System (USSS) is an amazing thing. There are few enterprises anywhere that bring<br>together such a diverse array of vocations (cryptography, language analysis, liaison work, just<br>to name a few) ... and on top of that, we ply our trades literally all over the globe! Deserved or<br>not, NSA has a reputation for being an enormously effective but not terribly efficient<br>organization. By adopting and nurturing the Director's vision, we hope to significantly improve<br>our effectiveness and move toward garnering the same sort of reputation for our efficiency.<br>(U//FOUO) While the SIGINT Directorate has always implemented the Director's operational<br>control over the entire USSS, it has historically focused the lion's share of its attention on NSAW<br>and, as a result, the USSS has failed to operate as effectively and efficiently as it might in<br>accomplishing its mission. Effectively and efficiently managing the entire enterprise as a unified<br>whole is the desired end state towards which we will be working. Our business has become so<br>complex and interdependent that we can no longer allow it to operate as separate entities. The<br>distinction between national and theater as well as strategic and tactical is increasingly<br>meaningless and we will work hard to ensure that the corporation is managed in accordance<br>with that in mind.<br>(U//FOUO) Both the headquarters and the extended enterprise have long produced outstanding<br>SIGINT as virtually separate entities. The time has now come for us to operate as a global,<br>wholly integrated network and fully exploit the latent power our failure to function as a unified<br>whole has denied us. To get this right, both headquarters and the remote elements must each<br>carry out the role for which it is best suited and seek opportunities to create and nurture<br>synergy.<br>(U//FOUO) What are those roles? The SIGINT Director will function primarily as the CEO of the<br>SID, responsible for SIGINT issues worldwide. He will provide the overarching intent, assign<br>missions, and provide guidance on SIGINT issues to the entire USSS. Operational elements,<br>regardless of location, will execute the mission. Furthermore, detached elements will feed back<br>unique information and insights to Headquarters, to help them make the right decisions.<br>(U//FOUO) We recognize that two-way communication and a collegial, cooperative attitude will<br>be key. We should have the attitude that a good idea can originate anywhere, and we must take<br>advantage of it. This means that we all will be doing much more coordination with people in<br>distant locations than we once did. It is important that those in the field not be disadvantaged<br>by a lack of access to the SIGINT Director or his leadership team, once again, wherever they are<br>located. They need to be able to participate in town meetings virtually, see/display viewgraphs<br>via computer, and in general have the connectivity to be fully engaged.<br>(U//FOUO) Although the technology already exists to communicate in this way, we need<br>additional IT capacity that can handle the scale and scope we require. It is also true that there<br>are times when nothing can replace a face-to-face meeting, so SID needs to allocate enough<br><br> </p>TDY money so that personnel can get together when they ought to do so. We will need not only<br>more money but also more managers and leaders who focus on the entire network. If necessary<br>we will adjust our priorities, but we cannot fail if we are to truly take SIGINT to the next level.<br>(U//FOUO) SID Governance is about everyone fully understanding the Director's intent and the<br>missions assigned, and working together as a unified whole to execute those missions in a<br>manner which ensure that America has ubiquitous information superiority. It's about<br>collaboration, constant interaction, and synchronization of all components regardless of location.<br>Most important of all, I think, is that we in the SIGINT Enterprise, and especially its leadership,<br>think differently about how we do business. When we make "SIGINT a team sport" our state of<br>mind, the rest will follow.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
