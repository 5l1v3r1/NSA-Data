"Advanced" CNE<br>refers to operations in Category B (vulnerability scanning) and above. This new capability at<br>KRSOC will not only expand CNE operations for NSA/CSS, it will also serve as the first step in<br>providing TAO with CNE Continuity of Operations (COOP) - that is, the ability to continue<br>essential missions and functions without unacceptable interruption when catastrophes or other<br>major disruptions occur.<br>(U//FOUO) COOP for CNE<br>(U//FOUO) COOP operations involve taking preparatory measures, responding to events, and<br>restoring capabilities, all part of a readiness and survivability program. SID/TAO has developed<br>plans for COOP consistent with the guiding principles of the Mission Assurance Program Office<br>(DK2), which promote a dispersal of resources (including personnel), minimize duplication of<br>capabilities, and support a seamless transition in the event of a disaster. Sufficient equipment<br>has been installed at KRSOC to ensure continuity of some operations, and this initiative is<br>expected to evolve to include additional sustained operations in the future.<br>(TS//SI) In the long term, we expect to be able to reconstitute operations from Category A<br>through D (i.e. "target mapping" through "sustained SIGINT collection") at additional alternate<br>facilities, in case of either temporary or permanent interruptions in service. For these plans to be<br>successful, we will need a robust on-net infrastructure. The USSID 222 Implementation Plan<br>(USSID 222 IP) calls for several alternative facilities - expected to be located at all three RSOCs<br>- to be manned by trained and certified operators to complement TAO's Remote Operations<br>Center (ROC) facilities and personnel.<br>(U) Background<br>(S) The CNE Strategic Plan of August 1997 serves as the basis for the combined efforts of the<br>SCEs and NSA to integrate the CNE process into daily SIGINT operations. The initial efforts at<br>the Kunia, Medina and Ft. Gordon RSOCs have been non-intrusive target development (Category<br>A). However, as RSOC CNE capabilities evolve exploitation responsibilities will increasingly<br>migrate to the RSOCs for their respective target sets, as delegated by TAO. Both the MRSOC and<br>GRSOC are scheduled to receive advanced CNE capabilities in the near future.<br>(S) We see exciting times ahead for those involved in the CNE field - the global use of network<br>and digital technology offers great opportunities for the SIGINT Enterprise.<br>(S) The KRSOC had their ribbon cutting ceremony for advanced CNE operations on 16 March<br>2004.<br>(U//FOUO) The point of contact for this issue at TAO is CWO3<br><br> or LTJG<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
