Up Front Caveat

Before we begin this briefing, I want to set the
stage by saying that there is no silver bullet for
tracking target communications through
anonymizers. Any methodology set forth in this
briefing requires both manual analysis and
(generally) luck.

With that out of the way...

The issue at hand...(proxies,
anonymizers &Tor. oh my!)

Targets generally don’t like to have their
communications tracked by government
agencies or filtered by national firewalls.

If they are tech-sawy enough, they will use
anonymizers to try to mask their real IP/
location.

This generally makes for sad analysts. ©

What we do about the issue at

hand...

The only way to track communications through anonymizers is
if you understand how those anonymizers work. If you don’t
know what the traffic looks like, how will you recognize it in
SIGINT?

Generally our process is as follows:

■	Identify new proxy/anonymizer

■	Research/use anonymizer, document what happens, what does traffic look
like, what client traffic does it pass through(if any)?

■	Create fingerprints in SIGINT to identify such proxy traffic

■	Correlate proxy traffic with known target activity

Anchorfree

AnchorFree owns a bunch of servers on
the Internet.

Then you have a user

From testing, the IP address that the user connects to,
and the IP they show up as are NOT the same. But
there is a direct correlation between the two.

AnchorFree....so what?

We can build static mappings
between the inside/tunnel IP
address and the IP they show
up as...

So when we see a target access
their account from an
AnchorFree IR we know which IP
to go look for tunnel connections
to in orderto find their real client
IP address...

We can also write XKS
fingerprints to look for
AnchorFree tunnels en masse
from interesting locations.

Tor

I) the user selects 3 relatively random Tor nodes to use.

Tor

1)	the user selects 3 relatively random Tor nodes to use.

2)	The user then sets up layers of SSL tunnels through them all to get to
facebook. A layer is stripped off along each hop.

Interesting tidbits aboutTor

TOR uses SSL tunnels for encryption, we are
able to identify what their SSL certificates look
like (which allows us to identify Tor circuits in
SIGINT).

And now for something completely

different...

A lot of research we do on anonymizers
consists of open source research:

■	The Intewvebz (forums, RFC's, 2010 Circumvention
Tool Usage Report, etc)

■	Trial and Error /Wireshark

■	Basically RTFM’ing about how stuff works and
translating that to the SIGINT system.
