DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Bringing Target Templating Tools to Analysts<br>FROM: SIGINT Development - Strategy and Governance (SSG)<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/06/2004<br><br>This is the follow-up to the recent article Target Templating -- The Way Ahead (U)<br>(S//SI) SIGINT Development is predominantly the anticipation and discovery of unknowns -unknown targets, unknown signals, yet-to-be-detected target activity, etc. Target Templating is<br>a unifying framework for conducting SIGINT Development. In this article, we will discuss what<br>SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is doing in the near and long term to<br>bring Target Templating tools to analysts.<br>(C) The graphic of the nine-layer Target Templating model may already be familiar to you. SSG<br>has converted this model into a business process diagram that identifies the participants in<br>Target Templating and their role in the Templating process. This process embodies the goals of<br>Transformation 2.0 by showing how our IC/Academic/Industry/Cryptologic Partners, AP and DA<br>personnel, and IAD contribute to the Templating process. Using the diagram as a model for the<br>future of Templating, the Target Templating Implementation Strategy identifies four vectors for<br>making Templating an integral part of Sustained Mission, as well as SIGINT Development. In this<br>article, we focus on the Enabling Technology vector.<br>(S//SI) The Enabling Technology vector addresses how to integrate information from various<br>databases to visualize and automatically update a Target Template. SSG has partnered with<br>Information Visualization in Technology Services , the Social Network Analysis Center (SNAW),<br>the Knowledge System Prototype (KSP) program, the Target Analysis Center (TAC) and the<br>Network Analysis Center (NAC), to develop a prototype in RENOIR that queries the KSP and<br>displays data that visually correlates social networks, communications events and logical and<br>physical communications networks.<br>(S//SI) When fully developed, this tool will be interoperable with SNAW tools for detailed<br>analysis of social networks, communications event tools for detailed analysis of communications<br>events and NAC tools for detailed analysis of communications networks, including vendor<br>components and network vulnerabilities, thus visualizing the top four layers of the Target<br>Template (Target Domain, Supporting Infrastructure, Technology, Vulnerabilities). SSG expects<br>the initial prototype to be completed in 2005. In the following two years,, the prototype will<br>address the next five layers of the Template (Capabilities, Access, Results, Decision, Execution)<br>in order to link communications networks to access and collection affecting a given target.<br><br>(S//SI) Through ongoing collaboration with systems engineers and solution developers, SSG will<br>ensure the Target Template prototype does not become just an SRTD documentation tool, but a<br>corporate software service to analysts, access developers, global event and collection managers<br>and others who require an automatic, synthesized, up-to-date picture of target activity and the<br>SIGINT opportunities available/under way against a particular target.<br>(U) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is also working with a number of<br>organizations to bring Target Templating tools to analysts in the near term as other Templating<br>tool development efforts move from prototypes into mature systems. CmapTools is being used<br>as an interim tool.<br>(U) CmapTools is a concept modeling tool that supports the capture, presentation, enhancement<br>and analysis of knowledge in an interactive graphical display. Based on over 40 years of<br>cognitive research, CmapTools has caught the attention of many organizations and programs.<br><br> </p>SSG recognized its suitability as an interim Target Templating tool for capturing and modeling<br>Target Templates. One goal in using CmapTools is to construct a sharable Target Template that<br>captures what is known and unknown about current and potential targets, facilitating the<br>systematic examination of knowledge gaps at every layer of the Template.<br>(U) A second goal in using CmapTools is to develop a corporate memory ; what have I<br>learned about Target A that can be applied to Targets B, H, and T? What parts of the Target<br>Template for Target A can I reuse when starting to build a Template for Target C? How easy it is<br>to link/reuse this knowledge in other Templates? The strength of CmapTools is its graphical<br>depiction of knowledge in the form of concepts (boxes) and the relationships (links) between<br>them, generating visualizations (concept maps) that can be more quickly comprehended than<br>text.<br>(U) Concept maps (Cmaps) can be linked in order to drill from target knowledge, down into<br>exploitation opportunities, collection tasks, and lessons learned from the templating process. In<br>this way Templates can be interlinked, showing relationships between targets and target<br>development issues/solutions. A series of inter-connected cmaps, representing layers of the<br>Target Template, can be used in a number of ways. Analysts, new to a target office can use the<br>cmaps to come up to speed on a target.<br>(U) Product lines working on overlapping target issues can pool their target and SIGINT<br>knowledge into sharable cmaps, facilitating joint assessment of critical areas for target<br>development, target issues that require additional resources and forms of gap analysis. Analysts<br>can also link reports, graphics, spreadsheets, hyperlinks and other documents to a concept on a<br>cmap. Cmaps are exportable in HTML and XML formats, so they can be viewed from a web page<br>( see example ). CmapTools is also part of the Analysis &amp; Production Analytic Tool Strategy<br>(APATS). Persons interested in CmapTools can contact <br> (<br>), Technical<br>Leader, SIGDEV Learning Portal.<br>(U) For information on the Target Templating Implementation Strategy, please contact <br> <br>), Technical Leader, Operations Orchestration Portfolio in SSG.
