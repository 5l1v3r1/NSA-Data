However, there are many lessons, both negative and positive,<br>that can be derived from previous nation-building experiences -- and we ignore them to our peril<br>and that of the countries we are trying to help. This session will scope out the meaning of nationbuilding and how it differs from mere peacekeeping, explore U.S. and UN experiences in postconflict reconstruction, point out the common denominators in successful and unsuccessful<br>nation-building, and connect the lessons-learned to what the U.S. is currently trying to<br>accomplish in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br>(U) Please consult the SINIO website for more information on future events in this series.<br>POCs: <br>Marilyn Maines, for SINIO Council (<br>) <br>for National Cryptologic School (<br> <br>For information on the first session, please contact SINIO for Global and Multilateral Issues<br>) <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
