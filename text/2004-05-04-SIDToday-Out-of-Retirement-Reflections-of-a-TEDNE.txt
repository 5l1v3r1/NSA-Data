DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Out of Retirement: Reflections of a TEDNE<br>FROM:<br>Western Europe and Strategic Partnerships Division (S2C3)<br>Run Date: 05/04/2004<br>FROM: <br>Western Europe and Strategic Partnerships Division (S2C3) <br>(U) As I handed my badge to the very courteous British guard at the main gate of the<br>Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, England on 31 December<br>1997, I knew that once I left the compound it would mark the end of a wonderful 28-year career<br>with the National Security Agency. My husband had come to GCHQ for a 3-year posting, and I<br>had accompanied him, working as an integree for several months. This was a fabulous<br>experience that I will always recall with great fondness. Therefore, the decision to take<br>advantage of the Agency's early retirement scheme was not made easily.<br>(U) Nonetheless, having made the decision, I proceeded as planned. Leaving the GCHQ<br>compound, I reflected happily on many years of exciting, rewarding job assignments, unique<br>opportunities afforded to me through my Agency employment, and all the wonderful friends that<br>my husband and I had made over the years. So, it was with a feeling of happiness and<br>contentment that I began to settle into a life of genteel retirement, in the lovely spa town of<br>Cheltenham surrounded by the beautiful Cotswold hills.<br>(U) My husband and I returned to our home in Maryland in August, 2000. Shortly after our<br>return, my husband also retired from the Agency. In July, 2001, we celebrated our 30th<br>wedding anniversary and both delighted in living life on our own schedule. Who would have<br>known that the lives of all Americans would change so dramatically less than two months later.<br>(U) As I watched with horror the TV coverage of the terrorist attacks against innocent civilians in<br>America on September 11, 2001, my immediate reaction, like most Americans, was, "What can I<br>do to help?" Therefore, when I received a phone call from the Agency asking if I would consider<br>returning to work, the answer was immediate and it was positive. Without hesitation, I decided<br>to take a leave of absence from retirement.<br>(U//FOUO) During the course of my Agency career, I served in a variety of analytic, staff and<br>management assignments and was a Senior Group Coordinator in NSOC during Operation Desert<br>Storm. Returning to work in early 2002 as a Temporary Employee During the National<br>Emergency (TEDNE) , formerly the Civilian Cryptologic Reserve Program - CCRP, has allowed me<br>to return to my analytic roots.<br>(S) In my present assignment as a Senior Intelligence Analyst, I research, write, coordinate, and<br>release Summary Reports on a wide range of issues related to the Global War on Terrorism, the<br>Iraq and Afghan Campaigns, Proliferation of WMD, and issues related to Homeland Security. The<br>work, as always, is tremendously interesting and vitally important. Positive feedback from<br>customers on the Summary Reports also reinforces my sense of contributing to the Agency's<br>critical mission.<br>(U) My fellow analysts, reporters and managers have all been very supportive, and I thank them<br>for making the adjustment from retirement to work an easy one. I feel tremendously privileged<br>to have been able to return to assist the Agency during this time of national crisis, and I'm very<br>grateful that I can apply the target knowledge and experience that I gained over the years with<br>NSA to today's challenges.<br>(U) At my retirement party in England, I shared with the "younger" generation of intelligence<br>analysts that working for the National Security Agency and being associated with the<br>Intelligence Community was not just a job, but an adventure. Working as a TEDNE allows the<br>adventure to continue.<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
