Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the new mascot for the SID OPSEC<br>program. My name is ---- actually, let's talk first. What I have to talk about is much more<br>important than who I am, right? Recently my humans (a.k.a. the SID OPSEC Program<br>Managers) sponsored a briefing for SID personnel on the topic of Identity Theft. Just in time,<br>too! One of them got an email that very night from someone pretending to represent Citibank,<br>asking her to go to a website and type in her password. Can you imagine? Trying to "phish" for<br>information from someone who earns her living helping people keep their information secure!<br>How silly! Of course, nobody would ever try to steal my identity, although I'd like to see<br>someone try. I'd toast 'em!<br> <br>SID OPSEC Dragon <br>(U//FOUO) Anyway, we hope you enjoyed the Identity Theft presentation. We know that many<br>more people wanted to attend than we could accommodate, so we're working to schedule<br>additional presentations in the future. Work/Life services and Security also sponsor similar<br>events, as does TFCU, so hopefully everyone will have a chance to receive education on this<br>important topic soon. We'd love to hear your feedback from this session as well, so please email<br>your comments to<br>(U//FOUO) Now, on to what's really important. ME. I'd love to introduce myself, but, well, I<br>can't. One of my humans found me recently, but no one knows my name -- including me! They<br>tried to suggest various names to me hoping I'd remember who I was, but no luck. I don't want<br>to insult them, but frankly the names they suggested were pretty lame. I mean really, a<br>magnificent purple OPSEC dragon needs a dignified, regal name. Or at least one that people can<br>pronounce! It is getting tiresome being addressed as "Hey, Dragon!" though.<br>(U//FOUO) I think I finally hit on a solution. A name contest! Everyone in SID is encouraged to<br>participate. This is pretty important to me, so I'd like a lot of names to choose from. After all, I<br>am the new face of OPSEC in SID. That's a big responsibility. I need just the right name to<br>really make a statement. That's understandable, isn't it? So, here's the deal. You put on your<br>thinking cap and suggest a name or two. Send your suggestions to <br>@nsa and<br>@nsa before COB 13 October 2004. An exclusive panel of judges will review the<br>suggestions, and whoever submits the winning name will win a fabulous prize. Ok, so maybe not<br>fabulous, but you'll at least win a prize. So please, help me find a name soon!<br>Thank you, <br>Name unknown <br>The SID OPSEC Dragon <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p>DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
