BREAKING NEWS {May 2012]- The second tranche of 'deep dive' processing capabilitj,r at
RFC has gone live- In addition 2 extra lUE's are being processed at UPC- This brings the current
'deep dive' capabilitjq.r to:

- CPC with IE 1: lUg.
I UPC with lUg
I with 23 lUg-

This gives over 300 SCI-1Q and ~25i] NBA access to huge amounts of data to support the
target discover}r mission-

The MTI programme would like to saj,r a big thanks to everyone who has made this possible
{Which includes TEA. TEA. SSME. BEDS. GTE. ACD. OPP-LEE. IT Services. R1 at

NBA. AHS and a true collaborative effort!

capability to MISDIMCE communities-

I TEMFCRA is the codeword for internet buffer business capability as a whole which
is the ability to loosely promote a We oftraffic across SSE access into a repository
which will keep the content (and its associated metadata} for periods oftime (approximately
3 days for content and up to 30 days for metadata} to allow retrospective analysis and
forwarding to follow on systems-

. TEMFCRA as a capability is agnostic of the technologies used to promote that traffic and to
store that traffic and so should not be used as a codeword for the individual components (e-g
KKS- MVR etc}-

I At the moment the components include. amongst others. CCI-ICI SSE Access. FCKERFACE
sanitisation- RES (in various con?gurations} and it will include MEIR in the very near future-

I TEMFCRA also covers the management ofthe rules used to promote traffic into the internet
buffer capability-

I TEMFCRA is not processing centre speci?c- At the moment there are instances of
TEMFCRA at all (Namely CFC. CIFC and These should be referred to. when
required. as TEMFCRA
