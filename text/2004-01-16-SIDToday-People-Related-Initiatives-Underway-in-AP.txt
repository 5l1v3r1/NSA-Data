Although it is too soon for most of these actions to have<br>yielded meaningful results, I want you to know they are underway. The most significant are:<br>(U//FOUO) Strengthening the Intelligence Analysis career field : I have asked Deborah<br>Maklowski, our Senior Intelligence Authority, to develop an assessment/diagnostic tool for<br>Intelligence Analysis in order to increase our understanding of the technical health of analysts<br>and analysis. In a sense, it is an updating of the best aspects of what we formerly called<br>"professionalization." I have asked her to consider as a starting point the work done within our<br>Language Community under the leadership of Renee Meyer, Senior Language Authority, to<br>identify skill levels and link them to missions. Among the many outcomes for the Language Skill<br>Community, one of the most significant has been recognition that mission increasingly demands<br>3/3 language proficiency, which requires funding and other significant changes. From my<br>perspective, it allows for informed decisions about operational readiness, training and<br>professional development, and incentive pay, and from language analysts' perspective, it allows<br>them to better assess their strengths and weaknesses so that they can focus their development<br>efforts. It is absolutely clear to me that intelligence analysts across the board deserve similar<br>status. Deborah is only just beginning. This won't be easy, and the metrics won't be perfect, but<br>this will be important to the future of our discipline and those who practice it.<br>(U//FOUO) Managing space : The biggest surprise I've had since my return to NSA<br>Headquarters has been the severity of the space problem here. We have space problems other<br>places, too, as I saw and heard during my visit to GRSOC last week. I am distressed by the<br>conditions in which many of our people are working despite the best efforts of our partners in<br>I&amp;L . There are things we can do over time to alleviate the situation, but with a large number of<br>new people coming on board over the next couple of years; we are in a jam (literally). I have<br>asked <br> to work with Chiefs of Staff, SID staff, and I&amp;L to first try to define the<br>situation, now and as we expect it to unfold, and to develop options. I don't even know what a<br>miracle in this area would look like, but I'm not expecting one. We'll do what we can.<br>(U//FOUO) Strengthening team chiefs and branch chiefs : I have immense respect for those<br>who function as team chiefs and branch chiefs, even if those terms are not currently recognized<br>officially (I think they are now on the books as "technical leaders"). More than ever - especially<br>as we bring on board large numbers of new people - managers and leaders closest to the<br>mission and the people who perform it are vital to our success. Regardless of whether we can<br>restore the titles (we are engaging HR to try), I will work with NCS to provide the training and<br>with A&amp;P management to identify opportunities to help team and branch chiefs to do their jobs.<br>(U//FOUO) Implementing a Career Development Board (CDB) : I have decided that the Senior<br>Leadership Team will review all GG-15's and all division chief positions and above, to include<br>Technical Leaders, on a regular basis to ensure optimal utilization of talent within the<br>organization. My intention is to expand to include GG-14's as soon as practical. I would also like<br>to include people from outside A&amp;P, as appropriate, and ideally would like to work this as part of<br>a larger SID process. The purpose of the CDB is to remedy what has been previously a vacancybased process - people have been able to move into jobs mostly as a result of openings<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">occurring through natural processes, limiting our flexibility (which is especially debilitating for<br>people returning from the field). In order increase our flexibility and ensure movement through and thus experience in - certain positions, we might consider finite "tour lengths" for some<br>positions at headquarters. We also need a more rigorous mechanism for identifying candidates<br>for high-priority positions, schools, and developmental programs. As the name indicates, the<br>CDB has a direct bearing on careers, but I do not see it primarily as a personnel function. It is<br>rather a management function focused on organizational health.<br>(U//FOUO) Balancing slating and competitive announcements : As implied by the CDB, I am<br>comfortable with more slating than may have been the norm. It needs to be balanced, however,<br>with the right amount of competitive announcements that will elicit candidates and attract<br>people into A&amp;P. The "right amount" will be a judgment call - I have asked<br>Chief of Staff, to help me with guidelines. I have slated a number of people in my first few<br>months, partly because of the urgency of the situations. Everyone should be assured that<br>through a combination of CDB and competitive announcements, no one in A&amp;P will be without<br>opportunity for meaningful challenge and professional growth.<br>(U//FOUO) Strengthening the roles of Technical Directors (TD) and Technical Leaders (TL) :<br>One of the reasons that I oppose the change in titles of branch and team chiefs to "technical<br>leaders" is, of course, that we already have TD's and TL's. They are a vital part of our<br>organization and have made immense contributions on every front. Because I have been so<br>impressed by their knowledge, skill, insights, and creativity, I want to make sure we are making<br>best use of them. One obstacle to that, at least in my mind, is what I perceive as a lack of<br>definition with respect to titles, roles, and relationships. I certainly do not think we should force<br>rigid uniformity, but I do think it would be helpful to be clear in our terminology (e.g., TD vs. TL<br>vs technical expert) and in mutual expectations. Jack Israel, the A&amp;P Technical Director, has<br>taken the lead; you'll be seeing more on this soon.<br>(U//FOUO) That's a brief description of the most important things I've generated with respect to<br>people. You are the reason NSA is the envy of the world - I am conscious of my responsibilities<br>to you.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
