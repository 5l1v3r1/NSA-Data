tc meet with TAD leadership tc discuss current and future initiatiyes cf mutual
interest under the new relaticnship primary gcals fer the
partnership are:

and unique access tc ccmmunicaticns - e.g. al-Oa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula
(AOAP) terrcrist actiyity currently accessible by cther means, and

tc utilize SIGINT tc lccate and track indiyiduals cf mutual interest within Saudi
Arabia.

(U) Success Stcries

(SIISIHREL TO USA, SAU) with TAD en a sensitive access has
early prcmise in prcducing SIGINT cfyalue tc the CT prcduct line.

(SHSIHREL TO USA, SAU) A mcdernized HFDF senscr and HFDF antenna
system was installed in September 2012 at a MOD RRD lccaticn new Riyadh.
This FDF system replaces a legacy senscr that has been incperable an
extended pericd cftime and will signi?cantly regicnal HFDF
architecture.

(SHSIHREL TO USA, SAU) MOD RRD a Quick Reacticn Ca abilit
that dammed a?system? in

the Arabian Gulf in tc a pctential threat IRGC OO DS Maritime
Fcrce. A sustained ccllecticn is planned ent in May 2013.

 

(U) with the Partner

(SHSIHREL TO USA, FMEY) The MOD RRD wculd like tc mcye expediticusly in
their mcdernizaticn tc include the acquisiticn cf additicnal SIGINT
capabilities. NSAICSS is cauticusly mcying fcrward with this partner and is net
necessarily ready tc mcye fcrward with initiatives that expcse sensitiye NSAICSS
SIGINT equities. This difference in strategic directicn will scmetimes be

atic and cause tensicn within the partnership.

(SHEIHNF) NSAIOSS has agreed tc ccllecticn cperaticns in Saudi
Arabia with Chief cf Staticn cf Riyadh in an tc prctect unilateral HUMINT
assets scrutiny.

(TSHSIHNF) NSAIOSS dces expect the new relaticnship with TAD tc usurp cr
negatively impact existing relaticnship with the Ministry at Defense
Radic Fieccnnaissance Department (MOD RRD), as MOD dces have
similar access tc internal Saudi teleccmmunicaticns.
