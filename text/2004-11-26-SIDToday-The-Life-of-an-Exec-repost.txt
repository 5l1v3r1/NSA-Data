(U)<br>(U//FOUO) "Life, as we know it, will cease to exist if I don't see MG Quirk immediately." As MG<br>Quirk's executive assistant, this is one of the many dramatic opening lines that I've heard. An<br>exec is a senior leader's front door, traffic cop, information manager, and most importantly,<br>conscience. Like triage in an emergency room, an exec's main task is prioritization. Which of the<br>hundreds of incoming daily e-mails and documents are truly important? Out of the dozens of<br>requests, whom should they meet with today? What do they have to sign now so the Earth does<br>not spin off its axis? An exec must make hundreds of decisions every day to optimize the<br>senior's time. The worst decision is no decision. Without an effective filter, the senior is doomed<br>to drown in information overload and unending meetings.<br>(U//FOUO) What is a "typical" day in the life of an exec? Opening the office before the craziness<br>begins is critical as the exec must skim new incoming information and tee up the hot issues of<br>the day. Then the daily roller coaster ride begins. The exec will attend many of the back-toback-to-back meetings-- look for the slightly haggard individual sitting in the back row<br>documenting actions or going through volumes of paperwork. The exec must be prepared to<br>steal quality time with the senior between meetings or in transit to provide updates or<br>background on upcoming events. The churn of activity usually continues through the late<br>afternoon or early evening. The end of the day is often the only available time to work off<br>actions and complete paperwork.<br>(U//FOUO) Keeping pace with a frenetic schedule is only skimming the surface of being an exec.<br>An exec is a confidant who works significant and sensitive issues behind the scenes. They are<br>the senior's staunchest ally to the outside world but privately their toughest critic providing<br>candid assessments of decisions, meetings, and briefings. The exec represents the senior at all<br>times and must build positive relationships across the organization, particularly with the staffs of<br>other senior leaders. An exec makes sure promises are kept and questions are answered. An<br>exec is the voice inside the senior's head reminding them of their priorities and obligations.<br>(U//FOUO) So the hours are long and the pace is relentless-- why would anyone want to do<br>this? Immersion into this job provides one of the purest training experiences. An exec has a<br>front row seat to the good, the bad, and the ugly of the senior leadership lifestyle. Most execs<br>serve for a limited duration (12 to 24 months is typical)-- long enough to learn the job and be<br>effective, but short enough to maintain sanity. Whether they aspire to be a senior or just more<br>effective at their current level, executive assistants return to the workforce with a muchimproved understanding of the implications of their work as part of the big picture.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"></p>
