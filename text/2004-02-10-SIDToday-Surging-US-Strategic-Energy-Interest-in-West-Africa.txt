Oil output in the<br>region is forecast to double within 5 years. The United States will be relying on West Africa for at<br>least 25% of its imported oil by 2015, possibly by 2010. New discoveries of oil have been<br>pushing estimates of oil reserves in West African countries higher by billions of barrels every<br>year.<br>(S) Much of the new oil development in the region is in offshore deepwater facilities. Although<br>previously believed to be relatively safe from terrorist attack, recent takeovers of offshore oil<br>rigs by Nigerian militants have demonstrated the need for increased naval security in<br>deepwater. Security is necessary for thousands of U.S. oil workers, U.S.-owned drilling<br>platforms, floating storage facilities, and oil tankers. Stability in all West African countries is a<br>growing concern for the United States as it seeks to ensure a steady flow of oil from this region.<br>(U) West African oil is a preferred oil for the United States as it is a light, premium crude oil (low<br>sulfur, low chloride, and low paraffin content). U.S. and European refiners prefer light West<br>African crude because gasoline is easily distilled from it and it causes little air pollution when<br>refined. By comparison, Venezuelan and other Latin American oil export crude oils are becoming<br>heavier, necessitating upgrades to refineries to be able to process them. In addition, West<br>African oil tankers can reach the east coast of the United States in about 20 days (40 days is<br>required for oil from Saudi Arabia) and need not pass through any choke points, such as straits<br>or canals.<br>(U) A growing demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Europe and the United States will lead<br>to an even greater role for West Africa in energy markets. US and European energy companies<br>are building LNG plants (to liquefy the gas) in Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Sao Tome, and<br>Angola. U.S. companies are gearing up for increased deliveries of LNG. Although the U.S.<br>currently has only 4 LNG re-gasification plants (to turn the liquid back into gaseous form),<br>industry experts expect about 15 new plants to be constructed in the U.S. in the near future.<br>(S//SI) We can expect that the future U.S. energy strategy for West Africa will include the use of<br>diplomatic and trade leverage, as well as military strength to ensure that the flow of oil to the<br>United States and its allies is unimpeded. Over the next year, the SIGINT Enterprise should<br>anticipate customer requirements that will make stability and security in the Gulf of Guinea a<br>much higher priority. Africa may not always be important on the international political scene, but<br>it is important on the economic scene - and will play a more significant role in the future,<br>supplying more and cleaner energy sources.<br>(U) A more detailed SINIO Council Perspective on this issue is available.
