Mission Statement

S31176 provides cryptanalytic support services for many
network encryption protocols, including, but not limited to:
IPSec, SSL, PPTP, SSH and proprietary protocols. We are
the front-door of CES for targeted vulnerability assessment
and custom interim end-to-end exploitation flows for these
protocols. In conjunction with various agency SIGDEV
counterparts and target organizations, we engage in
discovery to find TOPI targets of interest. By maintaining
contact with field sites, TAO, and NCSC, we endeavor to
guide and direct development and access through both
active and passive means in order to make exploitation
possible and enable full prosecution of the target...

Purpose in a Nutshell

i Act as your one stop shop for all VPN and
network encryption exploitation related
issues!

i Act as a liaison for SIGDEVers and TOPIs
to other areas of the VPN community

i Perform some SIGDEV and target
discovery
