Levels

sera

Levels are 1.0 - 9.9 with lower numbers meaning higher priority.

This allows multiple signatures to match a piece of traffic, but
only the most specific appid will be applied. For example:

appidCchat', 9.9) = ...
appIdCchat/yahoo', 9.8) = ...
appidCchat/yahoo/incomlng', 9.7 = ...

If a session matches all three signatures, the appid will be
'chat/yahoo/incoming' since that has the best priority.
