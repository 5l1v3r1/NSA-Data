WHY ARE WE TEACHING THIS?

•	5 Pillars of IO:

-	OPSEC

-	MILDEC

-	MiSO

-	EW

-	CNO

•	The next major conflict will start in cyberspace

-	Whether we recognize the signs is another matter

-	Recent conflicts have already shown the importance of CNO (Russia/Georgia)

-	Think China will make a move on Taiwan without bringing down their communications
networks?

•	As IW officers (or IDC) - we are expected to know and understand
CNO and communicate with decision makers

•	Recently announced plans from Command in Chief and Pentagon
officials emphasize cyber space operations

•	Basic 1810/IDC quals are a good foundation, but CO/XO want you to
know more about CNO

Concept:

•	TAO recently completed a major effort to align resources from
R&T, ROC, DNT and MIT into mission focused teams.

•	Mission Aligned Cells

- Teams composed of operators, analysts and developers working together to focus on
a specific target set.

•	Allows TAO to efficiently resources on high-priority projects and
targets.

Networking Fundamentals

• Describe the following network component/terms:

-	Intranet

•	A private network not normally accessible through the internet.

-	Firewall

•	A mechanism to filter network traffic using rules based on attributes like source,
destination, packet type, port, and session status.

-	IDS (Intrusion Detection System):

•	Network traffic analyzer that uses patterns to detect malicious activity.

-	TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System).

•	Provides authentication, authorization, and accounting control to network devices via
central server.

-	RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service)

•	Authentication protocol for remote users to access network resources via network
access methods like Dial-in, VPN, DSL, and WAP.

Networking Fundamentals

• Define the following cross domain solutions:

-	High Assurance Guards

•	Connects networks operating within different security domains. Filters traffic like a
firewall but operates on all levels of the TCP/IP stack.

-	SABI (Secret and Below Interoperability)

•	Connection of Secret Security Domain to Security Domains of lesser classification
levels.

-	TSABI (Top Secret and Below Interoperability)

•	Connection of Top Secret Security Domain to domains of lesser classification levels.

-	Bastion Host

•	A host on an internal network that is also publicly exposed to the Internet or another
public network. Usually used for service hosting (web, email, etc) or as part of a
firewall solution.

TCP/IP Model

• List and describe the 4 layers of the TCP/IP Model to include how they
relate to the OSI Model:

- The TCP/IP model combines
the Session and Presentation
layers with the Application
layer. It is assumed if a
program has need of layer 5 or
6 functionality, then the
program will have to provide it.

Transport Layer TCP and UDP		Transport Layer

TCP 3-Way Handshake

• Define and illustrate the TCP 3-Way Handshake

- The 3-Way handshake is the method
that all TCP sessions use to initialize
connections and session parameters. It
follows the sequence SYN, SYN-ACK,
ACK. Application data can begin sending
with the final ACK packet.

TCP Flags

• Define and briefly describe the use of the following TCP flags:

-	SYN: Used to initialize the TCP by setting the packet sequence number

-	ACK: Used to acknowledge receipt of all package sequences up the number indicated

-	PSH: Indicates that that all data already received should be given to the application as soon
as possible. Flushes the buffer.

-	URG: Urgent Data. Commonly used for interrupts.

-	FIN: Indicates there is no more data to send from that end of the connection. Session
closes after both ends acknowledge FINs

-	RST: Immediate termination of connection. Commonly used to indicate unavailable

service.

• Discuss the following as it pertains to ARP:

- ADDRESS RESOLUTION:

• ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) facilitates the mapping between hardware
addresses (MAC Address) and logical network addresses (IP Addresses). This
mapping can be stored in a file or can determined through ARP broadcast requests on
a local network.

ICMP

• Discuss the following as it pertains to ICMP:

- ICMP is a protocol that defines a collection of message types commonly used for network
diagnostics.

•	Layer of the OSI model: ICMP (usually) consists of Layer 3 (Network) messages
transported by IP.

•	Ping: Message Type 8 (request) and 0 (reply). Used to determine if a device is active
on the network.

•	Traceroute: Uses a combination of the IP time-to-live (TTL) field and the ICMP
messages 11 (time exceeded) and 3.3 (port unreachable) to determine the route a
packet takes through the network.
