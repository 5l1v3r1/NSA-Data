WHY ARE WE TEACHING 

 

 

- 5 Pillars of IO:
OPSEC
MILDEC
MISO
EW
CNO
- The next major conflict will start in cyberspace
Whether we recognize the signs is another matter
Recent conflicts have already shown the importance of CNO (Russia/Georgia)

Think China will make a move on Taiwan without bringing down their communications
networks?

- As IW officers (or - we are expected to know and understand
CNO and communicate with decision makers

- Recently announced plans from Command in Chief and Pentagon
officials emphasize cyber space operations

- Basic quals are a good foundation, but want you to
know more about CNO

Concept:

- TAO recently completed a major effort to align resources from
T, ROC, DNT and MIT into mission focused teams.

- Mission Aligned Cells

Teams composed of operators, and developers working together to focus on
a specific target set.

- Allows TAO to efficiently resources on high-priority projects and
targets.

Current MA C?s:

- China/North Korea (NSA W, NSAH)

- Iran (NSA W, NSAG)

- Russia (NSAW, NSAH)

- Cyber Counterintelligence (NSA W, NSAG, NSA T, NSAH)
- Counterterrorism (CT) (NSA W, NSA G)

- Target Service Provider (TSP) (NSAW, NSA T)

- Regional Targets (RT) (NSA W, NSA T)
