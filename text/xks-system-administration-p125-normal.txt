■	The heart of the XKEYSCORE processing
engine is the xscore_proc with related plugins.

■	Input to the xscoreproc is either file-based
and from an file_input_proc, or streaming from
an sotf_input_proc.

■	After processing, the written metadata to the
insert databases can be sent to a follow on
system for additional processing.
