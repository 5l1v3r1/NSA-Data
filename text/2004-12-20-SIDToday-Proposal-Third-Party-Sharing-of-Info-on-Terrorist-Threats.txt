The plan proposes -- completely separate from our existing<br>bilateral relationships with the participants -- an immediate collaboration on the exchange of<br>threat warning information, and offers a communications mechanism whereby NSA will act as a<br>conduit for passing terrorist threat warning information among participating nations, much like<br>we did for the 2004 Summer Olympics.<br>(S//SI) This month's meeting included delegations from Singapore, Thailand, and South Korea.<br>Discussions went well, and the attendees asked many questions. Each of the delegations<br>understood the proposal and they are taking it back to their governments for consideration. We<br>should hear back from them all by early January, after which time we will begin to plan on a<br>Directorate-leve  conference in April, which will include DIRNSA and the principals from each<br>participating nation.<br>(S//SI) When I reported to the Director at the end of the conference, I told him I thought the<br>conference was "eminently successful," and that "the Third Parties were engaged and receptive."<br>I am confident that we are on our way to a successful multilateral collaboration in the Pacific.<br>(U) While I have your attention, I'd like to take a moment to say that, as we reach the end of<br>another year, I find myself marveling at everything we have initiated, experienced, and<br>accomplished. We continue to find new, imaginative, and fruitful ways of reaching out to our<br>partners, enabling them so they can better contribute to our mission. Across the globe and here<br>at home, NSA and FAD have dedicated partners in the truest sense of the word. Some are<br>foreigners and some are Americans, but they are all associates and colleagues, and without them<br>we would not have been able to even contemplate some of the progress we made this past year.<br>To all of our partners, here and abroad, I want to offer a heartfelt thank you, and warm wishes<br>for a wonderful and safe 2005.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
