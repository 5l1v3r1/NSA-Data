following information, and include the course name (AREA 1500 -- "Pakistan's Nuclear Force
Doctrine and Capabilities"), your name, SSN and organization.
Course Overview:
(S) The combination of growing nuclear weapons capabilities and misperceptions or hostile
intentions between Pakistan and India makes even minor incidents in Central Asia into potential
nuclear conflagrations. A better understanding of the knowns and unknowns about Pakinstan's
nuclear doctrine and capabilities is a starting point to solving the knowledge gaps on this
important intelligence target. What are Pakistan's nuclear "red lines"? Who can order nuclear
weapon's use? How are nuclear weapons secured and controlled? What nuclear delivery
capabilities do Pakistani forces possess? We will look into these and other questions to help
focus future intelligence efforts.
