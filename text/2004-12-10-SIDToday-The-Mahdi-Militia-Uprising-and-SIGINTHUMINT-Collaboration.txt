The<br>events in An Najaf, involving the Mahdi Militia and the leader Muqtada al-Sadr, were in full<br>swing, and the CSG's job was to advise Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I) on the latest<br>intelligence. The CSG fed timely all-source analysis to the MNF-I Director of Intelligence (C2),<br>Brigadier General DeFreitas, during the whole period -- from the outset of the uprising, during<br>Ayatollah Sistani's return to An Najaf, and through to the end of the Imam Ali Mosque Siege.<br>Ultimately, this information was used by MNF-I to guide operations by troops on the ground. For<br>the CSG, being collocated with some of these units at Camp Victory and seeing them return from<br>battle really drove home the importance of what we do as an intelligence community.<br>(TS//SI) A few weeks prior to the August uprising in An Najaf, CSG Baghdad had done an area<br>survey in support of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) to look for any activity by Lebanese Hizbollah<br>(LH). Though we could not find sustainable evidence of LH activity in the city, we did find an<br>inordinate number of Iranians. On August 21st , when the C2 called a meeting to discuss the<br>newly erupted crisis in An Najaf, CSG presented the work previously furnished to ISG.<br>(TS//SI) Once a concerted effort was begun on An Najaf, CSG Baghdad noted that the<br>aforementioned Iranian operatives were collocated with Mahdi Militia members, and a clear<br>picture unfolded of whom coalition forces were facing. Bear in mind, while the C2 needed full<br>support in An Najaf, the CSG was concurrently answering Requests for Information from units<br>throughout the whole of Iraq.<br>(TS//SI) With the analytic assault underway at CSG Baghdad, the C2 still needed the "whole"<br>picture, not just SIGINT. Already, the CSG was relying heavily on the great SIGINT work of<br>NSA's MENA , GEOCELL , and Counterterrorism (CT) Product Lines, CSGs in Tampa &amp; Qatar, not<br>to forget the tireless support of all the dedicated people at GRSOC. However, without HUMINT,<br>IMINT*, etc. the C2 would have been stuck with dots on a map and reports which to him would<br>have smacked of SIGINTese (although BG DeFreitas is a former "98G" voice<br>interceptor/linguist).<br>(TS//SI) Working with analysts from other agencies within the Intelligence Community in<br>Baghdad, CSG Baghdad was able to put names, faces and entire biographies to the dots on the<br>map. We were able to corroborate previous HUMINT reporting with historical research provided<br>by our GEOCELL's capabilities, thus adding validity to asset reporting.<br>(S) Some potentially life-saving analysis came from the Coalition Explosive Exploitation Cell<br>(CEXC), staffed by Explosive Ordnance Demolition experts from many agencies, services and<br>countries. They piece together the "improvised explosive devices and their variants" (IED) story<br>in Iraq. Using their work, we could determine where explosives were hidden, how they were<br>being smuggled into An Najaf, what was their origin and who was using them.<br>(TS//SI) It is not the role of the CSG to present the C2 with targeting storyboards, though that<br>is in effect what it was producing. Thankfully, CSG Baghdad is collocated with the Targeting Cell.<br>This group of multi-service officer and enlisted intelligence analysts was able to fuse the<br>incredible amount of data relating to An Najaf and create succinct storyboards, which<br>appropriate units could turn into successful 'capture/kill' missions.<br>(S) SIGINT doesn't happen in a vacuum, nor does a C2 in a war zone have time to sift through<br><br> </p>all their "-INTs" while a crisis unfolds. The clearest battlefield picture must be presented<br>consistently and repeatedly to the C2. The fact that the Imam Ali Shrine is still intact, the Mahdi<br>Militia is in disarray and relative calm has returned to An Najaf is testimony to the successful<br>collaboration of the "-INTs" in time of crisis.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>CSG = Cryptologic Services Group <br>HUMINT = Human Intelligence <br>IMINT = Imagery Intelligence <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
