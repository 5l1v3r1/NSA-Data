While fugitive apprehension remains one of its core missions, USMS<br>responsibilities and operations now include support to National Special Security Events (NSSEs)*<br>and protection of the U.S. jurisprudence system. Like special forces of the justice system, they<br>provide force protection to U.S. law enforcement agencies themselves. The scope of their foreign<br>mission is quickly expanding in support of the Global War on Terrorism and homeland security,<br>and NSA is teaming with them in a relationship that promises mutual benefits.<br>Who Are the Marshals?<br>(C) USMS, like DEA and FBI, is a component of the Department of Justice and is operationally<br>dispersed across the country and around the globe. To counter the growing worldwide<br>dimension of the threats, USMS is working hard to establish more offices abroad and collaborate<br>more closely with foreign law enforcement, including Interpol and European Union authorities.<br>(C) The Marshals' unique expertise lies in pinpointing the location of fugitives. After<br>apprehension, they typically render the bad guys quickly to other law enforcement authorities.<br>We rarely see U.S. Marshals on the podium announcing a major arrest-they are one organization<br>that prefers not to take the credit in public. (But just ask them off-stage, and they will give you<br>the real scoop.) Their Electronic Surveillance Unit (ESU) functions like an intelligence operations<br>team to stealthily monitor the communications and movements of fugitives of U.S. justice. This<br>team had provided technical assistance in the efforts to capture the elusive DC area sniper in<br>the Fall of 2002.<br>(C) During major events, including trials of notorious fugitives, the Marshals provide force<br>protection and coordinate closely with other law enforcement agencies. In this respect, the ESU<br>has been preparing for upcoming terrorist trials in Northern Virginia by surveilling and<br>photographing the court area from the air, conducting ground inspections, and analyzing lead<br>information to determine potential threat sources, safe routes, and defensive positions.<br>How Does SID Interact with the Marshals?<br>(C//SI) SID's relationship with USMS was formalized in a February 2004 Memorandum of<br>Understanding. The potential benefit of SIGINT support for the apprehension of foreign fugitives<br>is obvious, particularly as USMS expands its presence and activities abroad. However, both NSA<br>and USMS can also gain much by exchanging expertise in areas such as geolocational and social<br>network analysis, contact chaining, and technical/collection tools. The fact that Marshals stay out<br>of the public limelight and courtrooms helps reduce fears of jeopardizing SIGINT equities -- the<br>new MOU establishes further procedures for handling SIGINT and acting on lead information that<br>is based on foreign intelligence and counterintelligence.<br>(C//SI) The ESU recently completed a new SCIF with assistance from NSA's Information<br>Assurance Directorate (IAD) and soon will be plugged into the Intelligence Community over the<br>Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). As their mission grows, the<br>Marshals are also realizing the potential benefits of further IAD products and services to secure<br>their communications and operations.<br>(C//SI) For its part, SID touches this law enforcement partner through its representative to the<br>Department of Justice and further manages the relationship with a Customer Account Manager<br>and Senior Executive Account Manager. This S1 team facilitates USMS exchanges with S2 and S3<br>elements, and the Office of General Counsel is an integral member of this partnership. As with<br>all law enforcement entities, new formal SIGINT requirements are submitted through the FBI.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">SID's relationship with USMS is just getting off the ground, and NSA is sure to enjoy many<br>success stories as our partnership grows.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information: Contact the SID Account Management office (S112) or visit<br>the Marshals' Internet website: http://www.usmarshals.gov<br>*(U) Note: See the related story NSA Provides Un-'conventional' Support .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
