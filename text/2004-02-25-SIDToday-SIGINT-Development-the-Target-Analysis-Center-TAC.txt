What is the TAC, you say? It<br>is one of three centers included in the larger SIGINT Development<br>(SIGDEV) Strategy and Governance organization established in the<br>summer of 2002. The TAC strives to address the issues of knowing<br>the global networks such that the NSA can fulfill its goal to know<br>the target, its technologies, and its social networks to enable<br>meaningful intelligence production.<br>(U//FOUO) The TAC's mission is to develop corporate-level analytic<br>tools and techniques to assist the processes to collect, exploit, and<br>analyze target systems on the global network such that the SIGINT<br>system will know and own the target space especially when events<br>require it.<br>(U//FOUO) To accomplish our task, we work with other SIGDEV<br>centers to synthesize and access network, target, and technology<br>knowledge information to develop a complete and coherent target<br>picture. We also develop tools and techniques for target activity<br>analysis using the datasets we enable, such as Global Intelligent<br>Network mobility services, including processes for event analysis<br>throughout the SIGINT community.<br>(U) To learn more about what we do, see the TAC missions and<br>functions .<br>(U//FOUO) If you think we may be able to assist you in getting to<br>know the various technologies of your targets, understanding the<br>various tools available to the analyst, or even trying to discover<br>what data might exists that you were unaware of, just give us a<br>call or send us an email.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SIGINT Development <br>1.

The NAC's<br>Data/Network<br>Operations Center<br>(DNOC)<br><br>(U//FOUO) Today the TAC has three separate subelements: the<br>Metadata Analysis Cell (MAC), the Social Network Analysis<br>Workcenter (SNAW), and Target Development Services (TDS).
