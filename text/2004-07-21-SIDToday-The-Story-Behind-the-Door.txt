Many people wondered about the motivation<br>behind "the door". Well, this is the story...<br>(U//FOUO) It all started back in late 2002 when the programmers and management of all the<br>different projects that make up the new voice processing system got the opportunity to sit<br>together and all moved to 1C131/1C145. We finally had space of our own, and we were happy to<br>be there. To show our pride for our work and support for our country, we started a tradition of<br>decorating the door with patriotic posters and flags.<br>(U) 1C is a very busy hallway, and our decorations quickly developed a fan club. It was even<br>more interesting how quickly the decorated door became a landmark - particularly for the<br>occupants of the room. Use of the decoration for determining where "home" is has become so<br>strong, that now a warning goes out to all occupants of the room the day before decorations are<br>changed!<br>(U) Well -- that might help explain why we decorate at all, but we will admit that the July 4th<br>door is pretty special. Let's talk about door decorating contests.... We started small and simple<br>with the 2002 Holiday decoration contest. Two more contests came and went (July 4 and Holiday<br>2003), and we won honorable mention for the Holiday 2003 effort. During this time we looked at<br>winning doors and gathered ideas. We really wanted a door that was worthy of our high traffic<br>location and the pride we feel in our work. We wanted a door that people would enjoy stopping<br>to look at, and one that would make them think about our proud heritage.<br>(U) The 2004 July 4 door decorating contest became the focus of all of these goals. We gathered<br>a team of 5 excited and creative individuals, with a range of talents to bring to the table. Our<br>engineers made detailed measurements and drew plans for the construction, our electrical<br>experts figured out how to run the lighting, our craft people scoured stores looking for materials<br>that would work, and we all searched our homes for the bits and pieces that would come<br>together for the multiple dioramas we had decided to produce. We strove to depict intelligence<br>activities throughout American history, and at the same time tie in the work we are actually<br>doing - so one of the boxes shows screen shots of our software.<br>(U//FOUO) As with any truly successful project, the door was a team effort. A team of 5<br>dedicated and interested people pulled the door together with the support, understanding, and<br>tolerance of the other 25 who reside behind the door.<br>(U) We are appreciative that the contest awarded us a blue ribbon, but are more humbled and<br>appreciative of the comments we get from people who stop and view the door. Our fans tell us<br>it's awesome! We see many people stop and smile when they pass by. We hope the door gives<br>them a good feeling way down deep. We have people open our door and shout in, "Awesome<br>door", or come in and just want to talk to us for a few minutes about it. Every one of us has<br>been stopped on the way in or out of the room by someone who wants to know more about the<br>door - and we are all happy to take a few minutes to chat about the heritage it depicts. For us,<br>it's not the contest, but the opportunity to provide a reminder of the proud heritage we all share.<br>(U) So now our door now has a life of its own, and a reputation to maintain.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
