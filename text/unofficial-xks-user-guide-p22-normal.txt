Follow-on Actions tell XKEYSCORE to do things after it runs your query. For example,
it can email you with the results, or it can send them to Agility, or any combination of the
two. For this example, I want XKEYSCORE to email me telling me I have results and I
want it to download my results to Agility. Make sure you select Send to Agility if you
want the same.
