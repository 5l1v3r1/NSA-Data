Vulnerability Assessment Process Development

Enabling CNO For intelligence production teams, based on Target Templating methodology

Target Templating ts a hypothesis-based,
collaborative methodology for doing network
analysis. By constructing a logical hypothesis from
your knowledge gaps, a target thread is produced.
The thread is based on the understanding of 6
‘Layers* understanding the target domain and how it
connects to the global network, and then
understand*^ what opportunities can bo oxploited to

gain access. )_ayer 7 captures the work flow, and what needs
to be done to achieve the outcome. Target Templating
provides that framework in order to break down a problem
into the essential pans necessary to develop access and
network knowledge Visualisation of this knowledge at all
Layers is essential to spotting linkages both honzontally
across the layers and verticaty through them, so the use of a
visualisation package during the NADP will be encouraged.

Information Need.
Knowledge Gap
Hypothesis

Layer 1: Target - An Entity such as a
person or organisation.

Layer 2: Infrastructure - How the target
connects to the global network

Layer 3: Technology - Understanding the
technology the target uses to communicate

Layer 4: Vulnerabilities - Looking for
vulnerabilities in the technologies

Layer S: Capabilities - Can we exploit the
vulnerabilities?

Layer 6: Access - What assets do we have
to collect the traffic?

Layer 7: Expectation. Planning, Delivery -

How are we going to achieve the

desired outcome?
