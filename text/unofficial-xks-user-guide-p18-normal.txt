Creating a WorkFlow

Workflows are periodic queries you can set up that run at specified times. They are great
for sustained targets because they query the database for you (c.g. every night) and you
can easily view the recently collected traffic without having to create a new query each
day. They are also very helpful if you are performing target discover)' on a network and
haven't seen much traffic yet on a selector. A workflow for an email address can bridge
the gap between when you discover the selector (and you task it to UTT/Cadence) and
when it actually makes it to the appropriate dictionaries).

It’s important to understand that a normal (ad hoc) query is submitted when you hit
Submit. Workflows, on the other hand, are created then submitted to the XKEYSCORE
team for review. The XKEYSCORE team docs not review it for USSID-18 compliance

(that’s up to you); they only review it to ensure your query won’t strain the system with too complex a query.  The first step in creating a Workflow is click on Workflow Central:

Then click on Request on the left to start the Workflow Request Wizard, and then click
Next.
