Currently this<br>is a disease almost entirely contained in the bird population, but<br>the World Health Organization is very concerned that in time the<br>virus may develop the ability to pass easily from human to human.<br>Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in<br>birds have been confirmed in Europe and there is concern it may<br>spread to bird populations in other regions of the world.<br>(S//SI) Migratory birds, especially waterfowl, have been a primary<br>agent in this geographic leap, causing new animal and human<br>populations to be at risk of exposure to the disease. Experts are<br>concerned that as birds migrate southward, regions such as east<br>Africa with poor health infrastructures, will be overwhelmed and<br>unable to contain the deadly virus in their bird populations.<br>(According to press, because the migratory birds have already<br>flown over the U.S. towards their winter homes, it is unlikely that<br>we will face the threat of the virus being carried into the country<br>by feathered visitors this year.)<br>(U/FOUO) Avian flu exists almost everywhere. There are 15<br>subtypes of influenza virus known to infect birds, but the highly<br>pathogenic forms tend to be caused by influenza A viruses of<br>subtypes H5 and H7. "Highly pathogenic" refers only to the virus'<br>ability to cause disease in birds, this term does not apply to human<br>infection. The H5N1 strain first emerged in Hong Kong in 1997,<br>causing the death or destruction of 1.5 million birds and sickening<br>18 people, killing six.<br>(U//FOUO) It re-emerged in 2003 in South Korea, and has now<br>spread across Asia, into Russia and Europe. It is the virus's<br>tendency to make mistakes when replicating itself that makes it so<br>dangerous and unpredictable. Human to human transmission has<br>not yet been confirmed. Although experts believe that mutation will<br>occur, it is unknown at this time how virulent the resulting strain<br>will be.<br>(S//SI) NSA analysts are also monitoring worldwide reactions to<br>the spread of the virus and preparations for a possible pandemic.<br>Analysts are also closely engaged with the other members of the<br>IC as well as our Second and Third Party Partners to stay abreast of<br>developments. As our IC colleagues have said, containing the<br>threat of infectious disease comes down to "detection, detection,<br>detection.
