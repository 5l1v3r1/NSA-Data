Communication vs DNI Content

¥

Selection engines in use today were based on
designs built to handle TELEX traffic
TELEX is a highly formatted content rich type of
traffic that does not resemble raw DNI seen with
Internet traffic

Raw Internet traffic contains HTML, web-pages,
raw base-64 encoded documents etc.

When analysts think of DNI “content” they are
more referring to “communication content” then
raw DNI content.
