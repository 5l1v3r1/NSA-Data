Well, you can relax, because there are<br>solutions available. As briefed by the Legacy Data Migration - Voice<br>Task Team, Document Management System (DMS) and HOMEBASE<br>eWorkSpace (eWS) are viable alternatives. DMS is preferred for<br>handling file-based, non-fielded data and eWS for fielded data.<br>(U//FOUO) DMS is a document management and analytic<br>knowledge sharing system. It provides users with DMS "My Files"<br>repositories, which can be customized and personalized. In<br>addition, DMS gives users access to large numbers of need-toknow documents for read and search purposes. Currently, there<br>are approximately 50 organizational repositories available in DMS.<br>(U//FOUO) What do you need to do to get your working aids<br>moved to DMS? Actually, moving the documents is the easy part.<br>Organizing the documents is what requires the time and effort. So,<br>that is what you need to start doing: each office should review the<br>working aids they have and eliminate any that are unnecessary or<br>no longer used. All documents that remain need to be categorized.<br>Contact <br> <br>, for more complete guidance<br>and to begin the process of migrating your information to this new<br>system.<br>(U//FOUO) What about that fielded data? eWS to the rescue! An<br>eWS is a collaboration tool that help analysts share, collect,<br>analyze and report on targets of interest through a single data<br>broker.<br>(U//FOUO) HomeBase eWorkSpaces are web-accessible databases<br>that help you handshake with analysts around the world who<br>pursue the same targets of interest. You can post a network<br>diagram based off someone else's FactSheet and fill in more<br>information into the related eWorkSpace based on your research.<br>You can post hypotheses and get different perspectives. You may<br>choose to discuss your conclusions with your Second Party<br>partners. Talk about it online with instant messaging.<br>(U//FOUO) Then take another look at all your target records<br>grouped by nationality, location, organization, and profession -any way you choose to organize them. "Drill down" to any record<br>when some detail catches your attention. Export information of<br>interest to a file and include that information into other reports or<br>in another totally different application like network analysis tools or<br>mapping systems.<br>(U//FOUO) <br> <br>, can provide details about eWS if<br>you have questions.
