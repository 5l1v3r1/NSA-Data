Op IRRITANT HORN
Does the tradecraft work?

Another Arab Spring (only this time, different countries)

Goal: identify aggregation points for the mobile networks in
the countries of interest using the tradecraft developed during
the workshops

Did it work? YES -> the team was able to identify connections
from the countries to application and vendor servers in non 5-
Eyes countries

So what? We found some servers....

What does the tradecraft achieve?

•	This tradecraft will provide a list of servers that have been seen communicating with a mobile network

In what situations would this tradecraft be most useful?

•	To identifymobile application servers for a specific network

•	To identifyanyserverthat maybe useful forcollection purposes

Describe any problems,caveats or things to watch out for

•	The list ofservers returned depends on the the IP range and collection sources utilized Success of this tradecraft may require additional
research to identify other IP ranges or requesting other agencies to check their collection to identify different servers

5 EYES Tradecraft Steps (document underlying analytic, do not include tools)

The IP ranges utilized for the initial implementation of tins tradecraft were the Inter PLMN Backbone IP ranges obtained from IR21 documents For
other methods of identifying mobile IP blocks, see the invoked tradecraft listed above

Step 1) Take IP ranges or individual addresses identified as being related to mobile network communications

Step 2) Obtain geolocation information and network ownership information for each IP address This should indude Network Owner name
Carrier name, ASN. Continent, Country. Region. City. LatLong. and anyother related details that your system can obtain
Step 3) Obtain Internet communication events related to the IP addresses These events should minim ally include source information, To
IP. From IP, TCP Direction, and HTTP User-Agent

Step4) Sort the results and dedup them This step depends on your collection sources

Step 5) Filter out server communications thathave user-agents that aren't useful Further analysis is needed to identify the non-useful
user-agents (cheatsheet needed) Ex friendly-scanner
Step 6) Check the TCP Direction field

•	IfSeiverto Client, grab the From IP information

•	If Client to Server, grab the To IP information

•	IfSeiverto Seiver, grab both the To and From IP information

•	»Unknown, capture in an error log

Step 7) Sort and dedup again based on Seiver IP information TCP Direction info is no longer needed

Step 8) Obtain geolocabon information and network ownership information for each Server IP This is done for the servers thatwere notin
the original IP Blocks

Step 9) Remove any servers that are not useful This may include 5-Eyes servers
Step 10) Output

•	List ofServers

•	List of related User Agents

•	List of related hostnames

Outcomes

Refinement of XKS fingerprints to identify mobile bearers, Samsung and
Android Marketplace servers

Documentation of analytics in CRAFTY SHACK

0 These analytics are now being implemented across the 5 Eyes

Proving the tradecraft actually works!

Op IRRITANT HORN
Does the tradecraft work?

Another Arab Spring (only this time, different countries)

Goal: identify aggregation points for the mobile networks in
the countries of interest using the tradecraft developed during
the workshops

Did it work? YES -> the team was able to identify connections
from the countries to application and vendor servers in non 5-
Eyes countries

So what? We found some servers....

MiTM - exploit the application server and use it as a MiTM platform for
handset exploitation

Effects - exploitation of the application servers could make it possible to
provide selective misinformation to the targets handsets

Harvesting data at rest - exploitation of the applications servers could provide
access to a wealth of information at rest. The amount and usefulness of this
information depends on the application in question

Harvesting data in transit - mobile applications servers often send and receive
data that SIGINT agencies find useful (e.g. the Samsung protocol sending
client and handset details to a server in Germany)

Finding mobile application &

► II a t; * H v «*	8. i«s

TOP SECRET//SI

The results above are from a tradecraft to find servers of applications and
vendor updaters servers from given countries, The rationale behind this is to
identify servers that target within those countries might visit which could be
exploited by CNE to push a phone implant capability.

The tradecraft relies upon 5 tuple data seen from the mobile gateways from
target countries and to servers which have matching ‘key words’ in the
hostname. The results above could then be scoped for CNE to see if they
would be valid boxes to use an access platform.
