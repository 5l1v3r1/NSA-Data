What is Tor?

•	Tor is an implementation of 2ntl generation onion routing

•	Originally sponsored by the US Naval Research Laboratory

•	Later became an Electronic Frontier Foundation project

•	Helps to prevent network traffic analysis & surveillance

•	Open network with over 2000 nodes

•	Anonymity tool

•	Uses multiple layers of encryption

• Multi-hop proxy

What is it used for?

• The Good

-	People living in oppressive countries (circumvent firewalls)

-	Access to free media instead of state propaganda

-	People can say what they want without it being linked to their public profile

• The Bad

-	Bot herders use Tor to give instructions to their bots

-	Allows paedophiles access content without linking themselves to it

-	State actors can launch attacks without being attributable

-	“Anonymous” & LULZSec

What do we see?

•	Any traffic between the client & tor is heavily encrypted.

•	We can only really see traffic from an exit node to a website

-	But we don’t know where this traffic originated from

•	Still could link up aliases though

-	‘Somebody’ could still visit a dodgy forum and log in with an alias, or even
send an email using a known target email address (Assuming they don't
use SSL).

•	Phew... at least there is some intelligence gain.... Right?

• Not much...

• All Hidden Service traffic is heavily encrypted.

• Most we can gather is that one Tor node talks to another (IP level)

• Hiding in the crowd at its best!

The dot com onion BOOM

•	What’s this .onion business?

-	TLD Tor uses to initiate a connection to a hidden service

•	Example onion domain

-	16 characters in base32 (few characters are actually missing)

-	oqznfi3tdo6nwg3f.onion

•	DNS?

-	Tor uses something similar to DNS to resolve an onion domain

-	Onion domains ‘resolve’ to 3+ IP addresses called Introduction Points (IPT)

Possible Exploits?

•	Rendezvous Point (RP)

-	What if we owned the RP?

-	Traffic still encrypted, although only a single layer of encryption

-	Still only content, don’t know who the user is or where the HS is located

-	Clients randomly select their RP so unlikely to be picked anyway

•	Hidden Service Directory (HSDir)

-	If we take a HSDir down, there are still many left

-	Could potentially collect onion domains if we acted as a HSDir

•	Client

-	No real way to distinguish between a Tor user accessing the web or a HS

• Introduction Points (IPT)

-	All Hidden Service IPTs are listed on its descriptor (the thing that’s stored
on a HSDir)

-	Potential for an attack on IPTs to stop them accepting connections for the
HS

-	This could be done using a ‘Coil Attack’

- HS can encrypt their IPTs in their descriptor (but not many do)

- What about exploiting the HS directly?

- Potential to identify the IP addresses hidden services

• But cant really say which one

-	Identified a beaconing pattern from HS

-	Dependant on collection posture

-	Great for PRESTON

Summary

•	Tor helps people become anonymous

•	Very naughty people use Tor

•	Hidden Services hide the fact web content even exits!

•	Near impossible to figure out who is talking to who

•	Its complicated

•	Some areas for further research

•	Until then... Doesn't stop us from using them
