Although I often sought advice from my<br>professors in graduate school, it wasn't often -- or ever -- that I met with former directors of the<br>NSA. As one of my current professors at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of<br>Texas at Austin, Bobby Inman had an opinion on a matter that I truly valued: what it was like to<br>work at the NSA.<br>(U) I was looking for an internship to fill my time during the summer months and had great<br>offers from the NSA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the President's office, and<br>the General Accounting Office (GAO). My criteria for the experience were fairly simple. In the<br>wake of 9/11, my major reason for going to graduate school to study public policy in the fall<br>2002 was to position myself to serve my country. I also wanted to work in the Washington<br>metro area. And of course, being a struggling grad student meant an all-important necessity: a<br>paycheck. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately for the decision process), all three offers met<br>these standards.<br>(U) Thus I turned to the Admiral, and it was his opinion that sealed the deal. He laid it out in<br>simple terms for me: the NSA was his all-time favorite job . Having served a tour as an<br>intelligence analyst (IA) at NSA while rising in the ranks of the Navy, VADM Inman had a more<br>diverse background than most -- if not all -- university professors. He worked at a wide variety<br>of stops in the public sector -- including a tour as the deputy director at the CIA -- and later<br>served in executive positions for private sector companies. In a word, VADM Inman's work<br>experience was expansive and I trusted his insight. I wanted a place that I would enjoy working,<br>and thus signed up for the 2004 intelligence analyst summer intern program (NETA 2007).<br>(U) The internship is unique in that about half of the program consists of classes and briefings,<br>and the other half is made up of a project that interns work on throughout the summer. Due to<br>the brief stint of internships, the "intern experience" at various companies and government<br>agencies throughout the world is often generalized in a negative light -- i.e. inefficiencies and<br>slow days for the intern result in filing or the twiddling of thumbs. Yet the NSA has done<br>something highly intelligent and commendable: invested a great deal of time and resources into<br>the sixteen IA summer interns. A cost-benefit analysis of this program would be interesting to<br>see, as almost every IA summer intern from years past has returned to work as a full-time IA,<br>going through the three-year intern training program. But recruiting and retention is not the<br>only benefit; the returnees are one-step (or many) ahead of other incoming IA interns because<br>of the many courses taken throughout the summer.<br>(U) After five short weeks in the program, I can wholeheartedly conclude that this experience<br>has been tremendously worthwhile. First, it has allowed an insightful glimpse at the NSA and the<br>entire intelligence community. I have learned about many important research tools and seen in<br>great depth how the NSA operates at the macro- and micro-levels. Second, I have observed<br>something that is quite unique in the working world. VADM Inman is not the only one that holds<br>the NSA as his "all-time favorite job." Here at NSA, I have found that most feel that way. And<br>for this intern, that's an awesome thing to see.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
