ORDER

The United States has submitted an application pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d),
requesting that the Court issue an Order requiring Lavabit LLC, an electronic communications
service provider and/or a remote computing service located in Dallas, TX, to disclose the records
and other information described in Attachment A to this Order.

that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other information sought are
relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.

The Court determines that there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of
this Order will seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation, including by giving targets an
opportunity to flee or continue flight from prosecution, destroy or tamper with evidence, change
patterns of behavior, or notify confederates. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(2), (3), (5).

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), that Lavabit LLC
shall, within ten days of the date of this Order, disclose to the United States the records and other
information described in Attachment A to this Order.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lavabit LLC shall not disclose the existence of the
application of the United States, or the existence of this Order of the Court, to the subscribers of
the account(s) listed in Attachment A, or to any other person, unless and until otherwise

The Court finds that the United States has offered specific and articulable facts showing

authorized to do so by the Court, except that Lavabit LLC may disclose this Order to an attorney
for Lavabit LLC for the purpose of receiving legal advice.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the application and this Order are sealed until
otherwise ordered by the Court.

MOTION FOR ENTRY OF AN ORDER TO COMPEL

The United States, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby requests the Court
enter an Order directing Lavabit, LLC-, to comply with the Court’s June 28, 2013 Pen
Register/Trap and Trace Order. In support of the motion the United States declares as follows:

1. On June 28,2013, at approximately 4 p.m., this Court entered an Order pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. § 3123 authorizing the installation and use of a pen register and the use of a trap and
trace device (“pen/trap device”) on all electronic communications being sent from or sent to the

electronic mail account

LLC.

I. That e-mail account is controlled by Lavabit,

2.	In its Order, the Court found that the information to be collected by the pen/trap
device would be relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. In addition, the Court ordered
Lavabit “shall furnish agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, forthwith, all
information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation and use
of the pen/trap device.”

3.	The Federal Bureau of Investigation served a copy of the Order on Lavabit that
same afternoon. A representative of Lavabit stated that it could not provide the requested
information because the user of the account had enabled Lavabit’s encry ption services, and thus

Lavabit would not provide the requested information. The representative of Lavabit indicated
that Lavabit had the technical capability to decrypt the information but that Lavabit did not want
to "defeat [its] own system.”

4.	The representative of Lavabit did not comply with the Order, and indicated he
first wanted to seek legal advice.

5.	The Pen Register and Trap and Trace Act gives this Court the authority to order a
provider to assist the government in the execution of a lawdul pen register or trap and trace order,
including by providing information. Section 3122 of Title 18, United States Code, provides in
part: “An order issued under this section— ... shall direct, upon the request of the applicant, the
furnishing of information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the
installation of the pen register or trap and trace device under section 3124 of this title." Section
3124(a) provides, “Upon the request of an attorney for the Government or an officer of a law
enforcement agency authorized to install and use a pen register under this chapter, a provider of
wire or electronic communication service... shall furnish such investigative or law enforcement
officer forthwith all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the
installation of the pen register unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference... if such

assistance is directed by a court order as provided in section 3123(b)(2) of this title." Section
3124(b) contains a similar provision governing trap and trace orders.

Wherefore, the United States requests an Order directing I.avabit to comply forthwith
with the Court's June 28, 2013 Order.

MOTION OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW' CAUSE

The United States, through tne undersigned counsel, pursuant to Title 18, United States
Code, Section 401, hereby moves fcr the issuance of an order directing Ladar Levison, the owner
and operator of Lavabit LLC, an electronic communications sendee provider, to show cause why
Lavabit LLC has failed to comply with the orders entered lune 28, 2013, in this matter and, as a
result, why this Court should not hold Mr. Levison and Lavabit LLC in contempt for its
disobedience and resistence to these lawful orders. The United States further requests that the
Court convene a hearing on this motion on July 16, 2013, at 10:00 a.m., and issue a summons
directing Mr. Levison to appear before this Court on that date. In support of this motion, the
United States represents:

an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) directing Lavabit LLC to provide, within ten days,
additional records and information about^|^^^|email account. Mr. Levison received that
order on June 11, 2013. Mr. Levison responded by mail, which was not received by the
government until June 27, 2013. Mr. Levison provided very little of the information sought by
the June 10, 2013 order.

On June 28, 2013, the United States obtained a pen register/trap and trace order on
mail account, a copy of which is attached together with the application for that

order.

4.	On June 28, 2013, FBI special agents met Mr. Levison at his residence in Dallas,
Texas, and discussed the prior grand jury' subpoena served on Lavabit LLC and the pen register
order entered that day. Mr. Levison did not have a copy of the order when he spoke with the
agents, but he received a copy from the FBI within a few minutes of their conversation. Mr.
Levison told the agents that he would not comply with the pen register order and wanted to speak
to an attorney. It was unclear whether Mr. Levison would not comply with the order because it
was technically not feasible or difficult or because it w'as not consistent with his business practice
of providing secure, encrypted emai l service for his customers.

-2-

5.

On June 28, 2013, after this conversation with Mr. Levison, the United States

obtained an Order Compelling Compliance Forthwith, which directed Lavabit to comply with the
pen register order. Copies of that motion and order are attached.

6.	Since June 28, 2013, the FBI has made numerous attempts, without success, to
speak and meet directly with Mr. Levison to discuss the pen register order and his failure to
provide “all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the
installation and use of the pen/trap device” as required by that order. As of this date, Lavabit
LLC has not complied with the order.

7.	The United States requests that the Court enter the attached proposed order
directing Mr. Levison to show cause why Lavabit LLC has failed to comply with the pen register
order and why, therefore, he should not be held in contempt. The United States requests that this
show cause hearing be scheduled for July 16, 2013, at 10:00 a.m., and that a summons be issued
directing Mr. Levison to appear before this Court on that date.

8.	The June 10, 2013 Section 2703(d) Order and the June 28, 2013 pen register order
remain under seal. In addition, these orders provide that Lavabit LLC shall not disclose the
existence of the govememnt’s applications and the orders to the subscriber^^^^^Jor to any
other persons unless otherwise authorized to do so by court order, except that Lavabit LLC may
disclose the orders to an attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice regarding these orders.
The United States requests that these documents remain under seal, that the non-disclosure

-3-

provisions of the orders remain in effect, and that this motion and order and any subsequent
pleadings and/or proceedings regarding this motion also be sealed.

ORDER

ALEXANDRIA. m::v

The United States has submitted an application pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b),
requesting that the Court issue an Order commanding Lavabit, an electronic communications
service provider and/or a remote computing service, not to notify any person (including the
subscribers or customers of the account(s) listed in the search warrant) of the existence of the
attached search warrant until further order of the Court.

The Court determines that there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of
the attached warrant will seriously jeopardize the investigation, including by giving targets an
opportunity to flee or continue flight from prosecution, destroy or tamper with evidence, change
patterns of behavior, or notify confederates. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(2), (3), (5).

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) that Lavabit shall not
disclose the existence of the attached search warrant, or this Order of the Court, to the listed
subscriber or to any other person, unless and until otherwise authorized to do so by the Court,
except that Lavabit may disclose the attached search warrant to an attorney for Lavabit for the
purpose of receiving legal advice.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the application and this Order are sealed until
otherwise ordered by the Court.

STATES OF AMERICA FOR AN ORDER
AUTHORIZING THE USE OF A PEN
REGISTER/TRAP AND TRACE DEVICE
ON AN ELECTRONIC MAIL ACCOUNT

) FILED UNDER SEAL

No. 1:13EC297

SUPPLEMENT TO THE MOTION OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The United States, through the undersigned counsel, submits the following additional
information in support of its show cause motion filed July 9, 2013:

1.	Following the issuance of the Court’s Order to Show Cause, the government had a
meeting/conference call with Mr. Levison and his then counsel. Mr. Levison was in Dallas,
Texas, at the FBI field office, at the time, and his counsel from San Francisco, California, and
prosecutors and FBI agents from the Washington, D.C. field office participated by telephone. The
conference call was convened to discuss Mr. Levison’s questions and concerns about the
installation and operation of a pen register on the targeted email account. Mr. Levison’s
concerns focused primarily on how the pen register device would be installed on the Lavabit LLC
system, what data would be captured by the device, what data would be viewed and preserved by
the government. The parties also discussed whether Mr. Levison would be able to provide
“keys” for encrypted information.

2.	During the conference call, the FBI explained to Mr. Levison that the pen register
could be installed with minimal impact to the Lavabit LLC system, and the agents told Mr.

Levison that they would meet with him when they were ready to install the device and go over
with him any of the technical details regarding the installation and use of the pen register. As for
the data collected by the device, the agents assured Mr. Levison that the only data that the agents
would review is that which is stated in the order and nothing more (i.e., user log-in information
and the date, time, and duration of the transmissions for the target account).

?. Lavabit LLC provides encryption service to paid users	Based

on the conference call with Mr. Levison, the FBI is reasonably confident that with the encryption
keys, which Mr. Levison can access, it would be able view in an un-encrypted format any
encrypted information required to be produced through the use of the pen register.

4.	Mr. Levison and his attorney did not commit to the installation and use of the pen
register at the conclusion of the July 10 conference call. On July 11, 2013, counsel who
participated in the conference call informed the government that she no longer represented Mr.
Levison or Lavabit LLC. In addition, Mr. Levison indicated that he would not come to court
unless the government paid for his travel.

5.	On July 11, 2013, FBI agents served Mr. Levison with a grand jury subpoena
directing him to appear before the grand jury in this district on July 16, 2013. As a grand jury
witness, the government was responsible for making Mr. Levison’s travel arrangements.

6.	On July 11,2013, the undersigned counsel sent Mr. Levison an email indicating
that he has been served with a show cause order from this Court requiring his appearance on July
16, 2013, and a subpoena requiring his appearance on the same date before a federal grand jury.
The email further advised Mr. Levison that he should contact the United States Attorney's Office
as soon as possible to make his travel arrangements.

- 2 -

7.	On July 13, 2013, Mr. Levison, who was no longer represented by counsel, sent
government prosecutors an email indicating that he would be able to collect the data required by
the pen register and provide that data to the government after 60 days (the period of the pen
register order). For this service. Mr. Levison indicated that the government would have to pay
him $2000 for “developmental time and equipment” plus an additional $1500 if the government
wanted the data “more frequently” than after 60 days.

8.	On July 13, 2013, the government responded to Mr. Levison’s proposal. The
prosecutors informed Mr. Levison that the pen register is a devise used to monitor ongoing email
traffic on a real-time basis and providing the FBI with data after 60 days was not sufficient.
Furthermore, prosecutors informed him that the statute authorizes the government to compensate
a service provider for “reasonable expenses,” and the amount he quoted did not appear to be
reasonable. Mr. Levison responded by email stating that the pen register order, in his opinion,
does not require real-time access (although this fact was discussed at length during the July 10
conference call). Moreover, he indicated that the cost of reissuing the “SSL certificate” (for
encryption service) would be $2000. It was unclear in his email if this $2000 was an additional
expense to be added to the $3500 previously claimed. Mr. Levison indicated that he would try to
contact the person responsible for making his travel arrangements at the United States Attorney’s
office on Sunday afternoon.

9.	On July 15, 2013, Mr. Levison spoke with the person responsible for making his
travel arrangements. He was told that he was booked on a flight from Dallas, Texas, to R.eagan
National Airport departing that same evening. He also had a hotel reservation. Mr. Levison
indicated tha

- 3 -

10.	The proceeding before the Court today is to determine whether Lavabit LLC and
Mr. Levison should be held in civil contempt. Civil contempt, as compared to criminal contempt
under rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, is intended to coerce compliance with
a court order. There are four elements to civil contempt: (1) the existence of valid order of which
Lavabit LLC and Mr. Levison had actual or constructive knowledge; (2) the order was in the
government’s “favor”; (3) Lavabit LLC and Mr. Levison violated the terms of the order and had
knowledge, or constructive knowledge, of such violation; and (4) the government suffered harm
as a result. In re Grand Jury Subpoena (T-l 12), 597 F.3d 189, 202 (4th Cir. 2012).

11.	Flere, each of these elements has been met. Lavabit LLC, through direct
communication between the government and Mr. Levison, its owner and operator, has had actual
knowledge of the pen register order and the subsequent June 28 order of the magistrate judge
compelling compliance with that order. This Court’s show cause order, which was personally
served on Mr. Levison, provided further notice of the violation of those orders by Lavabit LLC.
The government clearly has suffered harm in that it has lost 20 days of information as a result of
non-compliance.

12.	Lavabit LLC may comply with the pen register order by simply allowing the FBI
to install the pen register devise and provide the FBI with the encryption keys. If Lavabit LLC
informs the Court it will comply with the order, the government will not seek sanctions. If,
how'ever, Mr. Levison informs the Court that Lavabit LLC will not comply, the government
requests that the Court impose a fine of $1000 per day, commencing July 17, 2013, until Lavabit
LLC fully complies with the pen register order.

13.	To the extent that Lavabit LLC takes the position that the pen register does not

-4-

authorize the production of the encryption keys, the government has asked the Court to authorize
the seizure of that information pursuant to a warrant under Title 18, United States Code, Section
2703, thus rendering this argument moot.

14.	The Court has sealed this proceeding. This pleading has also been filed under seal.
The United States will hand deliver a copy of this pleading to Mr. Levison at today’s hearing.

PROCEEDINGS

THE CLERK:	In Re:	Case No. 1:13 EC 297.

MR. TRUMP:	Good morning, Judge. Jim Trump on behalf

of the United States. With me is Andy Peterson, Brandon
Van Grack from the United States Department of Justice,

Mr. Ben'Ary behind me, and Matt Braverman, special agent for the
FBI.

THE COURT:	All right.

MR. LEVISON:	Ladar Levison, the subject of the

summons.

THE COURT:	All right. Mr. Trump.

MR. TRUMP:	Your Honor, we submitted our supplemental

paper this morning describing the communication we've had with
Lavabit, LLC, through Mr. Levison. And I think, very simply, we
would like this Court to inquire of Mr. Levison whether he
intends to comply with the pen register order which would
require him to allow the FBI access to his server to install a
device which will extract data, filter that data, and provide
that data to the FBI, and to provide the FBI with the encryption
keys to the extent there is encrypted information, included
among within the body of information called for by the pen
register order.

As the Court is aware, and as we will provide with
Mr. Levison, we obtained a search warrant this morning from Your
Honor for the same encryption keys. Thus, to the extent there's

any question as to whether Mr. Levison would be required to
provide these keys, it's now subject both to the pen register
order and the search warrant, the seizure warrant.

That's where we stand, Your Honor. If Mr. Levison
agrees to comply with the order, we would not seek any
sanctions. We would ask that he be directed to forthwith make
his servers available so the FBI can install that device and to
extract the encryption keys.

If, however, he informs the Court he is not willing to
comply with the order, we would ask the Court to impose
sanctions. We suggested in our pleading a thousand dollars a
day to be paid to the United States government until he
complies. If he doesn't comply with that sanction, then we
would be back in court seeking additional sanctions or charging
additional offenses.

THE COURT:	All right. Mr. Levison.

MR. LEVISON:	Good morning, Your Honor. I'm not sure

what order I should make these in, but I would like to request a
couple of things by motion.

I'd like to move that all of the nonsensitive portions
of the documents that were provided, i.e., everything except the
account in question, be unsealed. I believe it's important for
the industry and the people to understand what the government is
requesting by demanding that I turn over these encryption keys
for the entire service.

iHE COURT:	All right. What do you say to that,

Mr. Trump? Deal with the motions before I —

MR. TRUMP:	What Mr. Levison is trying to do, Your

Honor, is invite industry to come in and litigate as a surrogate
for him the issue of whether the encryption keys are part and
parcel of the pen register order. And that's one of the reasons
we sought the search warrant, to make it clear, whether through
the search warrant or pen register order, he is required to
provide these keys.

We know he’s been in contact with attorneys who also
represent industry groups and others who have litigated issues
like this in the WikiLeaks context and others. But we would
object to unsealing this matter because it's just Mr. —

THE COURT:	And they've done that in connection with

the issuance of a pen register?

MR. TRUMP:	They have litigated privacy-related issues

in the context of process under 2703. I'm not sure — not a pen
register, but with respect to 2703.

But we discussed this issue with Mr. Levison and his
counsel by conference call. We indicated that the only data
that the government seeks is that which is required by the pen
register order. That it's just the basic header to e-mail
traffic, sender, recipient, time, duration, that sort of thing.

If Mr. Levison wants to object to providing the keys,
he can certainly object to doing that and then we can proceed

from there, but I don't think he's entitled to try to make this
a public proceeding to invite others in to litigate those issues
on his behalf.

THE COURT:	All right. Well, I believe that to be

correct. I mean, this is a criminal investigation. A pen
register has been ordered and is here at issue, and any motion
to unseal that will be denied.

You said you had another motion, I believe?

MR. LEVISON:	Yeah. My issue is only with the SSL

keys. So if that is litigated separately and that portion of
the proceeding is unsealed, I’m comfortable with that.

THE COURT:	I don't understand what you’re saying,

separate proceedings.

MR. LEVISON:	Sorry. I have always agreed to the

installation of the pen register device. I have only ever
objected to turning over the SSL keys because that would
compromise all of the secure communications in and out of my
network, including my own administrative traffic.

THE COURT:	Well, didn't my order already include that?

MR. LEVISON:	I do not believe so, sir.

THE COURT: Did my initial order — I don’t recall at
the moment. Did my initial order recall the encrypted devices
with the installation of a pen register?

MR. TRUMP:	The pen register, as issued, just required

all assistance, technical assistance, facilities, and

information, to facilitate the pen register.

This morning the search warrant required —

THE COURT:	Yeah, but the search warrant's a different

matter now. That's not before me this morning. The only thing
that's before me this morning is the pen register.

MR. TRUMP:	Correct.

THE COURT:	So as I understand it, my initial order

ordered nothing but that the pen register be put in place.

MR. TRUMP:	And all technical assistance, information,

and facilities necessary to implement the pen register. And
it's our position that without the encryption keys, the data
from the pen register will be meaningless. So to facilitate the
actual monitoring required by the pen register, the FBI also
requires the encryption keys.

THE COURT:	Well, that could be, but I don't know that

I need — I don’t know that I need to reach that because I’ve
issued a search warrant for that.

MR. TRUMP:	Correct, Your Honor. That the — to avoid

litigating this issue, we asked the Court to enter the seizure
warrant.

THE COURT:	Well, what I'm saying is if he agrees that

the pen register be established, and that the only thing he
doesn't want to do in connection with the pen register is to
give up the encryption device or code —

MR. LEVISON:	I've always maintained that.

THE COURT:	— so we've got no issue here. You're

ready to do that?

MR. LEVISON:	I've been ready to do that since Agent

Howard spoke to me the first time.

THE COURT:	All right. So that ends our —

MR. TRUMP:	Well, then we have to inquire of

Mr. Levison whether he will produce the encryption keys pursuant
to the search warrant that Your Honor just signed.

THE COURT:	But I can't deal with that this morning,

can I?

MR. TRUMP:	Well, it's the same issue. You could ask

him, Your Honor. We can serve him with the warrant and ask him
if he’s going to comply rather than —

MR. LEVISON:	Your Honor, I've also been issued a

subpoena demanding those same keys, which I brought with me in
the event that we would have to address that subpoena.

THE COURT:	I don't know, Mr. Trump. I don't think I

want to get involved in asking him. You can talk with him and
see whether he's going to produce them or not and let him tell
you. But I don't think I ought to go asking what he's going to
do and what he's not going to do because I can't take any action
about it anyway.

If he does not comply with the subpoena, there are
remedies for that one way or another.

MR. TRUMP:	Well, the original pen register order was

followed by a compulsion order from Judge Buchanan. The
compulsion order required the encryption keys to be produced.

So, yes, part of the show cause order is to require
compliance both with the pen register order and the compulsion
order issued by Judge Buchanan.

Ap.d that order, which was attached to the show cause
order, states, "To the extent any information, facilities, or
technical assistance are under the control of Lavabit are needed
to provide the FBI with the encrypted data, Lavabit shall
provide such information, facilities, or technical assistance
forthwith."

MR. LEVISON:	I would object to that statement. I

don't know if I'm wording this correctly, but what was in that
order to compel was a statement that was incorrect.

Agent Howard seemed to believe that I had the ability
to encrypt the e-mail content stored on our servers, which is
not the case. I only have the keys that govern communications
into and out of the network, and those keys are used to secure
the traffic for all users, not just the user in question.

So the statement in that order compelling me to decrypt
stuff and Agent Howard stating that I have the ability to do
that is technically false or incorrect. There was never an
explicit demand that I turn over these keys.

THE COURT:	I don't know what bearing that would have,

would it? I mean, I don't have a problem — Judge Buchanan

issued an order in addition to mine, and I'm not sure I ought to
be enforcing Judge Buchanan's order.

My order, if he says that he will produce or allow the
installation of the pen register, and in addition I have issued
a search warrant for the codes that you want, which I did this

that s been entered, it seems that this issue is over
as far as I'm concerned except I need to see that he allows the
pen register and complies with the subpoena.

MR. TRUMP:	Correct.

THE COURT:	If he doesn't comply -- if he doesn't

comply with the subpoena, then that has — I have to address
that.

MR. TRUMP:	Right.

THE COURT:	But right now there's nothing for me to

address here unless he is not telling me correctly about the pen
register.

MR. TRUMP:	Well, we can — Your Honor, if we can talk

to Mr. Levison for five minutes, we can ask him whether he will
honor the warrant that you just issued.

MR. LEVISON:	Before we do that, can I —

THE COURT:	Well, what can I do about it if he doesn't,

if he tells you he's not going to? You've got the right to go
out and search and get it.

MR. TRUMP:	Well, we can't get the information without

his assistance. He's the only who knows and has possession of

it. We can't take it from him involuntarily.

MR. LEVISON:	If I may, sir, my other —

THE COURT:	Wait just a second.

You're trying to get me ahead. You're trying to get me
to deal with a contempt before there's any contempt, and I have
a problem with that.

MR. TRUMP:	I'm trying to avoid contempt altogether,

Your Honor.

THE COURT: I know you are. And I'd love for you-all
to get together and do that. I don't want to deal with it
either. But I don't think we can sit around and agree that
there’s going to be a default and I will address it before it
occurs.

MR. TRUMP:	I'm just trying to figure out whether

there's going to be a default. We'll take care of that, Judge.

THE COURT:	You can. I think the way we've got to do

this -- and I'll listen to you. I'm cutting you off, I know,
but I'll listen to you in a minute.

The way we have to do this, the hearing that's before
me this morning on this issue of the pen register, that's been
resolved, or so he's told me. I don't know whether you want to
continue this one week and see if he complies with that, which I
guess would be prudent to do, or a few days for him to comply
with the pen register. Then we will wait and see what happens
with the subpoena.

Because as far as my pen register order is concerned,
he says he's going to comply with it. So that issue's over and
done with. The next issue will be whether or not he complies
with the subpoena. And I don't know and I don't want to
presume, and I don't want him to represent to me what he intends
to do when he can very well go home and decide he's going to do
something different.

When that warrant is served, we'll know what he’s going
to do. I think we've got — I don't see another way to do it.

MR. TRUMP:	That's fine, Your Honor. We will serve the

warrant on him as soon as we conclude this hearing, and we'll
find out whether he will provide the keys or not.

THE COURT:	Okay. Now, did you want to say anything

else?

MR. LEVISON:	Well, I mean, I've always maintained that

all the government needs to do is contact me and set up an
appointment to install that pen register. So I don't know why
there has never been any confusion about my willingness to
install it. I've only ever objected to the providing of those
keys which secure any sensitive information going back and
forth.

But my motion, and I'm not sure if it's relevant or not
because it deals more with the issue of the subpoena demanding
the keys and for what will be the forthcoming search warrant,
would be a continuance so that I can retain counsel to address

that particular issue.

THE COURT:	Well, I mean, there's nothing before me

with that. I've issued the subpoena. Whatever happens with
that, that's — you're trying to get me to do what Mr. Trump
wanted to do and to arrange this beforehand.

MR. LEVISON:	Well, I don't know if I have to appear

before that grand jury right now and give the keys over or face
arrest. I'm not a lawyer so I don't understand the procedure.

THE COURT:	I don't know either. You need to have —

it would be wise to have a lawyer.

MR. LEVISON:	Okay.

THE COURT:	I don’t know what’s going to happen. I

don't know. They haven't served the warrant yet. I have no
idea. Don't know what's going to happen with it. You'll just
have to figure that out, and it be wise to have a lawyer to do
it, I would think.

MR. LEVISON:	I guess while I'm here in regards to the

pen register, would it be possible to request some sort of
external audit to ensure that your orders are followed to the
letter in terms of the information collected and preserved?

THE COURT:	No. The law provides for those things, and

any other additional or extra monitoring you might want or think
is appropriate will be denied, if that's what you're requesting.

MR. LEVISON:	Okay. I mean, it requests that the

government return to the Court records —

regard. Your lawyer can fill you in if you want to know.

MR. LEVISON:	I've always been willing to accept the

device. I just have some concern about ensuring that it's used
properly.

THE COURT:	Should we continue this to some specific

date to see that he complies with the pen register?

without the encryption keys.

MR. TRUMP:	That's a practical --

THE COURT: — but I don't think it is a moot issue. I
mean, you-all have got the right to go in and put on that pen
register. He says that he will do it. That's all that I've
ordered.

Now, the other business about ordering that, Judge
Buchanan made an order that he's going to have to supply what
you say is the encryption codes to make the information useful.

I don't know. I didn't enter that order. I have trouble making
that connection.

do something in front of Judge Buchanan or not.

return to Dallas.

MR. LEVISON:	I'm not available within hours of my

THE COURT:	The 26th?

MR. LEVISON:	Acceptable to me.

THE COURT:	We'll continue it to the 26th, and that's

for determining whether or not that pen register has been
installed as you request.

We can make it 10 o'clock.

No. 1:13SW522

In re Grand Jury

No. 13-1

MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA AND SEARCH WARRANT AND
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION

Lavabit LLC (“Lavabit") and Mr. Ladar Levinson (“Mr. Levinson”) move
this Court to quash the grand jury subpoena and search and seizure warrant
served on them by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of tire
United States Attorney (collectively “Government").

BACKGROUND

Lavabit is an encrypted email service provider. As such, Lavabit’s
business model focuses on providing private and secure email accounts to its
customers. Lavabit uses various encryption methods, including secured socket
layers (“SSL"), to protect its users' privacy. Lavabit maintains an encryption

1

key, which may be used by authorized users decrypt data and communications
from its server {“Master Key7'). The Government has commanded Lavabit, by a
subpoena1 and a search and seizure warrant, to produce the encryption keys
and SSL keys used by lavabit.com in order to access and decrypt

stored in one specific email address
“Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant”).

ARGUMENT

If the Government gains access to Lavabit's Master Key, it will have

unlimited access to not	Account”), but.

all of the communications and data stored in each of Lavabit’s 400,000 email

accounts. None of these other users' email accounts are at issue in this

matter. However, production of the Master Key will compromise the security of

these users. While Lavabit is willing to cooperate with the Government

regarding the Email Account, Lavabit has a duty to maintain the security for

the rest of its customers’ accounts. The Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant are

not narrowly tailored to seek only data and communications relating to the

Email Account in question. As a result, the Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant are

unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

a.	The Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant Essentially Amounts to a
General Warrant.

communications and data

1 The grand jury subpoena not only commanded Mr. Levinson to appear before this Court on
July 16, 2013, but also to bring Lavabit’s encryption keys. Mr. Levinson’s subpoena to appear
before the grand jury was withdrawn, but the government continues to seek the encryption
keys. Lavabit is only seeking to quash the Court’s command that Mr. Levinson provide the
encryption keys.

2

• Though the Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant superficially appears to be
narrowly tailored, in reality, it operates as a general warrant by giving the
Government access to every Lavabit user’s communications and data.

It is not what the Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant defines as the boundaries for
the search, but the method of providing access for the search which amounts to
a general warrant.

It is axiomatic that the Fourth Amendment prohibits general warrants.
Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 480 (1976). Indeed “it is familiar history
that indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the authority of
‘general warrants’ were the immediate evils that motivated the framing and
adoption of the Fourth Amendment.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 583
(1980) (footnote omitted). To avoid general warrants, the Fourth Amendment
requires that “the place to be searched” and “the persons or things to be seized”
be described with particularity. United States v. Moore, 775 F. Supp. 2d 882,
898 (E.D. Va. 2011) (quoting United States v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90, 97 (2006)).

The Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement is meant to “prevent)]
the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another." Andresen, 427
U.S. at 480. This is precisely the concern with the Lavabit Subpoena and
Warrant and, in this circumstance, the particularity requirement will not
protect Lavabit. By turning over the Master Key, the Government will have the
ability to search each and every “place,” “person [and] thing” on Lavabit's
network.

3

•	The Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant allows the Government to do a

“general, exploratory rummaging” through any Lavabit user account. See id.
(quoting Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 467 (1971)) (describing the
issue with general warrants “is not that of intrusion per se, but of a general,
exploratory rummaging in a person's belongings”). Though the Lavabit
■ Subpoena and Warrant is facially limited to the Email Address, the
Government would be able to seize communications, data and information from
any account once it is given the Master Key.

There is nothing other than the “discretion of the officer executing the
warrant” to prevent an invasion of other Lavabit user’s accounts and private
emails. See id. at 492 (quoting Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 485 (1965))
(explaining that the purpose of the particularity requirement of the Fourth
Amendment is to ensure, with regards to what is taken that, “nothing is left to
the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.”) (internal citation omitted).
Lavabit has no assurance that any searches conducted utilizing the Master Key
will be limited solely to the Email Account. See Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551,
561-62 (2004) (citing Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San
Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 532 (1967)) (noting that a particular warrant is to
provide individuals with assurance “of the lawful authority of the executing
officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search) (emphasis
added). Lavabit has a duty to its customers to protect their accounts from the
possibility of unlawful intrusions by third parties, including government
entities.

4

As the Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant arc currently framed they are
invalid as they operate as a general warrant, allowing the Government to
search individual users not subjection to this suit, without limit.

b.	The Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant Seeks Information that Is

Not Material to the Investigation.

Because of the breadth of Warrant and Subpoena, the Government will be
given access to data and communications that are wholly unrelated to the suit.
The Government, by commanding Lavabit’s encryption keys, is acquiring
access to 400,000 user's private accounts in order to gain information about
one individual. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) states that a court order may be issued for
information "relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.”
However, the Government will be given unlimited access, through the Master
Key, to several hundred thousand user’s information, all of who are not
"material” to the investigation. Id.

Additionally, the (Government has no probable cause to gain access to the
other users accounts. "The Fourth Amendment...requires that a warrant be no
broader than the probable cause on which it is based.” Moore, 775 F. Supp. 2d
at 897 (quoting United States v. Hurwitz, 459 F.3d 463, 473 (4th Cir. 2006)).
Probable cause here is based on the activities of the individual linked to the
Email Address. Other Lavabit users would be severely impacted by the
Government’s access to the Master Key and have not been accused of
wrongdoing or criminal activity in relation to this suit. Their privacy interests
should not suffer because of the alleged misdeeds of another Lavabit user.

5

c.	Compliance with Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant Would Cause
an Undue Burden.

As a non-party and unwilling participant to this suit, Lavabit has already
incurred legal fees and other costs in order to comply with the Court’s orders.
Further compliance, by turning over the Master Key and granting the
Government access to its entire network, would be unduly burdensome. See
18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) (stating that “the service provider may [move to] quash or
modify [an] order, if the information or records requested are unusually
voluminous in nature or compliance with such order otherwise would cause an
undue burden on such provider.") (emphasis added).

The recent case of In re Application of the U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18
U.S.C. 2703(d) (“Twitted) addresses similar issues. 830 F. Supp. 2d 114 (E.D.
Va. 2011). In that case, the Petitioners failed to allege “a personal injury
cognizable by the Fourth Amendment." Id. at 138. However, Lava bit’s
circumstances are distinguishable. The Government, in pursuit of information
date and communications related to the Email Address, has caused and will
continue to cause injury to Lavabit. Not only has Lavabit expended a great
deal of time and money in attempting to cooperate with the Government thus
far, but, Lavabit will pay the ultimate price—the loss of its customers’ trust and
business—should the Court require that the Master Key be turned over.
Lavabit’s business, which is founded on the preservation of electronic privacy,
could be destroyed if it is required to produce its Master Key.

6

Lavabit- is also a fundamentally different entity than Twitter, the business
at issue in Twitter. The Twitter Terms of Service specifically allowed user
information to be disseminated. Id. at 139. Indeed, the veiy purpose of Twitter
is for users to publically post their musings and beliefs on the Internet. In
contrast, Lavabit is dedicated to keeping its user’s information private and
secure. Additionally, the order in Twitter did not seek “content information”
from Twitter users, as is being sought here. Id. The Government’s request for
Lavabit’s Master Key gives it access to data and communications from 400,000
email secure accounts, which is much more sensitive information that at issue
in the Twitter.

The Government is attempting, in complete disregard of the Fourth
Amendment, to penetrate a system that was founded for the sole purpose of
■ privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360 (1967) (stating that “the
touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis is whether a person has a
constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy”) (internal citations
omitted). For Lavabit. t.o grant the Government unlimited access to every one of
its user’s accounts would be to disavow its duty to its users and the principals
upon which it was founded. Lavabit’s service will be rendered devoid of
economic value if the Government is granted access to its secure network. The
Government does not have any proper basis to request that Lavabit blindly
produce its Master Key and subject all of its users to invasion of privacy.

Moreover, the Master Key itself is an encryption developed and owned by
Lavabit. As such it is valuable proprietary information and Lavabit has a

7

reasonable expectation in protecting it. Because Lavabit has a reasonable
expectation of privacy for its Master Key, the Lavabit Subpoena and Warrant
violate the F'ourth Amendment. See Twitter, 830 F. Supp. 2d at 141 (citing
United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 346 (1974)) (noting 'The grand jury
is..-without power to invade a legitimate privacy interest protected by the
Fourth Amendment" and that “a grand jury's subpoena...will be disallowed if it
is far too sweeping in its terms to be...reasonable under the Fourth
Amendment.”).	.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Lavabit and Mr. Levinson respectfully move

this Court to quash the search and seizure warrant and grand jury subpoena.

Further, Lavabit and Mr. Levinson request that this Court direct that Lavabit

does not have to produce its Master Key. Alternatively, Lavabit and Mr.

Levinson request that they be given an opportunity to revoke the current

encryption key and reissue a new encryption key at the Government’s expense.

Lastly, Lavabit and Mr. Levinson request that, if they is required to produce the

Master Key, that they be reimbursed for its costs which were directly incurred

in producing the Master Key, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2706.

No. 13-1

MOTION FOR UNSEALING OF SEALED COURT RECORDS AND REMOVAL
OF NON-DISCLOSURE ORDER AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT

OF MOTION

Lavabit, LLC (“Lavabit”) and Mr. Ladar Levinson (“Mr. Levinson")
(collectively “Movants”) move this Court to unseal the court records concerning
the United States government's attempt to obtain certain encryption keys and
lift the non-disclosure order issued to Mr. Levinson. Specifically, Movants
request the unsealing of all orders and documents filed in this matter before
the Court’s issuance of the July 16, 2013 Sealing Order (“Sealing Order”); (2)
all orders and documents filed in this matter after the issuance of the Sealing
Order; (3) all grand jury subpoenas and search and seizure warrants issued
before or after issuance of the Sealing Order; and (4) all documents filed in

J

connection with such orders or requests for such orders (collectively, the
“sealed documents"). The Sealing Order is attached as Exhibit A. Movants
request that all of the sealed documents be unsealed and made public as
quickly as possible, with only those redactions necessary to secure information
that the Court deems, after review, to be properly withheld.

BACKGROUND

Lavabit was formed in 2004 as a secure and encrypted email service
provider. To ensure security, Lavabit employs multiple encryption schemes
using complex access keys. Today, it provides email service to roughly 400,000
users worldwide. Lavabit’s corporate philosophy is user anonymity and
privacy. Lavabit employs secure socket layers (“SSL”) to ensure the privacy of
Lavabit’s subscribers through encryption. Lavabit possesses a master
encryption key to facilitate the private communications of its users.

On July 16, 2013, this Court entered an Order pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
2705(b), directing Movants to disclose all information necessary to decrypt
communications sent to or from and data stored or otherwise associated with

including SSL keys (the
“Lavabit Order”). The Lavabit Order is attached as Exhibit B. The Lavabit
Order precludes the Movants from notifying any person of tire search and
seizure warrant, or the Court’s Order in issuance thereof, except that Lavabit
was permitted to disclose the search warrant to an attorney for legal advice.

ARGUMENT

the Lavabit e-mail account

2

In criminal trials there is a common law presumption of access to judicial
records, like the sealed documents in the present case. Despite the
government’s legitimate interests, it cannot meet its burden and overcome this
presumption because it has not explored reasonable alternatives.

Furthermore, the government’s notice preclusion order constitutes a content-
based restriction on free speech by prohibiting public discussion of an entire
topic based on its subject matter.

I.	THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND NON DISCLOSURE ORDERS

The Stored Communications Act (“SCA") authorizes notice preclusion to
any person of a § 2705(b) order’s existence, but only if the Court has reason to
believe that notification will result in (1) endangering the life or physical safety
of an individual; (2) flight from prosecution; (3) destruction or tampering with
evidence; (4) intimidating of potential witnesses; or (5) otherwise seriously
jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial. § 2705(b)(l)-(5).

Despite this statutory authority, the § 2705(b) gag order infringes upon
freedom of speech under the First Amendment, and should be subjected to
constitutional case law.

The most searching form of review, “strict scrutiny”, is implicated when
there is a content-based restriction on free speech. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,
Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 403 (1992). Such a restriction must be necessary to serve
a compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that end. Id. The
Lavabit Order’s non-disclosure provision is a content-based restriction that is
not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.

3

a.	The Lavabit Order Regulates Mr. Levinson's Free Speech

. The notice preclusion order at issue here limits Mr, Levinson’s speech in
that he is not allowed to disclose the existence of the § 2705(b) order, or the
underlying investigation to any other person including any other Lavabit
subscriber. This naked prohibition against disclosure can fairly be
characterized as a regulation of pure speech. Bartnidti v. Vopper, 532 U.S.

514, 526 (2001). A regulation that limits the time, place, or manner of speech
is permissible if it serves a significant governmental interest and provides
ample alternative channels for communication. See Cox v. New Hampshire,
312 U.S. 569, 578 (1941) (explaining that requiring a permit for parades was
aimed at policing the streets rather than restraining peaceful picketing).
However, a valid time, place, and manner restriction cannot be based on the
content or subject matter of the speech. Consol. Edison Co. of New York v. Pub.
Serv. Comm’n of New York, 447 U.S. 530, 536 (1980).

The gag order in the present case is content-based because it precludes
speech on an entire topic, namely the search and seizure warrant and the
underlying criminal investigation. See id. at 537 (‘The First Amendments
hostility to content-based regulation extends... to prohibition of public
discussion of an entire topic”). While the nondisclosure provision may be
viewpoint neutral on its face, it nevertheless functions as a content-based
restriction because it closes off an “entire topic" from public discourse.

. It is true that the government has a compelling interest in maintaining

4

Levinson has been unjustly restrained from contacting Lavabit subscribers who
could be subjected to government surveillance if Mr. Levinson were forced to
comply the Lavabit Order. Lavabit’s value is embodied in its complex
encryption keys, which provide its subscribers with privacy and security. Mr.

. Levinson has been unwilling to turn over these valuable keys because they
grant access to his entire network. In order to protect Lavabit, which caters to
thousands of international clients, Mr. Levinson needs some ability to voice his
concerns, gamer support for his cause, and take precautionary steps to ensure
that Lavabit remains a truly secure network.

b.	The Lavabit Order Constitutes A Prior Restraint On Speech
Besides restricting content, the § 2705(b) non-disclosure order forces a
prior restraint on speech. It is well settled that an ordinance, which makes the
enjoyment of Constitutional guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will
of an official, is a prior restraint of those freedoms. Shuttlesworth v.

Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 150-151 (1959); Staub v. City of Bcodey, 355 U.S.
313, 322 (1958). By definition, a prior restraint is an immediate and
irreversible sanction because it “freezes” speech. Nebraska Press Ass'n v.

Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559 (1976). In the present case, the Lavabit Order,
enjoins Mr. Levinson from discussing these proceedings with any other person.
The effect is an immediate freeze on speech.

The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted the First
Amendment as providing greater protection from prior restraints. Alexander v.
United States, 509 U.S. 544 (1993). Prior restraints carry a heavy burden for

5

justification, with a presumption against constitutional validity. Capital Cities
Media, Inc. v. Toole, 463 U:S. 1303, 1305 (1983); Carroll v. Princess Anne, 393
U.S. 175, 181 (1968); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963).
Here, the government and the Court believe that notification of the search
warrant’s existence will seriously jeopardize the investigation, by giving targets
an opportunity to flee or continue flight from prosecution, will destroy or
tamper with evidence, change patterns of behavior, or notify confederates. See
Lavabit Order. However, the government’s interest in the integrity of its
investigation does not automatically supersede First Amendment rights. See
Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 841 (1978) (holding
the confidentiality of judicial review insufficient to justify encroachment on the
freedom of speech).

In the present case, the government has a legitimate interest in tracking
the accountHowever, if Lavabit were forced to
surrender its master encryption key, the government would have access not
only to this account, but also every Lavabit account. Without the ability to
disclose government access to users’ encrypted data, public debate about the
scope and justification for this secret investigatory tool will be stifled.

Moreover, innocent Lavabit subscribers will not know that Lavabit’s security
devices have been compromised. Therefore the § 2705(b) non-disclosure order
should be lifted to provide Mr. Levinson the ability to ensure the value and
integrity of Lavabit for his other subscribers.

6

IT. THE LAW SUPPORTS THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE
SEALED DOCUMENTS

Despite any statutory authority, the Lavabit Order and all related
documents were filed under seal. The sealing of judicial records imposes a
limit.on the public’s right of access, which derives from two sources, the First
Amendment and the common law. Va. Dep't of State Police v. Wash. Post, 386
F.3d 567, 575 (4th Cir. 2004); See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448
U.S. 555, 580 (press and public have a First Amendment right of attend a
criminal trial); Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 2 (1986) (right
of access to preliminary hearing and transcript).

a. The Common Law Right Of Access Attaches To The Lavabit Order
For a right of access to a document to exist under either the First
Amendment or the common law, the document must be a “judicial record.”
Baltimore Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 63-64 (4th Cir. 1989). Although the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has never formally defined “judicial record”, it
held that § 2703(d) orders and subsequent orders issued by the court are
judicial records because they are judicially created. In re U.S. for.an Order
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), 707 F.3d 283, 290 (4th Cir. 2013)

(“Twitter”). The § 2705(b) order in the present case was issued pursuant to §
2703(d) and can properly be defined as a judicial record. Although the Fourth
Circuit has held there is no First Amendment right to access § 2703(d) orders,
it held that the common law presumption of access attaches to such
documents. Tivitter, 707 F.3d at 291.

7

The underlying investigation in Twitter, involved a § 2703(d) order, which
directed Twitter to provide personal information, account information, records,
financial data, direct messages to and from email addresses, and Internet
.Protocol addresses for eight of its subscribers, In re: § 2703(d) Order, 787 F.
Supp. 2d 430, 435 (E.D. Va. 2011). Citing the importance of investigatory
secrecy and integrity, the court in that case denied the petitioners Motion to
Unseal, finding no First Amendment or common law right to access. Id. at 443.

Unlike Twitter, whose users publish comments on a public forum,
subscribers use Lavabit for its encrypted features, which ensure security and
privacy. In Tiuitter there was no threat that any user would be subject to
surveillance other than the eight users of interest to the government. However,
a primary concern in this case is that the Lavabit Order provides the
government with access to every Lavabit account.

Although the secrecy of SCA investigations is a compelling government
interest, the hundreds of thousands of Lavabit subscribers that would be
compromised by the Lavabit Order are not the subjects of any justified
government investigation. Therefore access to these private accounts should
not be treated as a simple corollary to an order requesting information on one
criminal subject. The public should have access to these orders because their
effect constitutes a seriously concerning expansion of grand jury subpoena
power.

To overcome the common law presumption of access, a court must find
that there is a “significant countervailing interest” in support of sealing that

8

outweighs the public’s interest in openness. Twitter, 707 F.3d at 293. Under
the common law, the decision to seal or grant access to warrant papers is
within the discretion of the judicial officer who issued the warrant. Media
General Operations, Inc. v. Buchanan, 417 F.3d 424, 429 (4th Cir. 2005). If a
judicial officer determines that full public access is not appropriate, she must
consider alternatives to sealing, which may include granting some public
access or releasing a redacted version of the documents. Id.

In Twitter the court explained that because the magistrate judge
individually considered the documents, and redacted and unsealed certain
documents, he satisfied the procedural requirements for sealing. Twitter, 707
F.3d at 294. However, in the present case, there is no evidence that
alternatives were considered, that documents were redacted, or that any
documents were unsealed. Once the presumption or access attaches, a court
cannot seal documents or records indefinitely unless the government
demonstrates that some significant interest heavily outweighs the public
interest in openness. Wash. Post, 386 F.3d at 575. Despite the government's
concerns, there are reasonable alternatives to an absolute seal that must be
explored in order to ensure the integrity of this investigation.

b.	There Is No Statutory Authority To Seal The § 2705(d)

Documents

There are no provisions in the SCA that mention the sealing of orders or
other documents. In contrast, the Pen/Trap Statute authorizes electronic
surveillance and directs that pen/trap orders be sealed “until otherwise

9

ordered by the court”. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27. Similarly, the Wiretap Act,

• another surveillance statute, expressly directs that applications and orders
granted under its provisions be sealed. 18 U.S.G. § 2518(8)(b). The SCA’s
failure to provide for sealing is not a congressional oversight. Rather, Congress
has specifically provided for sealing provisions when it desired. Where
Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it
in another, it is generally assumed that Congress acts intentionally. Keene
Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 208 (1993). Therefore, there is no
statutory basis for sealing an application or order under the SCA that would
overcome the common law right to access.

c.	Privacy Concerns Demand A Common Law Public Right Of Access

To The Sealed Documents

The leaking of classified government practices by Edward Snowden and
the ensuing mass surveillance scandal have sparked an intense national and
international debate about government surveillance, privacy rights and other
traditional freedoms. It is concerning that suppressing Mr. Levinson’s speech
and pushing its subpoena power to the limits, the government’s actions may be
viewed as accomplishing another unfounded secret infringement on personal
privacy. A major concern is that this could cause people worldwide to abandon
American service providers in favor of foreign businesses because the United
States cannot be trusted to regard privacy.1 It is in the best interests of the
Movant’s and the government that the documents in this matter not be

shrouded in secrecy and used to further unjustified surveillance activities and

to suppress public debate,

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Lavabit respectfully moves this Court to
unseal the court records concerning the United States government's attempt to
obtain certain encryption keys and lift the non-disclosure order issued on Mr.

• Levinson. Alternatively, Lavabit requests that all of the sealed documents be
redacted to secure only the information that the Court deems, after review, to
be properly withheld.

RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION
TO LAVABIT’S MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA AND
MOTION TO FOR UNSEALING OF SEALED COURT RECORDS

INTRODUCTION

This Court has ordered Lavabit, LLC to provide the government with the

technical assistance necessary to implement and use a pen register and trap and trace
device (*‘pen-trap device”). A full month after that order, and after an order to compel
compliance, a grand jury subpoena, and a search warrant for that technical assistance,
Lavabit has still not complied. Repeated efforts to seek that technical assistance from
Lavabit’s owner have failed. While the government continues to work toward a mutually
acceptable solution, at present there does not appear to be a way to implement this

Court’s order, as well as to comply with the subpoena and search warrant, without
requiring Lavabit to disclose an encryption key to the government. This Court’s orders,
search warrant, and the grand jury subpoena all compel that result, and they are all
lawful. Accordingly, Lavabit’s motion to quash the search warrant and subpoena should
be denied.

Lavabit and its owner have also moved to unseal all records in this matter and lift
the order issued by the Court preventing them from disclosing a search warrant issued in
this case. Because public discussion of these records would alert the target and
jeopardize an active criminal investigation, the government’s compelling interest in
maintaining the secrecy and integrity of that investigation outweighs any public right of
access to, or interest in publicly discussing, those records, and this motion should also be
denied.

TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

Pen registers and trap and trace devices

To investigate Internet communications. Congress has permitted law enforcement
to employ two surveillance techniques—the pen register and the trap and trace device—
that permit law' enforcement to learn information about an individual’s communications.
See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27 ( “Pen-Trap Act”). These techniques, collectively known as a
“pen-trap,” permit law enforcement to leam facts about e-mails and other
communications as they are sent—but not to obtain their content. See, e.g., United States
v. Forrester, 512 F.3d 500, 509-13 (9th Cir. 2008) (upholding government’s use of a pen-
trap that “enabled the government to leam the to/from addresses of Alba’s e-mail

2

messages, the TP addresses of the websites that Alba visited and the total volume of
information sent to or from his account”).

The Pen-'frap Act “unambiguously authorize[sJ the use of pen registers and trap
and trace devices on e-mail accounts.” In Matter of Application ofU.S. For an Order
Authorizing the Installation & Use of a Pen Register & a Trap & Trace Device on E-Mail
Account. 416 F. Supp. 2d 13, 14 (D.D.C. 2006) (Hogan, J.) (“Hogan Order”). It
authorizes both the installation of a “device,” meaning, a separate computer attached to
the provider’s network, and also a “process,” meaning, a software program run on the
provider. Id. at 16; 18 U.S.C. § 3127.

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) Encryption

Encrypting communications sent across the Internet is a way to ensure that only
the sender and receiver of a communication can read it. Among the most common
methods of encrypting Web and e-mail traffic is Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which is
also called Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. “The Secure Socket Layer
(‘SSL’) is one method for providing some security for Internet communications. SSL
provides security by establishing a secure channel for communications between a web
browser and the web server; that is, SSL ensures that the messages passed between the
client web browser and the web server are encrypted.” Disney Enterprises. Inc. v. Rea.
No. l:12-CV-687, 2013 WL 1619686 *9 (E.D. Va. Apr. 11,2013); see also Stamblerv.
RSA Sec.. Inc., 2003 WL 22749855 *2-3 (D. Del. 2003) (describing SSL’s technical
operation).

As with most forms of encryption, SSL relies on the use of large numbers known
as “keys.” Keys are parameters used to encrypt or decrypt data. Specifically, SSL

3

encryption employs public-key cryptography, in which both the sender and receiver each
have two mathematically linked keys: a “public” key and a “private” key. “Public” keys
are published, but “private” keys are not. Sending an encrypted message to someone
requires knowing his or her public key; decrypting that message requires knowing his or
her private key.

When Internet traffic is encrypted with SSL, capturing non-content information
on e-mail communication from a pen-trap device is possible only after the traffic is
decrypted. Because Internet communications closely intermingle content with non-
contcnt, pen-trap devices by necessity scan network traffic but exclude from any report to
law enforcement officers all information relating to the subject line and body of the
communication. See 18 U.S.C. § 3127; Hogan Order, 416 F. Supp. 2d at 17-18. A pen-
trap device, by definition, cannot expose to law enforcement officers the content of any
communication. See id.

FACTS

The information at issue before the court is relevant to an ongoing criminal

4

A. Section 2703(d) Order

The criminal investigation has revealed that

electronic communications service provider.

has utilized and continues
obtained through Lavabit. an

On June 10, 2013, the
United States obtained an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) directing Lavabit to
provide, within ten days, additional records and information about fl^^HH?-mail
account. Lavabit’s owner and operator, Mr. Ladar Levison, provided very little of the
information sought by the June 10, 2013 order.

B. Pen-Trap Order

On June 28, 2013, the Honorable Theresa C. Buchanan entered an Order pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. § 3123 authorizing the installation and use of pen-tTap device on all
electronic communications being sent from or sent to the electronic mail account

■ T\ 1r;:' • >r :v: "	/	■

government to capture all (i) “non-content” dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling
in:', nr. at ¡on scr: ' or	ii) t record the date and

time of the initiation and receipt of such transmissions, to record the duration of the
transmissions, and to record user log-in data on	for a

period of sixty days. Judge Buchanan further ordered Lavabit to furnish agents of the
Federal Bureau ol’Invesligation (“FBI”), “forthwith, all information, facilities, and
technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation and use of the pen-trap

5

device.” Pen-Trap Order at 2. The government was also ordered to “take reasonable
steps to ensure that the monitoring equipment is not used to capture any” content-related
information. Id. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3123(d), Judge Buchanan ordered that the Pen-
Trap Order and accompanying application be sealed. Id.

Later on June 28, 2013, two FBI Special Agents served a copy of the Pen-Trap
Order on Mr. Levison. Mr. Levison informed the FBI Special Agents that emails were
encrypted as they were transmitted to and from the Lavabit server as well as when they
were stored on the Lavabit server. In addition, decryption keys would be necessary to
access any e-mails. Mr. Levison did not provide the keys to the Agents in that meeting.

In an email to Mr. Levison on July 6,2013, a FBI Special Agent re-affirmed the nature of
the information requested in the pen-trap order. In a response on the same day, Levison
claimed “we don’t record this data”.

C.	Compliance Order

Mr. Levison did not comply with the Pen-Trap Order. Accordingly, in the
evening of June 28, 2013, the government obtained an Order Compelling Compliance
Forthwith from U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa C. Buchanan (“Compliance Order”). The
Compliance Order directed Lavabit to comply with the Pen-Trap Order and to “provide
the Federal Bureau of Investigation with unencrypted data pursuant to the Order.”

Lavabit was further ordered to provide “any information, facilities, or technical assistance
are under the control of Lavabit [that] are needed to provide the FBI with the unencrypted
data.” Compliance Order at 2. The Compliance Order indicated that failing to comply
would subject Lavabit to any penalty in the power of the court, “including the possibility
of criminal contempt of Court.” Id.

6

D.	Order to Show Cause

Mr. Levison did not comply with the Compliance Order. On July 9, 2013, this
Court ordered Mr. Levison to appear on July 16, 2013, to show cause why Lavabit has
failed to comply with the Pen-Trap Order and Compliance Order.

The following day, on July 10, 2013, the United States Attorney’s Office arranged
a conference call involving the United States Attorney’s Office, the FBI, Mr. Levison and
Mr. Levison’s attorney at the time, Marcia Hofmann. During this call, the parties
discussed implementing the pen-trap device in light of the encryption in place on the
target e-mail account. The FBI explained, and Mr. Levison appeared to agree, that to
install the pen-trap device and to obtain the unencrypted data stream necessary for the
device’s operation the FBI would require (i) access to Lavabit’s server and (ii) encryption
keys.

E.	Grand Jury Subpoena

On July 11,2013, the United States Attorney’s Office issued a grand jury
subpoena for Mr. Levison to testify in front of the grand jury on July 16, 2013. The
subpoena instructed Mr. Levison to bring to tire grand jury his encryption keys and any
other information necessary to accomplish the installation and use of the pen-trap device
pursuant to the Pen-Trap Order.1 The FBI attempted to serve the subpoena on Mr.
Levison at his residence. After knocking on his door, the FBI Special Agents witnessed
Mr. Levison exit his apartment from a back door, get in his car, and drive away. Later in
the evening, the FBI successfully served Mr. Levison with the subpoena.

' The grand jury subpoena was subsequently sealed on July 16,2013.

7

On July 13,2013, Mr. Levison sent an e-mail to Assistant United States Attorney

stating, in part:

In light of the conference call on July 10th and after subsequently reviewing the
requirements of the June 28th order I now believe it would be possible to capture
the required data ourselves and provide it to the FBI. Specifically the information
we’d collect is the login and subsequent logout date and time, the IP address used
to connect to the subject email account and the following non-content headers (if
present) from any future emails sent or received using the subject account. The
headers I currently plan to collect are: To, Cc, From, Date, Reply-To, Sender,
Received. Return-Path, Apparently-To and Alternate-Recipient. Note that
additional header fields could be captured if provided in advance of my
implementation effort.

$2,000 in compensation would be required to cover the cost of the development
time and equipment necessary to implement my solution. The data would then be
collected manually and provided at the conclusion of the 60 day period required
by the Order. I may be able to provide the collected data intermittently during tire
collection period but only as my schedule allows. If the FBI would like to receive
the collected information more frequently I would require an additional $1,500 in
compensation. The additional money would be needed to cover the costs
associated with automating the log collection from different servers and uploading
it to an an FBI server via "scp" on a daily basis. The money would also cover the
cost of adding the process to our automated monitoring system so that 1 would
notified automatically if any problems appeared.

The e-mail again confirmed that Lavabit is capable of providing the means for the FBI to

install the pen-trap device and obtain the requested information in an unencrypted form.

AUS^

replied to Mr. Levison’s e-mail that same day, explaining that the

proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not provide for real-time

transmission of results, and it was not clear that Mr. Levison’s request for money

constituted the "’reasonable expenses” authorized by the statute.

F.	Search Warrant & 2705(b) Non-Disclosure Order

On July 16, 2013, this Court issued a search warrant to Lavabit for (i) “[a]ll

information necessary' to decrypt communications sent to or from the Lavabit e-mail

account

including encryption keys and SSL keys” and (ii)

8

“[a]ll information necessary to decrypt data stored in or otherwise associated with the
Lavabit accouni

ordered Lavabit to not disclose the existence of tine search warrant upon determining that
"there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of the . . . warrant will
seriously jeopardize the investigation, including by giving target an opportunity to flee or
continue flight from prosecution, destroy or tamper with evidence, change patterns of
behavior, or notify confederates.” July 16, 2013 Order (“Non-Disclosure Order”) at 1.

G.	Rule 49 Sealing Order

The search warrant and accompanying materials were further sealed by the Court
on July 16,2013, pursuant to a Local Rule 49(B) (“Rule 49 Order”). In the Rule 49
Order, the Court found that “revealing the material sought to be sealed would jeopardize
an ongoing criminal investigation.” The sealing order was further justified by the Court’s
consideration of “available alternatives that are less drastic than sealing, and finding none
would suffice to protect the government’s legitimate interest in concluding the
investigation; and having found that this legitimate government interest outweighs at this
time any interest in the disclosure of the material.” Rule 49 Order at 1.

H.	Show Cause Hearing

At the Show Cause Hearing on July 16, 2013, Mr. Levison made an oral motion
to unseal the proceedings and related filings. The government objected since unsealing
the proceedings would jeopardize the ongoing criminal investigation o:

Court denied Mr. Levison’s motion. Mr. Levison subsequently indicated to the Court
that he would permit the FBI to place a pen-trap device on his server. The government
requested that the Court further order Mr. Levison to provide his SSL keys since placing

The

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), the Court

9

a pen-trap device on Lavabit’s server would only provide encrypted information that
would not yield the information required under the Pen-Trap Order. The government
noted that Lavabit was also required to provide the SSL keys pursuant to the search
warrant and grand jury subpoena. The Court determined that the government’s request
for the SSL keys was premature given that Mr. Levison had offered to place the pen-trap
device on his server and the Court’s order for a show cause hearing was only based on
the failure to comply with the Pen-Trap Order. Accordingly, the Court scheduled a
hearing for July 26, 2013, to determine whether Lavabit was in compliance with the Pen-
Trap Order after a pen-trap device was installed.

I.	Motion to Unseal and Lift Non-Disclosure Order

On July 25, 2013, Mr. Levison filed two motions—a Motion for Unsealing of
Sealed Court Records (“Motion to Unseal”) and a Motion to Quash Subpoena and Search
Warrant (“Motion to Quash”). In the motions, Mr. Levison confirms that providing the
SSL keys to the government would provide the data required under the Pen-Trap Order in
an unencrypted form. Nevertheless, he refuses to provide the SSL keys. In order to
provide the government with sufficient time to respond, the hearing was rescheduled for
August 1, 2013.

On a later date, and after discussions with Mr. Levison, the FBI installed a pen-
trap device on Lavabit’s Internet service provider, which would capture the same
information as if a pen-trap device was installed on Lavabit’s server. Based on the
government’s ongoing investigation, it is clear that due to Lavabit’s encryption services
the pen-trap device is failing to capture data related to all of the e-mails sent to and from
the account as well as other information required under the Pen-Trap Order. During

10

ARGUMENT

I.	THE SEARCH WARRANT AND THE GRAND JURY SUBPOENA .ARE

LAWUL AND REQUIRE LAV ABIT TO PRODUCE THE SSL KEYS

A.	The search warrant and grand jury subpoena are valid because they

merely re-state Lavabit's pre-existing legal duty, imposed by the Pen-Trap
Order, to produce information necessaiy to accomplish installation of the
pen-trap device.

The motion of Lavabit and Mr. Levison (collectively “Lavabit”) to quash both the
grand jury subpoena and the search warrant should be denied because the subpoena and
warrant merely re-state and clarify Lavabit’s obligation under the Pen-Trap Act to
provide that same information. In total, four separate legal obligations currently compel
Lavabit to produce the SSL keys:

1.	The Pen-Trap Order pursuant to the Pen Register and Trap and Trace
Device Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27);

2.	The Compliance Order compelling compliance forthwith with the Pen-
Trap Order;

3.	The July 16, 2013, grand jury subpoena; and

4.	The July 16, 2013, search warrant, issued by this Court under the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act (“ECPA”).

The Pen-Trap Act authorizes courts to order providers such as Lavabit to disclose
“information” that is “necessary” to accomplish the implementation or use of a pen-trap.
See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3123(b)(2); 3124(a); 3124(b). Judge Buchanan, acting under that
authority, specifically required in the Pen-Trap Order that: “IT IS FURTHER

11

ORDERED, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(2), that Lavabit shall furnish agents from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, forthwith, all information, facilities, and technical
assistance necessary to accomplish the installation and use of the pen/trap device
unobtrusively and with minimum interference.” Pen-Trap Order at 2.

In this case, the SSL keys are ‘information... necessary to accomplish the
installation and use of the [pen-trap]” because all other options for installing the pen-trap
have failed. In a typical case, a provider is capable of implementing a pen-trap by using
its own software or device, or by using a technical solution provided by the investigating
agency; when such a solution is possible, a provider need not disclose its key. E.g., In re
Application of the U.S. for an Order Authorizing the Use of a Pen Register and Trap On
[XXX] Internet Serv. Account/User Name [xxxxxxxx@xxx.com], 396 F. Supp. 2d 45,49
(D. Mass. 2005) (suggesting language in a pen-trap order “to impose upon the internet
service providers the necessity of making sure that they configure their software in such a
manner as to disclose only that which has been authorized”). In this case, given
Lavabit’s use of SSL encryption and Lavabit’s lack of a software solution to implement
the pen-trap on behalf the government, neither the government nor Mr. Levison have
been able to identify such a solution.

Because the search warrant and grand jury subpoena require nothing that the Pen-
Trap Act does not already require, they are not unreasonably burdensome. Moreover, a
court’s constitutional authority to require a telecommunications provider to assist the
government in implementing a pen-trap device is well-established. See United States v.
New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 168-69 (1977) (in a pre-Pen-Trap Act case, holding that
district court had the authority to order a phone company to assist in the installation of a

12

pen-trap, and "no claim is made that it was in any way inconsistent with the Fourth
Amendment.”).

B.	Lavabi! 's motion to quash the search warrant must be denied because

there is no statutory authority for such motions, and the search warrant is
lawful in any event.

1.	Lavabit lacks authority to move to suppress a search
warrant.

Lavabit lacks authority to ask this Court to "quash” a search warrant before it is
executed. The search warrant was issued under Title II of ECPA, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701 -
2712. ECPA allows providers such as Lavabit to move to quash court orders, but does
not create an equivalent procedure to move to quash search warrants. 18 U.S.C.

§ 2703(d). The lack of a corresponding motion to quash or modify a search warrant
means that there is no statutory' authority for such motions. See 18 U.S.C. § 2708 (“[t]he
remedies and sanctions described in this chapter are the only judicial remedies and
sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter.”); cf In re Application of the
U.S.for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), 830 F. Supp. 2d 114, 128-29 (E.D.

Va. 2011) (holding that the lack of a specific provision in ECPA permitting users to move
to quash court orders requires “the Court [to] infer that Congress deliberately declined to
permit [such] challenges.”).

2.	The search warrant complies with the Fourth Amendment
and is not general.

The Fourth Amendment requires that a search warrant “particularly describe[e]
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S. Const. Am. IV.
This “particularity requirement is fulfilled when the warrant identifies the items to be
seized by their relation to designated crimes and when the description of the items leaves

13

nothing to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.” United States v. Williams,
592 F.3d 511, 519 (4th Cir. 2010).

The July 16, 2013, search warrant’s specification easily meets this standard, and
therefore is not impermissibly general. It calls for only:

a. All information necessary to decrypt communications
sent to or from the Lavabit e-mail account

including encryption keys and

SSL keys;

b.	All information necessary to decrypt data stored in or
otherwise associated with the Lavabit account

That specification leaves nothing to discretion; it calls for encryption and SSL keys and
nothing else.

Acknowledging this specificity, Lavabit nonetheless argues that the warrant
“operates as a general warrant by giving the Government access to every Lavabit user’s
communications and data.” Mot. to Quash at 3. To the contrary, the warrant does not
grant the government the legal authority to access any Lavabit user’s communications or
data. After Lavabit produces its keys to the government, Federal statutes, such as the
Wiretap Act and the Pen-Trap Act, will continue to limit sharply the government’s
authority to collect any data on any Lavabit user—except for the one Lavabit user whose
account is currently the subject of the Pen-Trap Order. See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)
(punishing as a felony the unauthorized interception of communications); § 3121
(criminalizing the use of pen-trap devices without a court order). It cannot be that a
search warrant is ‘'general” merely because it gives the government a tool that, if abused
contrary to law, could constitute a general search. Compelling the owner of an apartment
building to unlock the building’s front door so that agents can search one apartment is not

14

a “general search” of the entire apartment building—even if the building owner imagines
that undisciplined agents will illegally kick down the doors to apartments not described in
the warrant.

C.	Lavabir's motion to quash the subpoena must be denied because
compliance would not be unreasonable or oppressive

A grand jury subpoena “may order the witness to produce any books, papers,
documents, data, or other objects the subpoena designates,” but the court “may quash or
modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.” Fed. R. Crim.
P. 17(c)(1) & (2); see In re Grand Jury, John Doe No. G.J.2005-2. 478 F.3d 581, 585
(4th Cir. 2007) (recognizing courts may quash subpoenas that are “abusive or
harassing”).2

Lavabit argues the subpoena should be quashed because it “grant[s] the
Government unlimited access to every one of its user’s accounts.” Mot. to Quash at 7.

As explained above, the subpoena does no such thing: It merely reaffirms Lavabit’s
existing obligation to provide information necessary to implement this Court’s Pen-Trap
Order on a single Lavabit customer’s e-mail account. The Pen-Trap Order further
restricts the government’s access by preventing the government from collecting the
content of that Lavabit customer’s e-mail communications.

Lavabit also argues that it will lose customers’ trust and business if it they learn
that Lavabit provided the SSL keys to the government. But Lavabit finds itself in the
position of having to produce those keys only because, more than a month after the Pen-
Trap Order, Lavabit has failed to assist the government to implement the pen-trap device. 3

3 Lavabit cites 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) as authority for its motion to quash, but that section by its terms only
permits motions to quash court orders issued under that same section.

15

Any resulting loss of customer “trust” is not an “unreasonable” burden if Lavabit’s
customers trusted that Lavabit would refuse to comply with lawful court orders. All
providers are statutorily required to assist the government in the implementation of pen-
traps, see 18 U.S.C. § 3124(a), (b), and requiring providers to comply with that statute is
neither “unreasonable” nor “oppressive.” In any event, Lavabit’s privacy policy tells its
customers that “Lavabit will not release any information related to an individual user
unless legally compelled to do so." See http://lavabit.com/privacv policy.html (emphasis
added).

Finally, once court-ordered surveillance is complete, Lavabit will be free to
change its SSL keys. Vendors sell new SSL certificates for approximately $100. See,

e.g., GoDaddy LLC, SSL Certificates, https://www.godaddv.com/ssl/ssl-certificates.aspx.
Moreover, Lavabit is entitled to compensation “for such reasonable expenses incurred in
providing” assistance in implementing a pen-trap device. 18 U.S.C. § 3124(c).

II.	THE NON-DISCLOSURE ORDER IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST
AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO SERVE
WHAT ALL PARTIES AGREE IS A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT
INTEREST

Lavabit has asked the Court to unseal all of the records sealed by this Court’s
Order to Seal, and to lift the Court’s Order dated July 16, 2013, directing Lavabit not to
disclose the existence of the search warrant the Court signed that day (“Non-Disclosure

Order”). Motion for Unsealing of Sealed Court Records and Removal of Non-
Disclosure Order (“Mot. to Unseal”) at 1-2. Lavabit, however, has not identified (and
cannot) any compelling reason sufficient to overcome what even Lavabit concedes is the
government’s compelling interest in maintaining the secrecy and integrity of its active

investigation!

Moreover, the restrictions are narrowly tailored to restrict

16

Lavabit from discussing only a limited set of information disclosed to them as part of this
investigation. Because there is no reason to jeopardize the criminal investigation, this
motion must be denied.

A.	The Non-Disclosure Order survives even strict scrutiny review by
imposing necessary but limited secrecy obligations on Lavabit

The United States does not concede that strict scrutiny must be applied in
reviewing the Non-Disclosure Order. There is no need to decide this issue, however,
because the Non-Disclosure Order is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling
government interest, and therefore easily satisfies strict scrutiny.

The Government has a compelling interest in protecting the integrity of on-going
criminal investigations. Virginia Dep't of State Police v. Wash. Post, 386 F.3d 567, 579
(4th Cir. 2004) (“We note initially our complete agreement with the general principle that
a compelling governmental interest exists in protecting the integrity of an ongoing law
enforcement investigation”); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 700 (1972)
(“requirements ... that a State’s interest must be ’compelling’ ...are also met here. As we
have indicated, the investigation of crime by the grand jury implements a fundamental
governmental role of securing the safety of the person and property of the citizen ....”).
Indeed, it is “obvious and unarguable that no government interest is more compelling
than the security of the Nation.” Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 307 (1981) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Dep 7 of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988)
(“This Court has recognized the Government’s ‘compelling interest’ in withholding
national security information from unauthorized persons in the course of executive
business”). Likewise, here, the United States clearly has a compelling interest in
ensuring that the target of lawful surveillance is not aware that he is being monitored.

17

United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 606 (1995) (holding that a statute prohibiting
disclosure of a wiretap was permissible under the First Amendment, in part because
“[wje think the Government’s interest is quite sufficient to justify the construction of the
statute as written, without any artificial narrowing because of First Amendment
concerns”). As the Non-Disclosure Order makes clear, publicizing “the existence of the
[search] warrant will seriously jeopardize the investigation, including by giving targets an
opportunity to tlee or continue flight from prosecution, destroy or tamper with evidence,
change patterns of behavior, or notify confederates.”

Lavabit acknowledges that “the government has a compelling interest in

”. Mot. to Unseal

at 4; id. at 6 (“the government has a legitimate interest in tracking”
account); id. at 8 (“the secrecy of [Stored Communications Act] investigations is a
compelling government interest”). In spite of this recognition, Lavabit states it intends to
disclose the search warrant and order should the Court grant the Motion to Unseal. Id. at
5 (“Mr. Levinson needs some ability to voice his concerns [and] gamer support for his
cause”); id. at 6. Disclosure of electronic surveillance process before the electronic
surveillance has finished, would be unprecedented and defeat the very purpose of the

along with the public,
would learn of the monitoring of^|e-mail account and take action to frustrate the
legitimate monitoring of that account.

The Non-Disclosure Order is narrowly tailored to serve the government’s
compelling interest of protecting the integrity of its investigation. The scope of
information that Lavabit may not disclose could hardly be more narrowly drawn: “the

surveillance. Such disclosure would ensure that!

maintaining the integrity of its criminal investigation of

18

existence of the attached search warrant” and the Non-Disclosure Order itself.
Restrictions on a party’s disclosure of information obtained through participation in
confidential proceedings stand on a different and firmer constitutional footing from
restrictions on the disclosure of information obtained by independent means. Seattle
Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 33 (1984) (order prohibiting disclosure of
information learned through judicial proceeding “is not the kind of classic prior restraint
that requires exacting First Amendment scrutiny”); Buttenvortk v. Smith, 494 U.S. 624,
632 (1990) (distinguishing between a witness’ “right to divulge information of which he
was in possession before he testified before the grand jury” with “information which he
may have obtained as a result of his participation in the proceedings of the grand jury”);
see also Hoffman-Pugh v. Keenan, 338 F.3d 1136, 1140 (10th Cir. 2003) (finding
prohibition on disclosing information learned through grand jury process, as opposed to
information person already knew, does not violate First Amendment). In Rhinehart, the
Court found that “control over [disclosure of] the discovered information does not raise
the same specter of government censorship that such control might suggest in other
situations.” 467 U.S. at 32.

Further, the Non-Disclosure Order is temporary. Tire nondisclosure obligation
will last only so long as necessary to protect the government’s ongoing investigation.

B.	The Order neither forecloses discussion of an “entire topic ” nor
constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech

The limitation imposed here does not close off from discussion an “entire topic,”
as articulated in Consolidated Edison. Mot. to Unseal at 4. At issue in that case was the
constitutionality of a state commission’s order prohibiting a regulated utility from
including inserts in monthly bills that discussed any controversial issue of public policy,

such as nuclear power. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of
New York, 447 U.S. 530, 532 (1980). The Non-Disclosure Order, by contrast, precludes
a single individual, Mr. Levison, from discussing a narrow set of information he did not
know before this proceeding commenced, in order to protect the integrity of an ongoing
criminal investigation. Cf. Doe v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 861, 876 (2d Cir. 2009) (“although
the nondisclosure requirement is triggered by the content of a category of information,
that category, consisting of the fact of receipt of [a National Security Letter] and some
related details, is far more limited than the broad categories of information that have been
at issue with respect to typical content-based restrictions.”). Mr. Levison may still
discuss everything he could discuss before the Non-Disclosure Order was issued.

Lavabit’s argument that the Non-Disclosure Order, and by extension all § 2705(b)
orders, are unconstitutional prior restraints is likewise unavailing. Mot. To Unseal at 5-6.
As argued above, the Non-Disclosure Order is narrowly tailored to serve compelling
government interests, and satisfies strict scrutiny. See supra, Part II.A. Regardless, the
Non-Disclosure Order does not fit within the two general categories of prior restraint that
can run afoul of the First Amendment: licensing regimes in which an individual’s right to
speak is conditioned upon prior approval from the government, see City of Lakewood v.
Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988), and injunctions restraining
certain speech and related activities, such as publishing defamatory or scandalous
articles, showing obscene movies, and distributing leaflets, see Alexander v. United
States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993). A prior restraint denies a person the ability to express
viewpoints or ideas they could have possessed without any government involvement.
Section 2705(b) orders, by contrast, restrict a recipient’s ability to disclose limited

20

information that the recipient only learned from the government’s need to effectuate a
legitimate, judicially sanctioned form of monitoring. Such a narrow limitation on
information acquired only by virtue of an official investigation does not raise the same
concerns as other injunctions on speech. Cf. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. at 32, Doe v. Mukasey,
549 F.3d at 877 (“[t]he non-disclosure requirement” imposed by the national security
letter statute “is not a typical prior restraint or a typical content-based restriction
warranting the most rigorous First .Amendment scrutiny”).

III.	NO VALID BASIS EXISTS TO UNSEAL DOCUMENTS THAT, IF MADE
PUBLIC PRE-MATURELY, WOULD JEOPARDIZE AN ON-GOING
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

A. Any common law right of access is outweighed by the need to protect the
integrity of the investigation.

Lavabit asserts that the common law right of access necessitates reversing this
Court’s decision to seal the search warrant and supporting documents. Mot. to Unseal at
7-10. The presumption of public access to judicial records, however, is “qualified,” Balt.
Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 65 (4th Cir. 1989), and rebuttable upon a showing that the
“public’s right of access is outweighed by competing interests.” In re Application of the
U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), 707 F.3d 283, 290 (4th Cir.
2013) (“Twitter ’). In addition to considering substantive interests, a judge must also
consider procedural alternatives to sealing judicial records. Twitter, 707 F.3d at 294.
“Adherence to this procedure serves to ensure that the decision to seal materials will not
be made lightly and that it will be subject to meaningful appellate review.” Va. Dep't of
State Police v. Wash. Post, 386 F.3d 567, 576 (4th Cir. 2004). This standard is met easily
here.

21

”[T]he common law does not afford as much substantive protection to the
interests of the press and the public as does the First Amendment.” Twitter, 707 F.3d at
290 (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to the substantive equities at stake,
the United States’ interest in maintaining the secrecy of a criminal investigation to
prevent the target of the surveillance from being alerted and altering behavior to thwart
the surveillance clearly outweighs any public interest in learning about specific acts of
surveillance. Id. at 294 (rejecting common law right of access because, inter alia, the
sealed documents “set forth sensitive non-public facts, including the identity of targets
and witnesses in an ongoing criminal investigation”). “Because secrecy is necessary for
the proper functioning of the criminal investigation” prior to indictment, “openness will
frustrate the government’s operations.” Id. at 292. Lavabit concedes that ensuring “the
secrecy of [Stored Communications Act] investigations,” like this, “is a compelling
government interest." Mot. to Unseal at 8 (emphasis added). Lavabit does not, however,
identify any compelling interests to the contrary. Far from presenting “a seriously
concerning expansion of grand jury subpoena power,” as Lavabit’s contents, id., a judge
issued the Pen-Trap Order, which did not authorize monitoring of any Lavabit e-mail
account other than

In addition, the Court satisfied the procedural prong. It “considered the available
alternatives that are less drastic than sealing, and [found] none -would suffice to protect
the government’s legitimate interest in concluding the investigation.” Rule 49 Order.

The Fourth Circuit’s decision in Twitter is instructive. That case arose from the
Wikileaks investigation of Army Pfc. Bradley Manning. Specifically, the government
obtained an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) directing Twitter to disclose electronic

22

communications and account and usage information pertaining to three subscribers.

When apprised of this, the subscribers asserted that a common law right of access
required unsealing records related to the § 2703(d) order. The Fourth Circuit rejected this
claim, finding that the public’s interest in the Wikileaks investigation and the
government’s electronic surveillance of internet activities did not outweigh “the
Government’s interests in maintaining the secrecy of its investigation, preventing
potential suspects from being tipped off, or altering behavior to thwart the Government’s
ongoing investigation.” 707 F.3d at 293. “The mere fact that a case is high profile in
nature,” the Fourth Circuit observed, “does not necessarily justify public access.” Id. at
294. Though Twitter involved a § 2703(d) order, rather than a § 2705(b) order, the Court
indicated this is a distinction without a difference. Id. at 294 (acknowledging that the
concerns about unsealing records “accord” with § 2705(b)). Given the similarities
between Twitter and the instant case—most notably the compelling need to protect
otherwise confidential information from public disclosure and the national attention to
the matter—there is no compelling rationale currently before the Court necessitating
finding that a common law right of access exists here.

B. Courts have inherent authority to seal ECPA process

Lavabit asserts that this Court must unseal the Non-Disclosure Order because 18
U.S.C. § 2705(b) does not explicitly reference the sealing of non-disclosure orders issued
pursuant to that section. Mot. to Unseal at 9-10. As an initial matter, the Court has
inherent authority to seal documents before it. In re Knight Tub. Co., 743 F.2d 231,235
(4th Cir. 1984) (“[t]he trial court has supervisory power over its own records and may, in
its discretion, seal documents if the public’s right of access is outweighed by competing

23

interests’'); see also Media General Operations, Inc. v. Buchanan, 417 F3d. 424, 430 (4th
Cir. 2005); United States v. US. Dist. Court, 407 U.S. 297, 321 (1972) (“a warrant
application involves no public or adversary proceedings: it is an ex parte request before a
magistrate or judge.”). In addition, the Court here exercised its authority to seal pursuant
to Local Rule 49(B), the validity of which Lavabit does not contest.

Even if the Court did not have this authority, Lavabit’s reading of § 2705(b) must
be rejected, because it would gut the essential function of non-disclosure orders and
thereby disregard Congress’ clear intent in passing § 2705. The Section allow's courts to
delay notification pursuant to § 2705(a) or issue a non-disclosure order pursuant to
§ 2705(b) upon finding that disclosure would risk enumerated harms, namely danger to a
person’s life or safety, flight from prosecution, destruction of evidence, intimidation of
witnesses, or seriously jeopardizing an investigation. 18 U.S.C. §§ 2705(a)(2)(A)-(E),
(b)(l)-(5). It would make no sense for Congress to purposefully authorize courts to limit
disclosure of sensitive information while simultaneously intending to allow the same
information to be publicly accessible in an unsealed court document.

Finally, the implications Lavabit attempts to draw from the mandatory sealing
requirements of 1 8 U.S.C. §§ 2518(8)(b) and 3123(a)(3)(B) are mistaken. While Lavabit
characterizes those statutes as granting courts the authority to seal Wiretap Act and pen-
trap orders, courts already had that authority. Those statutes have another effect: they
removed discretion from courts by requiring that courts seal Wiretap Act orders and pen-
trap orders. See 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(b) (“Applications made and orders granted under
this chapter shall be sealed by the judge”) (emphasis added); id. § 3123(a)(3)(B) (“The
record maintained under subparagraph (A) shall be provided ex parte and under seal to

24

the court”) (emphasis added). Congress” decision to leave that discretion in place in
other situations does not mean that Congress believed that only Wiretap Act and pen-trap
orders may be sealed.

C.	Supposed privacy concerns do not compel a common law right of access

to the sealed documents.

Lavabit’s brief ends with an argument that privacy interests require a common
law right of access. Mot. to Unseal at 10-11. Lavabit, however, offers no legal basis for
this Court to adopt such a novel argument, nor do the putative policy considerations
Lavabit references outweigh the government’s compelling interest in preserving the
secrecy of its ongoing criminal investigation. Indeed, the most compelling interest
currently before the Court is ensuring that the Court’s orders requiring that Mr. Levison
and Lavabit comply with legitimate monitoring be implemented forthwith and without
additional delay, evasion, or resistance by Mr. Levison and Lavabit.

25

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Lavabit’s motions should be denied. Furthermore, the
Court should enforce the Pen-Trap Order, Compliance Order, search warrant, and grand
jury subpoena by imposing sanctions until Lavabit complies.

PROCEEDINGS

THE CLERK:	In re:	Case Nos. 1:13 EC 297, 1:13 SW 522,

and Grand Jury No. 13-1.

MR. TRUMP:	Good morning. Jim Trump on behalf of the

United States.

THE COURT:	Good morning.

MR. BINNALL:	Good morning, Your Honor. Jesse Binnall

on behalf of Lavabit and Mr. Levison.

THE COURT:	All right.

MR. BINNALL:	May it please the Court. We're before

the Court today on two separate motions, a motion to quash the
requirement of Lavabit to produce its encryption keys and the
motion to unseal and lift the nondisclosure requirements of
Mr. Levison. .

Your Honor, the motion to quash in this arises because
the privacy of users is at — of Lavabit's users are at stake.
We're not simply speaking of the target of this investigation.
We’re talking about over 400,000 individuals and entities that
are users of Lavabit who use this service because they believe
their communications are secure.

By handing over the keys, the encryption keys in this
case, they necessarily become less secure. In this case it is
true that the face of the warrant itself does limit the
documents or — and communications to be viewed and the specific
metadata to be viewed to the target of the case,

However, there is a lack of any sort of check or
balance in order to ensure that the — that the encrypted data
of other Lavabit users remain secure. The encryption in this
case doesn't protect only content. It protects login data and
the other — some of the other metadata involved in this case.

We believe that this is not the least restrictive means
in order to provide the government the data that they are
looking for. Specifically —

THE COURT:	You have two different encryption codes,

one for the logins and the messages that are transmitted. You
have another code that encrypts the content of the messages,
right?

MR. BINNALL:	Your Honor, I believe that that is true.

From my understanding of the way that this works is
that there is one SSL key. That SSL key is what is issue in
this case, and that SSL key specifically protects the
communication, the over — the breadth of the communication
itself from the user's actual computer to the server to make
sure that the user is communicating with exactly who the user
intends to be communicating with, the server.

And that's one of the things that SSL does. It ensures
that you're talking to the right person via e-mail and there's
not a so-called man in the middle who's there to take that
message away.

THE COURT:	Does that key also contain the code of the

message and interpret the message as well?

MR. BINNALL:	My understanding is that it does, Your

Honor, but because that's not my technical expertise, I'm not
going to represent to the Court anything on that one way or
another. But my understanding is there is one general key here
that is at issue.

THE COURT:	Well, why would you set up such? I mean, a

telephone, you've got telephone numbers and —

MR. BINNALL:	Correct.

THE COURT:	-- those can be traced very easily without

any look at the content of the message that's there. You-all
could have set up something the same way.

MR. BINNALL:	We could have, Your Honor. Actually, if

you're to —

THE COURT:	So if anybody’s — you're blaming the

government for something that's overbroad, but it seems to me
that your client is the one that set up the system that's
designed not to protect that information, because you know that
there needs to be access to calls that go back and forth to one
person or another. And to say you can't do that just because
you’ve set up a system that everybody has to — has to be
unencrypted, if there's such a word, that doesn't seem to me to
be a very persuasive argument.

MR. BINNALL:	I understand the Court's point, and this

is the way that I understand why it's done that way.

There s different security aspects involved for people
v;ho want -o protect their privacy, and there certainly is the
actual content of the message themselves. That's certainly what
I would concede is the highest security interest.

But there's also the security interest to make sure
that they re communicating with who you want to be communicating
with. That is equally of a concern for privacy issues because
that is, at the end of the day, one of the things that secures
the content of the message.

In this case it is true that most Internet service
providers do log, is what they call it, a lot of the metadata
that the government wants in this case without that necessarily
being encrypted, things such as who something is going to, who
it's going from, the time it's being sent, the IP address from
which it is being sent.

Lavabit code is not something that you buy off the
shelf. It is code that was custom made. It was custom made in
order to secure privacy to the largest extent possible and to be
the most secure way possible for multiple people to communicate,
and so it has chosen specifically not to log that information.

Now, that is actually information that my client has
offered to start logging with the particular user in this case.
It is, however, something that is quite burdensome on him. It
is something that would be custom code that would take between
20 to 40 hours for him to be able to produce. We believe that

is a better alternative than turning over the encryption key
which can be used to get the data for all Lavabit users.

I hope that addresses the Court's concern kind of with
regard to the metadata and why it is not more -- why Lavabit
hasn't created an encryption system that may honestly be more
within the mainstream, but this is a provider that specifically
was started in order to have to protect privacy interests more
than the average Internet service provider.

THE COURT:	I can understand why the system was set up,

but I think the government is -- government's clearly entitled
to the information that they're seeking, and just because
you-all have set up a system that makes that difficult, that
doesn't in any way lessen the government’s right to receive that
information just as they would from any telephone company or any
other e-mail source that could provide it easily. Whether
it's — in other words, the difficulty or the ease in obtaining
the information doesn't have anything to do with whether or not
the government's lawfully entitled to the information.

MR. BINNALL:	It is — and we don't disagree that the

government is entitled to the information. We actually —

THE COURT:	Well, how are we going to get it? I'm

going to have to deny your motion to quash. It's just not
overbroad. The government's asking for a very narrow, specific
bit of information, and it's information that they're entitled
to.

Now, how are we going to work out that they get it?

MR. BINNALL:	Your Honor, what I would still say is the

best method for them to get it is, first of all, there be some
way for there to be some sort of accountability other than just
relying on the government to say we’re not going to go outside
the scope of the warrant.

This is nothing that is, of course, personal against
the government and the, you know, very professional law
enforcement officers involved in this case. But quite simply,
the way the Constitution is set up, it's set up in a way to
ensure that there's some sort of checks and balances and
accountability.

THE COURT:	What checks and balances need to be set up?

MR. BINNALL:	Well —

THE COURT:	Suggest something to me.

MR. BINNALL:	I think that the least restrictive means

possible here is that the government essentially pay the
reasonable expenses, meaning in this case my client’s extensive
labor costs to be capped at a reasonable amount.

THE COURT:	Has the government ever done that in one of

these pen register cases?

MR. BINNALL:	Not that I've found, Your Honor.

THE COURT:	I don't think so. I've never known of one.

MR. BINNALL:	And Your Honor's certainly seen more of

these than I have.

THE COURT:	So would it be reasonable to start now with

your client?

MR. BINNALL:	I think everyone would agree that this is

an unusual case. And that this case, in order to protect the
privacy of 400,000-plus other users, some sort of relatively
small manner in which to create a log system for this one user
to give the government the metadata that they're looking for is
the least restrictive mean here, and we can do that in a way
that doesn't compromise the security keys.

This is actually a way that my client --
THE COURT:	You want to do it in a way that the

government has to trust you —

MR. BINNALL:	Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:	— to come up with the right data.

MR. BINNALL:	That's correct, Your Honor.

THE COURT:	And you won't trust the government. So why

would the government trust you?

MR. BINNALL:	Your Honor, because that's what the basis

of Fourth Amendment law says is more acceptable, is that the
government is the entity that you really need the checks and
balances on.

Now, my --

THE COURT:	I don't know that the Fourth Amendment says

that. This is a criminal investigation.

MR. BINNALL:	That is absolutely correct.

THE COURT:	A criminal investigation, and I don't know

that the Fourth Amendment says that the person being
investigated here is entitled to more leeway and more rights
than the government is. I don't know.

MR. BINNALL:	There certainly is a balance of power

there. I, of course, am not here to represent the interest of
I'm here specifically looking over my client who
has sensitive data —

THE COURT:	I understand. I'm trying to think of

working out something. I'm not sure you're suggesting anything
to me other than either you do it and the government has to
trust you to give them whatever you want to give them or you
have to trust the government that they're not going to go into
your other files.

Is there some other route?

MR. BINNALL:	I would suggest that the government —

I'm sorry — that the Court can craft an order to say that we
can — that we should work in concert with each other in order
to come up with this coding system that gives the government all
of the metadata that we can give them through this logging
procedure that we can install in the code, and then using that
as a least restrictive means to see if that can get the
government the information that they're looking for on the
specific account.

THE COURT:	How long does it take to install that?

MR. BINNALL: I mean, 20, 40 hours. So I would suggest
that would probably be a week to a week and a half, Your Honor,
although I would be willing to talk to my client to see if we
can get that expedited.

THE COURT:	To install it?

MR. BINNALL:	Well, to write the code.

THE COURT:	You don't have a code right at the moment.

You would have to write something?

MR. BINNALL:	That’s correct. And the portion of the

government's brief that talks about the money that he was
looking for is that reasonable expense for him basically to do
nothing for that period of time but write code to install in

order to take the data from

land put it in a way that

the government will see the logged metadata involved.

THE COURT:	All right. I think I understand your

position. I don't think you need to argue this motion to
unseal. This is a grand jury matter and part of an ongoing
criminal investigation, and any motion to unseal will be denied.

MR. 3INNALL:	If I could have the Court's attention

just on one issue of the nondisclosure provision of this. And I
understand the Court's position on this, but there is other
privileged communications if the Court would be so generous as
to allow me very briefly to address that issue?

There's other First Amendment considerations at issue
with not necessarily just the sealing of this, but what

Mr. Levison can disclose and to whom he may disclose it.

The First Amendment, of course, doesn't just cover
speech and assembly, but the right to petition for a redress of
grievances. We’re talking about a statute here, and, honestly,
a statute that is very much in the public eye and involving
issues that are currently pending before Congress.

I think the way that the order currently is written,
besides being —

THE COURT:	You're talking about the sealing order?

MR. BINNALL:	I'm talking about the sealing order and

the order that prohibits Mr. Levison from disclosing any
information.

Now, we don't v/ant to disclose — we have no intention
of disclosing the target, but we would like to be able to, for
instance, talk to members of the legislature and their staffs
about rewriting this in a way that's —

THE COURT:	No. This is an ongoing criminal

investigation, and there's no leeway to disclose any information
about it.

MR. BINNALL:	And so at that point it will remain with

only Mr. Levison and his lawyers, and we'll keep it at that.

THE COURT:	Let me hear from Mr. Trump.

Is there some way we can work this out or something
that I can do with an order that will help this or what?

MR. TRUMP:	I don't believe so, Your Honor, because

you’ve already articulated the reason why is that anything done
by Mr. Levison in terms of writing code or whatever, we have to
trust Mr. Levison that we have gotten the information that we
entitled to get since June 28th. He's had every
opportunity to propose solutions to come up with ways to address
his concerns and he simply hasn't.

We can assure the Court that the way that this would
operate, while the metadata stream would be captured by a
device, the device does not download, does not store, no one
looks at it. It filters everything, and at the back end of the
filter, we get what we're required to get under the order.

So there's no agents looking through the 400,000 other
bits of information, customers, whatever. No one looks at that,
no one stores it, no one has access to it. All we're going to
look at and all we're going to keep is what is called for under
the pen register order, and that's all we’re asking this Court
to do.

THE COURT:	All right. Well, I think that's

reasonable. So what is this before me for this morning other
than this motion to quash and unseal which I've ruled on?

MR. TRUMP:	The only thing is to order the production

of the encryption keys, which just —

THE COURT:	Hasn't that already been done? There's a

subpoena for that.

MR. TRUMP:	There's a search warrant for it, the motion

to quash.

THE COURT:	Search warrant.

MR. TRUMP:	Excuse me?

THE COURT:	I said subpoena, but I meant search

warrant.

MR. TRUMP:	We issued both, Your Honor, but Your Honor

authorized the seizure of that information. And we would ask
the Court to enforce that by directing Mr. Levison to turn over
the encryption keys.

If counsel represents that that will occur, we can not
waste any more of the Court's time. If he represents that
Mr. Levison will not turn over the encryption keys, then we have
to discuss what remedial action this Court can take to require
compliance with that order.

THE COURT:	Well, I will order the production of

those — of those keys.

Is that simply Mr. Levison or is that the corporation

as well?

MR. TRUMP:	That's one and the same, Your Honor.

Just so the record is clear. We understand from
Mr. Levison that the encryption keys were purchased
commercially. They're not somehow custom crafted by
Mr. Levison. He buys them from a vendor and then they're
installed.

THE COURT:	Well, I will order that. If you will

present an order to me, I'll enter it later on.

MR. TRUMP:	Thank you.

MR. BINNALL:	Thank you, Your Honor.

As far as time frame goes, my client did ask me if the
Court did order this if the Court could give him approximately
five days in order to actually physically get the encryption
keys here. And so it will be — or just some sort of reasonable
time frame to get the encryption keys here and in the
government's hands. He did ask me to ask exactly the manner
that those are to be turned over.

MR. TRUMP:	Your Honor, we understand that this can be

done almost instantaneously, as soon as Mr. Levison makes
contact with an agent in Dallas, and we would ask that he be
given 24 hours or less to comply. This has been going on for a
month.

THE COURT: Yeah, I don't think 24 — 24 hours would be
reasonable. Doesn't have to do it in the next few minutes, but
I would think something like this, it's not anything he has to
amass or get together. It's just a matter of sending something.

So I think 24 hours would be reasonable.

MR. BINNALL:	Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:	All right. And you'll present me an order?

MR. TRUMP:	We will, Your Honor. Thank you.

THE COURT:	All right. Thank you-all, and we’ll

CLERK. Ü.S. DISTRICT COURT
ALEXANDRIA. VIRGINIA

MOTION FOR SANCTIONS

The United States, through the undersigned counsel, pursuant to Title 18, United States
Code, Section 401, hereby moves for the issuance of an order imposing sanctions on Lavabit
LLC and Ladar Levison, its owner and operator, for Lavabit’s failure to comply with this Court’s
order entered August 1, 2013. In support of this motion, the United States represents:

1.	At the hearing on August 1,2013, this Court directed Lavabit to provide the
government with the encryption keys necessary for the operation of a pen register/trap and trace
order entered June 28, 2013. Lavabit was ordered to provide those keys by 5 p.m. on August 2,
2013. See Order Denying Motions entered August 2, 2013.

2.	At approximately 1:30 p.m. CDT on August 2, 2013, Mr. Levison gave the FBI a
printout of what he represented to be the encryption keys needed to operate the pen register. This

printout, in what appears to be 4-point type, consists of 11 pages of largely illegible characters.
See Attachment A. (The attachment was created by scanning the document provided by Mr.
Levison; the original document was described by the Dallas FBI agents as slightly clearer than
the scanned copy but nevertheless illegible.) Moreover, each of the five encryption keys contains
512 individual characters - or a total of 2560 characters. To make use of these keys, the FBI
would have to manually input all 2560 characters, and one incorrect keystroke in this laborious
process would render the FBI collection system incapable of collecting decrypted data.

3.	At approximately 3:30 p.m. EDT (2:30 p.m. CDT), the undersigned AUSA
contacted counsel for Lavabit LLC and Mr. Levison and informed him that the hard copy format
for receipt of the encryption keys was unworkable and that the government would need the keys
produced in electronic format. Counsel responded by email at 6:50 p.m. EDT stating that Mr.
Levison “thinks” he can have an electronic version of the keys produced by Monday, August 5,
2013.

4.	On August 4, 2013, the undersigned AUSA sent an e-mail to counsel for Lavabit
LLC and Mr. Levison stating that we expect to receive an electronic version of the encryption
keys by 10:00 a.m. CDT on Monday, August 5, 2013. The e-mail indicated that we expect the
keys to be produced in PEM format, an industry standard file format for digitally representing
SSL keys. See Attachment B. The e-mail further stated that the preferred medium for receipt of
these keys w'ould be a CD hand-delivered to the Dallas office of the FBI (with which Mr.
Levison is familiar). The undersigned AUSA informed counsel for Lavabit LLC and Mr.
Levison that the government would seek an order imposing sanctions if we did not receive the
encryption keys in electronic format by Monday morning.

-2-

5.	The government did not receive the electronic keys as requested. The
undersigned AUSA spoke with counsel for Lavabit and Mr. Levison at approximately 10:00 a.m.
this morning, and he stated that Mr. Levison might be able to produce the keys in electronic
format by 5 p.m. on August 5, 2013. The undersigned AUSA told counsel that was not
acceptable given that it should take Mr. Levison 5 to 10 minutes to put the keys onto a CD in
PEM format. The undersigned AUSA told counsel that if there was some reason why it cannot
be accomplished sooner, to let him know by 11:00 a.m. this morning. The government has not
received an answer from counsel.

6.	The government therefore moves the Court to impose sanctions on Lavabit LLC
and Mr. Levison in the amount of $5000 per day beginning at noon (EDT) on August 5,2013,
and continuing each day in the same amount until Lavabit LLC and Mr. Levison comply with
this Court’s orders.

7.	As noted, Attachment A to this motion is a copy of the printout provided by Mr.
Levison on August 2, 2013. Attachment B is a more detailed explanation of how these
encryption keys can be given to the FBI in an electronic format. Attachment C to this motion is a
proposed order.

-3-

8.	A copy of this motion, filed under seal, was delivered by email to counsel for
Lavabit LLC on August 5, 2013.

ATTACHMENT B

Lavabil uses 2048-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates purchased from GoDaddy to
encrypt communication between users and its server. SSL encryption employs public-key
cryptography, in which both the sender and receiver each have two mathematically linked keys: a
“public” key and a “private” key. “Public” keys are published, but “private” keys are not. In this
circumstance, a Lavabit customer uses Lavabit’s published public key to initiate an encrypted
email session with Lavabit over the internet. Lavabit’s servers then decrypt this traffic using their
private key. The only way to decrypt this traffic is through the usage of this private key. A SSL
certificate is another name for a published public key.

To obtain a SSL certificate from GoDaddy, a user needs to first generate a 2048-bit
private key on his/her computer. Depending on the operating system and web server used, there
are multiple ways to generate a private key. One of the more popular methods is to use a freely
available command-line tool called OpenSSL. This generation also creates a certificate signing
request file. The user sends this file to the SSL generation authority (e.g. GoDaddy) and
GoDaddy then sends back the SSL certificate. The private key is not sent to GoDaddy and
should be retained by the user. This private key is stored on the user’s web server to permit
decryption of internet traffic, as described above. The FBI’s collection system that will be
installed to implement the PR/TT also requires the private key to be stored to decrypt Lavabit
email and internet traffic. This decrypted traffic will then be filtered for the target email address
specified in the PR/TT order.

Depending on how exactly the private key was first generated by the user, it itself may be
encrypted and protected by a password supplied by the user. This additional level of security is
useful if, for example, a backup copy of the private key is stored on a CD. If that CD was lost or
stolen, the private key would not be compromised because a password would be required to
access it. However, the user that generated the private key would have supplied it at generation
time and would thus have knowledge of it. The OpenSSL tool described above is capable of
decrypting encrypted private keys and converting the keys to a non-encrypted format with a
simple, well-documented command. The FBI’s collection system and most web servers requires
the key to be stored in a non-encrypted format.

A 2048-bit key is composed of 512 characters. The standard practice of exchanging
private SSL keys between entities is to use some electronic medium (e.g., CD or secure internet
exchange). SSL keys are rarely, if ever, exchanged verbally or through print medium due to their
long length and possibility of human error. Mr. Levison has previously stated that Lavabit
actually uses five separate public/private key pairs, one for each type of mail protocol used by
Lavabit.

PEM format is an industry-standard file format for digitally representing SSL keys. PEM
files can easily be created using the OpenSSL tool described above. The preferred medium for
receiving these keys would be on a CD.
