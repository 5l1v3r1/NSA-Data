Phase 1: Intelligent Router Configuration File Parsing

•	Routers have numerous services running on them that help

identify the NOC IP ranges:

-	SSH

-	TELNET/VTY

-	SNMP

-	SYSLOG

-	DNS

-	TACACS

-	RADIUS

•	Access to these services tends to be locked down by the use of
Access Control Lists (ACLs)

•	Configuration files provide details of how services are
configured.

GCHQ / CSEC NAC Joint tradecraft development

•	During March 2011 GCHQ Analysts visited CSEC to look at the
using PENTAHO for tradecraft modelling working with CSEC
NAC and CSEC/H3 software developers to see if could model
NOCTURNAL SURGE in PENTAHO and then implement in

OLYMPIA.

•	Only possible to attempt because:

-	GCHQ NAC use PENTAHO

-	CSEC NAC/H3 use PENTAHO

-	CSEC NAC have implemented GCHQ NAC TIDAL SURGE Database
Schema (DSD also have this..)

•	GCHQ approach based on AS

•	CSEC approach based on Country

Phase 2: Intelligent use of Metadata

•	We do not always get full configuration files to parse.

•	Services between routers and NOCs run on IP/TCP/UDP

•	We do create 5-TUPLE metadata from our collection

-	GCHQ have prototype database - 5-Alive

-	CSEC have database - HYPERION

Phase 3: Intelligent use of TELNET traffic

•	Again we do not always get full configuration files. Phase 1 is
based on full (or as near to full) configuration files

•	GCHQ NAC collect TELNET Sessions into TERMINAL SURGE

-	Collection based on TCP Port 23 (TELNET)

-	Other protocols use TCP Port 23 (YMSG)

•	Interaction with Routers over TCP Port 23 maybe nefarious:

-	Scanning

-	Password guessing

•	Need to separate legitimate use from nefarious activity

•	Look for signs of legitimate use.

-	Successful login

-	Follow on commands

Intelligent analysis of TELNET traffic

The fact that login was successful for both examples means the

following:

- From TCP Port 23

•	To IP address is Network Management Terminal (in the

NOC ?)

To TCP Port 23

•	From IP address is Network Management Terminal (in

Phase 4: Bulk Port Scanning

We know the key services/servers running in the NOC

• Utilise HACIENDA, GCHQ’s bulk port scanning capability to
identify what IPs have these service ports open - additional
logic to build up confidence required.

Fusion of sources

Aim is to bring all sources that help identify NOC IP ranges
together with associated confidence.

Different techniques provide different results due to the nature of
passive access (international v’s in-country for instance)

Different techniques have different levels of reliability - therefore
looking to develop aggregation with overlay of smart

intelligence.

Solution can work on not just ISP
NOCs but also Mobile OMCs.

And then....enabling CNE on NOCs

•	We now have IP ranges - need selectors of NOC Staff to
enable QUANTUM INSERT attack against them.

•	Use of GCHQ TDI capability to identify selectors coming out of
IP ranges and/or identification of proxy/NAT within NOC range.
