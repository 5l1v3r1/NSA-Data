(TS//S1//NF) As close as the ISNU relationship has become, it has not been without
tension. The Jonathan Pollard incident is one example that had a negative, albeit
temporary, impact to the S1G1NT relationship. Balancing the S1G1NT exchange equally
between US and Israeli needs has been a constant challenge. In the last decade, it
arguably tilted heavily in favor of Israeli security concerns. 9/11 came, and went, with
NSA’s only true Third Party CT relationship being driven almost totally by the needs of
the partner. Nevertheless, the survival of the state of Israel is a paramount goal of US
Middle Hast policy. There is no doubt that the NSA-ISNU SIGINT relationship is built
upon a solid foundation of trust and common purpose.
