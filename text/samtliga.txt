(S//REL to USA, FVEY) Subject: NSA Intelligence Relationship with Sweden
(U) Introduction

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA’s relationship with the Swedish SIGINT service,
Forsvarets Radioanstalt (FRA), was established in 1954 under the UKUSA agreement.
At that time it was agreed that GCHQ would take the lead for the exchange of COMINT
information and that NSA would take the lead for the ELINT exchange. As of April
2004, NSA, GCHQ and the FRA agreed to dissolve this part of the UKUSA agreement
and hold bilateral exchanges on both COMINT and ELINT.

(TS//SI//NF) NSA’s relationship with the FRA, an extremely competent, technically
innovative, and trusted Third Party partner, continues to grow. The FRA provided NSA
with access to its cable collection in 2011, providing unique collection on high-priority
Russian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy

. FRA’s efforts against counter-terrorism (CT) targets continue to expand, and
new legislation enacted in January 2013 has improved its ability to work directly with the
Swedish internal security service (SAPO). NSA’s Data Acquisition is actively engaged
with the FRA, which has numerous collection sites and is proficient in collecting a wide
variety of communications.

(U) Key Issues

(TS//SI//NF) The FRA continues to place more emphasis on cyber. NSA’s National
Threat Operations Center (NTOC) and FRA analysts have an ongoing exchange
discussing malware topics. The FRA is positioning itself to become the cyber defense
authority in Sweden and hopes to receive the Swedish government mandate in the near
future.

Sweden

(TS 'SI) Based on a 1954 agreement between NSA and GCHQ (later ratified in the 1956UKUSA accords), GCHQ had the lead with Sweden for COMINT matters. NSA had the lead for ELINT and, as things
evolved, technical SIGINT issues for both COMINT and ELINT. In 2004 we mutually agreed that our 50-year-old arrangement was no longer operable since we,

(T&'/SI) Therefore, we drafted a paper that was signed by NSA’s Principal Director for Foreign Affairs, GCHQ’s head of Foreign Relations, and the Director General of Sweden's SIGINT Service (FRA), allowing NSA
to deal with the FRA on COMINT issues without pre-coordination with GCHQ. The paper also requires both of us to keep the other informed as to what we are doing with the FRA, and requires the FRA to dedupe if
both GCHQ and we are separately' asking for the same or similar exchanges. As a result of this change, our COMINT relationship with die FRA has burgeoned on both sides. The relationship with Sweden is protected at
the TOP SECRET level because of that nation's political neutrality.
