Analytic use of data

Security

•	Data access controlled across 2
dimensions:

•	Usability: Operational (standard
events) or Controlled (special
purpose e.g. test)

•	Classification: Multiple buckets -
Open (TSS2), a few compartments,
general CIOs Sensitive

•	Capability developer access
restricted by file/directory
permissions

•	User facing applications apply fine
grained security on per record basis

Silver Library

•	Abstraction layer to separate analytic
development from storage
dependencies

•	Pluggable parsers for new formats

•	Record parsers for event data held in
HDFS

•	Applications still need to know field
labels (function calls)

•	Applications often add additional
abstractions

•	Input and Output handlers to read
and write data based on type

•	Utility functions to aid development

•	Simple search and filter routines

•	Events Product Centre maintained
