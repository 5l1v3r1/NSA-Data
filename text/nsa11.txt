FAD Success Stories Sample

Each FAD success story should have the 4 sections: Title, Problem, Solution, and Impact.

See below for sample.

(U) Title:	(TS 'SI//NF)Capability Provided to Dutch Assists in

Capture of Somali Pirates and Mapping of Piracy-Related Network

(U) Problem: (TS//SI//NF) NSA access to Somali pirate communications has dropped, partly

ships from the EU anti-piracy operation ATALANTA, boxed in the hijacked
vessel and launched the special operation. In early August, MIVD had alerted the
Rotterdam about a piracy-related	and then continued to provide

updates on the hijacked vessel’s course and the pirates' intentions. Meanwhile,
tht Rotterdam was able to intercept	communications |
