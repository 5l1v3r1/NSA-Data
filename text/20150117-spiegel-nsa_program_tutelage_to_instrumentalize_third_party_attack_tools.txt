of an adversary’s activities traversing the lAPs to provide a

Upgrades & What They Mean

Upgrade to 10G Sensor provides additional capabilities and
enables future upgrades:

•Immediate Benefits:

-	Increased speed and capacity

-	TS//SI signatures

-	Full Snort (Current sensors use packet-based Snort. 10G sensors
use session-based Snort.)

-	Multi-event Snort
•Future Upgrades:

-	POPQUIZ: Real-time behavioral analytics

-	GNOMEVISION: De-obfuscation of malicious packages

-	Cryptanalytic Capabilities

-	Netflow: Traffic analysis with GHOSTMACHINE

U.S. Military Leaders Defended

•Based on information from SIGINT
collection, a TUTELAGE
countermeasure was developed and
deployed in 2009 for a particular
BYZANTINE HADES attack.

•On October 21st and 22nd 2010, the
spear-phishing attack was
launched. The attack targeted four
users, including the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of
Naval Operations, with a carefully
disguised malicious PDF.

• NTOC operated the countermeasure
and the attack was thwarted.
