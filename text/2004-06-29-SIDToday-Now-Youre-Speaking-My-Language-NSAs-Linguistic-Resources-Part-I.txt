The ability to understand a target's language is more<br>crucial than it has ever been, and this shortcoming must be<br>rectified. In this special mini-series, we'll look at the nature of the<br>problem and describe some of the NSA/CSS initiatives to fix it.<br>(C) First, what kinds of cryptologic language skills does the SIGINT<br>System need? The NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority (SLA),<br>together with target offices and experts, documents all cryptologic<br>language missions worldwide (2300+), along with the language<br>skill level required to prosecute those missions. Currently 85% of<br>the NSA/CSS cryptologic missions require a skill level of 3<br>or better , meaning that the cryptologic language analyst must be<br>able to read and listen "between the lines" to unformatted,<br>unpredictable discourse that includes analysis, commentary,<br>opinion, arguments, diplomatic exchanges, and extended<br>outbursts. In addition to the level-3 nature of the discourse itself,<br>the language analyst, as the unintended recipient of the message,<br>must deal with "Signals Intelligence factors" such as garbled text,<br>incomplete messages, lack of redundancy in the exchange,<br>uncertain context, and distortion. The demands on the language<br>analyst are high.<br>(S) The SLA also maintains a real-time Language Readiness Index<br>(LRI), which shows the percentage of cryptologic language<br>missions being prosecuted by "qualified" language analysts. (There<br>are over 6500 Cryptologic Language Analysts - CLAs - worldwide.)<br>CLAs are considered "qualified" if their language test scores are<br>equal to or higher than the language level required for their job.<br>The overall worldwide LRI is 51%, with 80% representing a<br>minimum acceptable risk. In other words, only half of the<br>missions are being prosecuted by qualified personnel .<br>(C) The number of mission areas that demand high-level language<br>proficiency continues to increase, with over 25% of current<br>cryptologic missions requiring a level higher than 3, requiring the<br>CLA to read and listen "beyond the lines." The language level for<br>many missions, particularly those related to counterterrorism and<br>force protection, continues to be measured at the extremely<br>difficult 4/4+ level because the targets "talk around" the subject<br>and use what appears to be almost gibberish metalanguage and<br>idiolects. Targets are communicating via a variety of 21st century<br>technologies, using very colloquial speech and writing in their<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Linguistic <br>1.

In April 2002,<br>DIRNSA documented for the record that the operational standard<br>required for NSA/CSS cryptologic language work is level 3/3. (See<br>announcement .)<br>(C) As you can see, the demands are great... but NSA/CSS is<br>taking steps to get the language capabilities it needs.
