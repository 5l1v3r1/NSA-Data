Aspatore<br>Language Enhancement Program Manager (S2)<br>Run Date: 10/28/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) What's one way NSA is "building the bench" of tomorrow's cryptologic language<br>analysts? - via the Language Enhancement Program (LEP), launched in January 04 by the<br>National Cryptologic School (NCS), the Senior Language Authority (SLA), and Human Resources<br>(HR). The LEP is an intensive global language training program which takes new hires with level<br>2/2 skills (limited working proficiency) in a commonly taught language such as French and crosstrains them to a level 3/3 (general professional proficiency) in a critically needed, lesscommonly-taught language like Arabic. It is loosely modeled on the successful Russian 15A<br>program of the 1980s.<br>(U//FOUO) The LEP also enables personnel who already have some knowledge of a critically<br>needed language to enhance their skills to a level 3/3 . Participants will be required to meet<br>specified level 2 and level 3 milestones. Depending on the language and the skill level of the<br>participant, the program could take up to three years to complete.<br>(U//FOUO) The NCS and SID have co-sponsored the refit of three floors of <br>(referred to as the Language Learning Center) to house both this effort and other training<br>programs related to the DIRNSA-required 3/3 language level . This unclassified facility houses<br>two state-of-the-art language learning laboratories, as well as a 21st century multimedia<br>language resource center. All classrooms are fitted with smart boards and laptop computers. The<br>second and third floors of the building have been completed and are in use. The NCS is staffing<br>the effort with teachers from the Defense Language Institute and from the local area.<br>(U//FOUO) To meet the FY04 hiring goal, the SLA, the NCS, HR, and Security launched an<br>intensive recruiting and hiring effort in February 2004. The overall FY04 hiring goal of 60 LEP<br>participants was met. Classes this October began cross-training participants into Arabic,<br>Chinese, Persian, and Korean. There are also enhancement classes in these languages. The LEP<br>will eventually train participants in Pashto and Turkish as well.<br>(U//FOUO) The FY05 Hiring Goal for LEP is an additional 60 participants. In FY05 LEP will also<br>include native or heritage speakers of Chinese and Korean who need to improve their English<br>skills. The English LEP, or E-LEP, hiring goal for FY05 is at least ten participants.<br>(U//FOUO) Please note that although the connection of the<br> facility with NSA<br>and its employees is U//FOUO, it is highly sensitive information. All are asked to assist in<br>keeping this a low-profile facility with no overt connection to NSA. All Agency personnel are<br>asked to remove their badges while visiting the facility. In addition, the <br> facility<br>is referred to as the "Language Learning Center" in an unclassified environment.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
