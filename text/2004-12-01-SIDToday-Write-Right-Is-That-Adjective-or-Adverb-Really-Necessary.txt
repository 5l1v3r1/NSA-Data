The governing principle can be summed up in this excerpt:<br>"SIGINT reporters must approach their jobs with the same frame of<br>mind as sign writers or telegram drafters, striving to get the<br>message across immediately. Our products make up a small<br>percentage of our customers' daily information deluge. If we want<br>them to be read, we must immediately capture the readers'<br>attention, hold their attention, and convey the message, i.e. the<br>intelligence."<br>(U) The purpose of today's column is twofold: to urge writers both<br>to be concise, and to examine their writing for unconscious cliches.<br>Is that adverb really needed? In other words, is it necessary for<br>the reader's understanding? For instance, was the effort "basically<br>fruitless" or was it "fruitless"? What does "basically" add?

"The test was successfully completed" is no<br>better than "the test was completed"; if you want to convey<br>something about the test RESULTS, you need a different term.<br>"The test was completed without delay, with satisfactory results,"<br>for instance.
