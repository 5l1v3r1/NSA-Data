DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) How It All Began, One Year Ago<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Run Date: 01/15/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>(U//FOUO) You may not have seen this in the newspapers, but it's a fact nonetheless: the protoSID today page first appeared a year ago today. It was called the "SID Message of the Day",<br>and was designed as a way for SID management to communicate regularly with the workforce.<br>(You may want to take a look at the first edition , for old time's sake.)<br>(U//FOUO) Things have changed a lot in 12 months! The MOTD became SID today on March<br>31st, switching from a management message to a "SID newspaper" format. Instead of a topdown comms path, we are now communicating top-down, bottom-up, and laterally across the<br>workforce. If SID today were an antenna, it would be omnidirectional!<br>(U//FOUO) The SID leadership has encouraged this development as a way of sharing information<br>throughout the Directorate. Our intent is to allow people to voice their opinions freely, even if<br>those views may be a little controversial at times. There are some constraints, of course, on<br>what we can publish. We can't get into political debates, or give a plug for a commercial product,<br>or post something that is antithetical to what SID stands for. But beyond that, people are free<br>(and encouraged) to voice their ideas.<br>(U//FOUO) We have a "Submit an article idea" button... please make use of it! Also, we would<br>like to hear your views of SID today ... let us know what you think of it!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
