This extremely sensitive<br>information needs greater safeguarding and limitations to access than the regular COMINT<br>Control Channels can provide. This material is controlled under a system called Exceptionally<br>Controlled Information (ECI) , the successor to the old (and now defunct) VRK system.<br>(U//FOUO) The ECI system is designed to maximize information sharing while still ensuring<br>adequate security. Each ECI program is known by a unique cover term abbreviated as a trigraph.<br>The person responsible for all matters concerning the conduct of an ECI program within an<br>organization is called the ECI Control Authority (CA).<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Policy 1-41, " The NSA/CSS Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI)<br>System ," establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for the management and administration<br>of the ECI System. The accompanying NSA/CSS Manual 1-41, " NSA/CSS Exceptionally<br>Controlled Information (ECI) System Guidance Manual ," provides procedural guidelines from the<br>SIGINT Directorate (SID) for the implementation, management, and administration of this<br>system. These and other policy documents can be found on the Office of Policy and Records web<br>site .<br>(U//FOUO) As the executive for the management of all NSA/CSS ECIs, SID has centralized and<br>streamlined the ECI approval process, as described in Manual 1-41. The SID/SIGINT Policy Staff<br>will help organizations move their ECI proposals through this process, and they also welcome<br>suggestions on how to make the process run more smoothly. Please direct your questions or<br>comments about ECI to the SIGINT Policy Staff at DL SID_POLICY or <br>@ems.nsa .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
