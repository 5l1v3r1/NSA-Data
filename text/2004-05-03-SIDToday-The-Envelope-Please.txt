We asked the readership to<br>choose the SID today article that was most memorable to them. (See the announcement .) Now<br>we can announce the winner of the coveted "Sidney" Award ! On Friday, SID Chief of Staff<br>Charles Berlin presented the inaugural Sidney Award plaque to<br> an Intelligence<br>Analysis intern, for her article "NISTing in Kabul and Baghdad."<br>(U//FOUO) The article originally ran as a two-part feature on December 9th and 10th, 2003.<br>Here is the complete text:<br>(U//FOUO) Being in the field will change the way you do SIGINT forever. This is what I told the<br>other analyst deploying to NIST Joint Task Force 20 (now 121) with me as we waited around<br>Rhein Main airbase for three days for a flight into Baghdad. He was a very experienced analyst,<br>one of the best we have at doing the geospatial analysis that is the mainstay of NISTs. I don't<br>know if he believed me at the time, but after we had been there for a few weeks, he told me<br>that I was right.<br>(U//FOUO) I had realized in Kabul that to be a really good analyst you have to know your<br>customer - not just know where he is located, or talk to him on the phone once a month. To sit<br>down with the people who will take action on your intelligence, whose lives you are helping to<br>protect, changes your perspective on our business like nothing else I can imagine. My name is<br> and I am an IA intern who deployed to Kabul and Baghdad on NIST teams.<br>(S//SI) A year ago, I volunteered to go to Kabul, Afghanistan, where I worked for four months<br>with the High-Value Targets cell comprising NSA, CIA, and DIA analysts, as well as military and<br>CIA operational elements. After a fabulous tour in Kabul, and with the war in Iraq creating a<br>large demand for NSA analysts in that region, I eagerly accepted an offer to head to Baghdad for<br>two months in the summer.<br>(U) Everything on our little corner of the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) was tan. The<br>sand, the tents, the HUMVEEs, the tee shirts, the food. As far as I could see, there was just dust<br>and tents and concertina wire. At first glance, the only things that weren't brown were the white<br>boxes that were our porta-potties. Even these were covered in so much dust and sand that they<br>couldn't be called white anymore. It truly looked like a wasteland. There were no trees, no<br>grass, no red cars, no yellow birds, nothing. All we had was a blue sky and the flag flying above<br>the compound.<br>(U//FOUO) When I first walked into the crumbling building which served as the Joint Operations<br>Command (JOC), I overheard someone asking whether I was someone's daughter come to visit.<br>After four months at NIST Kabul, I was used to rough conditions, long hours, and people looking<br>at me funny when I told them that I had volunteered to be there. I knew that there wouldn't be<br>many other women working with me at TF-20, the elite command of all-male Special Operations<br>soldiers tasked with prosecuting High-Value Targets in Iraq.<br>(U) For the first few days, as in Kabul, everyone hid their stacks of "men's magazines" and<br>painfully avoided telling off-color jokes for fear of an EEO lawsuit. But when people asked me<br>why I was there, I answered, "for the same reason you are." After a short while, they realized<br>that this was true.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) Everyone on the compound lived in a tent city. They were magnificently air conditioned, and<br>ours was kept pitch black inside to accommodate the various shifts that team members worked.<br>I never unpacked anything - we all just rummaged through our bags in the dark with small redlens flashlights. There was not much to worry about finding, since I wore the same thing every<br>day. One of the many benefits of working for a Special Operations command was that they<br>allowed for relaxed grooming standards and had alternative uniform regulations.<br>(U) While many people on BIAP had to wear full DCUs (desert camouflage uniforms) despite the<br>125-degree heat, we wore PT gear - black shorts and a brown tee shirt. I only donned my DCU<br>pants when I had to get "dressed up" for a VIP visit. This was a much-appreciated blessing,<br>since the heat was almost unbearable. When I arrived, I suffered heat cramps for a few days<br>which made me walk around on my toes like a dinosaur. At least I was providing some<br>entertainment for the troops, I kept telling myself.<br>(U) The food was bland but not bad. We had a chow hall which served four hot meals a day.<br>Many were basically mass-reheated MREs, but the hamburgers were nothing to complain about.<br>Living on Zulu time (Greenwich Mean Time) and not local time was an interesting experience. I<br>went to sleep as the sun was coming up and constantly felt jet-lagged. The rest of BIAP, it<br>seemed, was running on local time, so it added a hurdle when coordinating meetings.<br>(U/FOUO) The work with TF-20 was the best I've had the opportunity to be a part of so far in my<br>career at NSA. I was lucky to be working with such an able and flexible command. Like most<br>NISTs, we worked 7 days a week, at least 13 or 14 hours a day. Whenever an operation was in<br>progress, which was almost every day, we worked until it was done.<br>(S//SI) A majority of our work consisted of identifying and tracking targets using PCS (Personal<br>Communication Service) handsets. We worked closely with the DIA interrogators, CIA case<br>officers, all-source analysts, and many others to produce timely, actionable intelligence.<br>Sometimes we made PowerPoint presentations of our findings, and other times we just made<br>our case with verbal briefings or diagrams sketched out on the white board. We did a lot of<br>educating non-SIGINTers on our capabilities and limitations, and I learned an incredible amount<br>about the other players in the intelligence community and military structure.<br>(S//SI) Too often, I noticed, what we think is urgent and earth-shattering may not be what our<br>customer really needs. If you can't get the right product to the right person in time, it may not<br>be of any value at all. On several occasions, we were able to hand additional threat-related<br>information to team leaders heading out the door on an operation, just in time. Five minutes<br>later, that same intelligence would have been just wasted time and paper. I had an amazing<br>experience working in Baghdad and have gained a perspective on the value of SIGINT that I<br>hope never to lose.<br>(U//FOUO) Congratulations to <br> the first Sidney winner!
