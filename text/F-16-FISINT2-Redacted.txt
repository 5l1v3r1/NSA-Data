(S//SI/TK//REL) During the recent unrest in the Gaza Strip in January, Menwith Hill
Station FISINT operators collected video for the first time from the cockpit of an Israeli
Air Force F-16 fighter jet. The day before, MHS FISINT operators collected video from
an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV appeared to still be on the ground, which
prompted the site to go back to the area again the next day. As a result, MHS collected
the F-16 heads-up display that showed a target on the ground being tracked. MHS
worked closely with a GCHQ site in Cyprus for tip-offs.

(S//SI//REL) Reacting to the unrest in the Gaza Strip, MHS conducted ad hoc range
surveillance. On 3 January, the site collected the aircraft video from an Israeli F-16
fighter. The 14-second long video showed an “unbroken line” running through the
targeting display, indicating that the target being tracked was on the ground.1
