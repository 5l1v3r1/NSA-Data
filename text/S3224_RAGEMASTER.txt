RAGEMASTER

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) RF retro-reflector that provides an enhanced radar
cross-section for VAGRANT collection. It's concealed in a standard computer video
graphics array (VGA) cable between the video card and video monitor. It’s typically
installed in the ferrite on the video cable.

(U) Capabilities

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) RAGEMASTER provides a target for RF flooding
and allows for easier collection of the VAGRANT video signal. The current
RAGEMASTER unit taps the red video line on the VGA cable. It was found that,
empirically, this provides the best video return and cleanest readout of the
monitor contents.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) The RAGEMASTER taps the red video line
between the video card within the desktop unit and the computer monitor,
typically an LCD. When the RAGEMASTER is illuminated by a radar unit, the
illuminating signal is modulated with the red video information. This information
is re-radiated, where it is picked up at the radar, demodulated, and passed
onto the processing unit, such as a LFS-2 and an external monitor,
NIGHTWATCH, GOTHAM, or (in the future) VIEWPLATE. The processor
recreates the horizontal and vertical sync of the targeted monitor, thus allowing
TAO personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor.
