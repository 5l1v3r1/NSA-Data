BADDECISION Overview

CLOSE
ACCESS

^ BADDECISION is an “802.11 CNE tool that
uses a true man-in-the-middle attack and a
frame injection technique to redirect a
target client to a FOXACID server.”

>• Takes advantage of shared open medium
and the HTTP protocol.

^ Works for WPA / WPA2!

Overview of

Operational

Scenario

>- Operator with

BLINDDATE

System.

FOXACID Tag
issued for Target.

>- Target Client
browsing the
Internet via web
browser ©

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

Webpage Request

>- Target issues
HTTP GET Request
to webpage of
interest (cnn.com)

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

Injection

>- Operate uses
SECONDDATE to
inject a redirection
payload at Target
Client.

»■ Target Client’s
original HTTP GET
Request continues
on it’s normal path.

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

Refresh and
Covert Request

>- Injected payload
forces Target Client
to refresh and send
another HTTP GET
Request to desired
webpage.

Covert Request
is issued by Target
Client to FOXACiD
Server.

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN

FOXACID
Request Received

» FOXACID
receives request
from entity.

»■ Entity is
validated as Target
Client by FOXACID
Tag.

Response to
original HTTP GET
Request is dropped
(but don’t worry,
that’s good)

Pros

Works for WPA / WPA2 networks.	I

5^ Can reliability see all communications
between target and FOXACID.

Cons

Larger signature than NIGHTSTAND.	I

Requires higher SNR to maintain reliable
communications between target and FOXACID.
