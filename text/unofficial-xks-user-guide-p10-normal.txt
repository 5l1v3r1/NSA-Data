Phone Number Extractor

The Phone Number Extractor query looks through the content of an email for phone
numbers. This is very similar to a PINWALE DoPhone query except the traffic that
XKEYSCORE finds may be survey (i.e., unselected, non-tasked data) and might not be
in PINWALE. XKEYSCORE may be your only hope at finding an email address for a
target where you only have their phone number as lead information.

1. Already have a phone number? If all you have to start with as lead information is
a phone number, you may find it useful to query on that phone number and see if
anyone sent an email with that number in the signature line.
