Thanks to all who sent in their<br>anecdotes!<br>From:<br> <br>Org: Requirements Analysis Center (S16)<br>(U//FOUO) As luck would have it, I did meet the Reagans in Berlin<br>when they hosted a "Birthday Party for Berlin" in the late 80's. As<br>President Reagan was speaking, a folding chair fell over (loudly) in<br>the balcony. Mrs. Reagan turned white for a second, but the<br>President in his typical humorous way, simply looked up and said<br>"You missed me." The entire group let out an anxious sigh followed<br>quickly by laughter.<br>From:<br> <br>Org: CIA Liaison Support Group (F51)<br>(U//FOUO) Like many on the White House staff, my most direct<br>contact with President Reagan was during a grip-and-grin photo<br>opportunity for those of us assigned to the White House Situation<br>Room where I was a watch officer from January 1986 to March<br>1988. What struck me most was that he was shorter than I<br>expected - not the larger than life figure that you expect from<br>television - but he still had that warmth that everyone talked<br>about. The other weird thing about it was that the rest of the<br>National Security Council were filed out of the conference room and<br>sort of followed the President going through the receiving line.<br>(U) My only other direct contact with him was on West Executive<br>Avenue, which is between the West Wing and the Old Executive<br>Office Building. As usual, the Secret Service was clearing a path for<br>Reagan when he was walking between the buildings, so I was told<br>to stand off the to the side. The President was 20 feet from me and<br>sends a wave and smile in my direction. I, of course, think, "Whom<br>was he waving at?" I look and realize I'm the only around.<br>Somewhat embarrassed, I quickly turn back and gave him a big<br>wave in return.<br>(S//SI) My most notable indirect contact with him was his use of<br>an update on terrorist bombing of a US Air Force bus by the Greek<br>"November 17" terrorist group. I, along with another NSAer, wrote<br>a one-paragraph update on the bombing, which went to President<br>Reagan. About 15 minutes later, we were watching CNN do a photo<br>op in the Oval Office. Almost immediately, a member of the press<br>asked about the bombing in Greece. To my amazement, the<br>President responded just about word for word with the note we had<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.  InSIDer's View of<br>History ...

That's when I knew that he had a<br>near-photographic memory.<br>(U//FOUO) The biggest question in the minds of many was how<br>engaged the President was. While I can't speak to the larger<br>issues, I can say that I've been a "fly on the wall" during a National<br>Security Council meeting and was quite stunned to hear the<br>President as an active and forceful participant in the meeting. Just<br>another small way he changed my perception of a man that had<br>been shaped by a press that really didn't know him.<br><br>12.  In SID er's View of<br>History : Quite a<br>Welcome!<br>13.  In SID er's View of<br>History : The<br>Adventure Continues<br>-- Evacuation from<br>Belgrade<br><br>From:<br>(U) I did get the honor to meet President Reagan when he<br>dedicated the Ops-2 buildings. I remember that I was not planning<br>to attend his visit to the agency, because I thought the crowd<br>would be too large and that the parking would be impossible. But<br>when the time and date arrived, I told myself that I would try to<br>see him, if the parking was not impossible. I drove to the main<br>four buildings and was fortunate enough to find a distant parking<br>spot. I walked to the back of the crowd who were waiting for the<br>President's helicopter and him. I waited for a several minutes and<br>thought that I would not be able to see him because of the<br>distance between the podium and me. All of a sudden, a lady from<br>protocol waved the small group I was standing with to the last row<br>of seating in the VIP section. That row was nearly empty and they<br>wanted to fill it. I sat 50 feet or so from President Reagan when he<br>addressed the Agency workforce.<br>(U) I remember him telling a story about how he was going to get<br>to NSA. He said he was told to go to 12th and K street and that he<br>would be picked up by an unmarked van and taken to NSA. He told<br>us how much he valued our contributions to national security and<br>the global prominence of United States. He told us that most of<br>America and the world did not know of the significant of your work,<br>but he knew and he wanted us to continue our labors in silence.<br>(U) I have great respect for him, because he had a vision, a<br>national strategy, and the ability to communicate them. I am<br>saddened for my, the country's, and the world's loss, but I am also<br>enthusiastic and optimistic about our future. I have learned much<br>from him and other great leaders over the years. I know that great<br>leaders have a vision of the future, a strategy on how to get there,<br>the ability to communicate them to everyone, and can laugh every<br>once in a while at themselves. On Friday, I will reflect back on his<br>vision of America, the situation we were in at the time, and the<br>rapid growth the agency experienced in the 80's. I will also keep<br>alive his vision of how great America is and will be in the future.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$2.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
