(S//SI//REL) SIGINT Seniors Pacific: Successes and Future CT Goals Highlighted at Conference
FROM:

SSPAC Exec (DP14)

Run Date: 03/16/2007

(S//SI//REL) The Counterterrorism-focused SSPAC alliance sets goals, notes remarkable progress at the
analytic level.

(S//SI//REL) In November 2006, NSA officials* and representatives of seven other nations met in Chiang
Mai, Thailand, for the second annual SIGINT Seniors Pacific (SSPAC) conference. The Principals came
together to review SSPAC progress over the last year and set strategic direction for the next year.

(U) Progress at the Analytic Level

(S//SI//REL) At the conference, Principals looked back at the remarkable progress the alliance had made
over the last year starting with the inaugural Analytic Conference hosted by New Zealand in March. This
was the first time counterterrorism (CT) analysts from all eight nations met face-to-face and collaborated
and networked. Nations presented a country counterterrorism briefing and shared information on targets as
well as ways to increase the effectiveness of the alliance. These ways included the need to:

•	use a common information-sharing communications network;

•	share language capabilities;

•	exchange unique information on CT targets in the region, analytic methodologies, tools and
terrorism tradecraft; and

•	exchange information on financial activity used to facilitate extremist activity.

Where the senior leadership of respective agencies had agreed on the concept and shape of SSPAC, it was
at the analytic level where success was being demonstrated.

(U) Other Recent Highlights

(S//SI//REL) Over the year, SSPAC members issued 70 intelligence reports on CT targets and activities;
half of those came from NSA. In addition, SSPAC nations identified 20 terrorist groups as strategic
interests and assembled detailed summaries or "target templates" on six of them. NSA/CSS Hawaii
(HS2I), for example, assembled a template on the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), an Islamist terrorist
separatist group based in southern Philippines whose spokesman, Abu Solaiman - the accused mastermind
of Southeast Asia's worst terror attacks and who had ties to al-Qaida - was killed by US-backed troops on
16 January 2007. (See related article.) Templates have increased SSPAC's corporate stock of knowledge
and will be assembled on the remaining 14 terrorist groups in the months ahead.

was killed by US-backed troops in January 2007.

(S//SI//REL) SSPAC also assembled a Language Composite in 2006 that lists each member's capabilities
in Asian-Pacific languages that they would be willing to offer to the alliance. Additionally, the composite
shows the languages that each member would welcome assistance on from others. Nations can now turn to
other members for language assistance (on a limited basis, as operations permit), with CRUSHED ICE
providing a timely means for transferring voice files. Processes for making use of such language support
among SSPAC nations are still being developed.

(U//FOUO) CRUSHED ICE: The SSPAC Communications Network

(S//SI//REL) SSPAC nations needed a common network where all members could communicate and share
information on a timely basis. NSA developed a stand-alone secure system called CRUSHED ICE,
modeled after the technology of CENTER ICE, the tactical collaboration system used by 14 nations in
Afghanistan. (See related article.) CRUSHED ICE is deployed in each nation's headquarters and serves as
the national SIGINT communications vehicle for SSPAC much like SIGDASYS does for SIGINT Seniors
Europe. The system was deployed to most of the SSPAC nations by year's end (with Singapore and
Canada due to go on-line in February) and is designed so that virtual teams can work collaboratively on
the same data, thus adding value to anything one nation might achieve individually. The demonstration
given to the Principals on 14 November marked the symbolic stand-up of CRUSHED ICE.

(S//SI//REL) SSPAC Membership

(S//SI//REL) One of the most frequent questions asked by NSA folks is why isn't Japan a member of
SSPAC? At the time the alliance was formed, many other Asian nations were considered as potential
members, including Japan. Japan was the only nation who was actually offered membership but turned it
down. At the time, Japan expressed concerns that unintended disclosure of its participation would be too
high a risk and had other reasons as well. SSPAC Principals, however, have been discussing the
membership issue at their level and will raise it as a topic for the next Principals meeting in October 2007.
The Executive Board has also been laying groundwork in this discussion in addition to raising ideas for
expanding SSPAC's intelligence focus beyond counterterrorism. The decision to add new members or to
collaborate on other shared threats such as proliferation must be made by a consensus vote by the
Principals.

(U) The Way Forward for 2007

(S//SI//REL) Back to the recent conference in Chiang Mai, the Principals set the direction for "The Way
Forward 2007" by laying out ten strategic goals** for the year. These goals will provide the platform for
deepening analytic ties among SSPAC members and increasing awareness of CT threats, thus
strengthening our corporate ability to pursue new potential threats. What kept the Principals so optimistic
was not only the remarkable progress over the last year but the frank and open discussions among
members. This is especially noteworthy considering the alliance is still in its infancy stages.

(S//SI//REL) What's next on the immediate horizon? SSPAC CT analysts will be gathering again, this time
in Hawaii, on 24-27 April. Many of the details for reaching the 2007 strategic goals will be worked out at
this level, such as developing processes for providing support to international events, collaborating on CT
targets, and building operational guidelines for CRUSHED ICE. With CRUSHED ICE in place,
expectations are even higher this year, making use of weekly virtual analytic meetings and other means to
counter terrorist threats in the Asian Pacific region.
