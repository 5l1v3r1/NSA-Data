A great example of Transformation 2.0, Petal One<br>collaboration." This article describes that collaboration.<br>(S//SI) NSA and GCHQ are teaming on a comprehensive collaboration on exploitation of<br>terrestrial RF (radio frequency) communications in a program known as the Joint Strategic OffAir Programme (Joint Programme). This effort has already made an impact on the SIGINT<br>mission and recently was applied to provide the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) an<br>assessment of communications security of the U.S. forces in Iraq.<br>(S//SI) The Joint Programme was established in December 2002 with a groundbreaking<br>Principles of Agreement signed by the Directors of NSA and GCHQ. NSA is revitalizing its<br>terrestrial RF collection capability by leveraging GCHQ's developing HF/VHF/UHF collection<br>architecture known as GLAIVE. To meet U.S. intelligence needs, GLAIVE systems were deployed<br>to Kuwait before the start of military operations in Iraq and then to Balad, Iraq in December<br>2003. These systems provide the SIGINT mission with access to local communications for force<br>protection and also significant regional collection.<br>(S//SI) On April 14, 2004, <br> (an NSA member of the Joint Programme executive<br>board) and <br> (Corporate HF Services (CHS, S3311), briefed the Joint COMSEC<br>Monitoring Activity (JCMA, I422) on GLAIVE capabilities and current signals access.<br>(S//SI) As a result of that briefing, JCMA contacted CHS on 22 April with a request to task the<br>VHF/UHF receivers on the GLAIVE remote collection facility (RCF) in Balad, Iraq. HF Mission<br>Management coordinated logistics and receiver availability with their GCHQ counterparts while<br>JCMA drafted and submitted the requisite SURREY requirement, provided frequencies and signal<br>routing information, and forwarded legal certification to perform the mission. On 24 April, using<br>the GLAIVE workstations located in the Meade Operations Center to access the RCF in Balad,<br>Iraq (via the RAF Digby remote operations facility), JCMA began monitoring Family Radio<br>Service (FRS) and Global Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios being used by deployed U.S.<br>personnel.<br>(C) This initiative is an outstanding example of SID/IAD collaboration and joint mission<br>management with GCHQ, which resulted in a mission coming on line in less than 2 1/2 working<br>days. JCMA continues to monitor the FRS/GMRS frequencies on a not-to-interfere basis and<br>report results to their COMSEC customer.<br>(C) This exercise is not only an example of SID and IAD working together to keep our troops<br>safe, but it also brings GCHQ into the equation as we begin living the vision of Transformation<br>2.0!<br>(FOUO) Watch for more SID Today articles on the Joint Programme in the coming months.<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
