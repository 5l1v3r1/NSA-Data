Now,<br>however, "CSP" can also refer to a new customer engagement vehicle being developed in S11<br>(Customer Gateway), namely the Customer Support Plan. The S11 CSP is a service-level<br>contract for products and services between SID and its customers. The plan documents strategic<br>intelligence needs, the required level of SIGINT service, and a description of the customer<br>information space. It also includes an action plan that lays out the necessary steps for improved<br>services and support.<br>(U//FOUO) These CSPs are developed using the SCORECARD process. Here's how it works: the<br>Customer SCORECARD is a series of personal interviews (it is not a survey!) conducted by<br>NCRs/SEAMs* and/or Account Managers within a customer set. The interview questions are<br>standardized for all 50-plus customers and include both numerical evaluations of how well we<br>are meeting customer needs, and open-ended questions about customer strategic direction and<br>their "NSA wish list." SCORECARD data is then compiled into action plans and codified in the<br>CSP.<br>(U//FOUO) The CSP action plans are vetted with Target Offices of Primary Interest (TOPIs) and<br>key enablers to determine areas where we can improve our support, and to also determine<br>issues for which NSA will not be able to provide help to our customers. A completed CSP is then<br>communicated back to the customer as the "service level contract" for the next 12 months. Data<br>used in this process is also available to the corporation to make strategic mission and resource<br>decisions.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on S11 Customer Engagement Strategy go to<br> and click on the new SID Customer Engagement<br>Strategy link at the top of the page.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>NCR = NSA/CSS Representative <br>SEAM = Senior Executive Account Manager <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
