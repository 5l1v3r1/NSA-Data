(S//REL) High Level Goals

S Detect (all!) botnet activity on our sensors

-	Alert only when activity is relevant and time-sensitive

»Involves entities/commanding of high interest
»Involves protected areas
»Could initiate defensive action

-	Generate metadata always

»Aids in attribution and retrospective analysis

-	Enrich metadata as much as possible

»Alleviate the need for in-depth knowledge of actors or malware

CAPABII_ITq

(S//REL) What we offer today

s An extensible botnet processing service

-	Capabilities are added via configuration or specialized processors

s The ability to track events spanning across 5-tuples

-	Enables production of Event Summaries and Enrichment

® Geographical dispersion

-	SIGINT perspective, currently at SCS sites and MHS (prototype)

s TURMOIL augments Defensive Efforts two fold

-	Early warning Tips for defensive action (to NETEZZA, then
TUTELAGE)

-	Metadata for characterization and to support attribution (to
GMPLACE and RONIN, then CYBERCLOUD and MARINA).

S' Advancements

-	Zeus RC4 encrypted processing flow

-	Base64 decoding e.g. BEB vl.8 target IP extraction

-	Limited Metadata Enrichment

» Case Study to support QBOT activities

-	Deployment to F6 sites and a second system at MHS

-	Established ASDF to GMPLACE for GHOSTMACHINE analytics

-	Established flow to NETEZZA (TURQI) for validation

-	Defined Botnet Lifecycle Model for categorizing enrichment

(S//REL) Current Development Focus

O' Attain analyst validation

-	Ingest into GM and creating Views

-	End-to-end dataflow validation

o Improve Metadata Enrichment capabilities

-	Define generic model to create metadata PCRE rules

-	Refine Enrichment Model for Malware

0 Improvements to function as a framework/service

-	Greater focus on metadata enrichment

o Provide dynamic AEG tasking
® Re-factor Tasking and Tips to fit botnets

-	Update Tip format to closely align with extracted data

o Add specialized packet processors

-	Mariposa

-	Looking for opportunities

(S//REL) Future Work

o initial development

-	Initiate promotion (to XKS) or collection flows

-	Re-factor SEG to make Metadata Enrichment more flexible

-	Redesign the Analytic to provide more valuable Summaries

» Possibly detect point of origin of Herder commanding

© Biggest Challenges

-	Currently have no means to track peer-to-peer botnet activity

» May look to current TURMOIL Fast Flux capabilities for ideas

-	Encrypted bots defeat most attempts at tracking and reporting

» Possible candidate for TURMOIL Re-Injection flow

(S//REL) “Categorizing” Existing Signatures

S' Most popular bot signature analyst repositories:

-	BLUESMOKE: Snort Rules

-	XKEYSCORE: Fingerprints

s Requires author to add extra detail to the existing
signature

s Requires front end tools to add extra fields to their
GUIs for analyst input

-	Suggested that the Lifecycle Stage Group and Stage
Instance be required for submission for botnet signatures
