*	(TS//S17NF) The Genua ns may bring up the subject of SKYPE. NSA’s response
has been that it has had some success working SKATE via tailored access at the
end point by gaining access to one or more of the computers involved in the
session. When Hr. Klaus-Fritsche (State Secnetaiy, Germany Ministiy of Interior)
sought NSA’s assistance with intercepting SKYPE transmissions during a 10
January 2012 meeting with D1RNSA, D1RNSA suggested the DN1 Representative
Berlin take the lead in arranging an exchange to include CIA, FBI and NSA.
Should the partner raise this issue again, recommend that NSA once again
redirects them to FBI and CIA.

*	(S//NF) The Geimans have previously approached NSA about using information
derived from S1GJNT in open court. CT is concerned that exposing S1GJNT
capabilities in Getman court threatens the ability to maintain the desired and
planned for level of SIGINT cooperation.

technical exchanges.

and importance of using behavior detection techniques to identify unknown
extremists wras discussed several times in 2012 with both BND and BfV and CT
sees great value in working closely with both German partners on these analytic
tra dec raft methodologies. The next meeting to further discuss behavior detection
is scheduled for 10-11 April in Bad Aibling with the BND and BfV. These
sessions are specifically focused on understanding, creating, and implementing
discovery capabilities through XKEYSCORE. Ultimately, CTs goal is to gain
benefit by collaborating on Geiman extremists tai^gets once the BfV has, and is

(TS/.REL TO USA, FVEY) The primary stakeholders for CT exchanges with the
Germans are the European Ciyp to logic Center (ECC) and the S21 Deployed Analyst (DA
) in Berlin. NSA’s CT meets writh the BND and BfV quarterly and with the BND eveiy
six months at SJSECT. The latest analytic exchange wras on4-S December 2012 in
Berlin. Although previous discussions focused on extremists traveling to Germany and
Central Asia, this latest exchange focused heavily on North African CT topics, including
key presentations from both sides on	CT European tai^gets

remain the focus of the relationship with BfV; howrever, it is likely that CT North African
targets will have an expanded focus with BND and BfV as North Africa continues to
serve as a magnet for aspiting jihadists from Europe. In addition, future discussions will
likely expand to Europeans traveling to^^|to fight in the ongoing^^Jand the threat
they may pose upon return to Europe.

(TS//51//NF) In addition, SSG has been working with the BND and BfV on collection as
wrell as target discovery and development trade craft In October 2011, SSG partnered
with SUSLAG and BND to conduct a demonstration of XKEYSCORE to the BfV using
BfV domestic warranted collection. The BND XKEYSCORE system successfully
processed DSL wiretap collection belonging to a German domestic CT tai^et. As a result
of this demonstration, the BfV Vice President formally requested the XKEYSCORE
software from D1RNSA to further enable the BfV to achieve its mission goal of
countering terrorist activities in Germany. By enhancing BfV’s Internet analytic
capabilities through the provision of XKEYSCORE, NS A will enable Getmany to
provide unique contributions in the form of collection, data summaries, and/or finished
intelligence to the high-priority NSA CT mission. The SPF approving the provision of
XKEYSCORE to the BfV wras approved on 25 March 2013. The Terms of Reference
related to this effort is currently with the Germans for signature, wfiich is expected in
mid-April.
