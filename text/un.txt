(TS//SI//NF) United Nations DNI Collection Enabled

(TS//SI//NF) FAIRVIEW and BLARNEY engineers collaborated to enable
the delivery of 700Mbps of paired packet switched traffic (DNI)
traffic from access to an 0C192 ring serving the United Nations
mission in New York. The traffic in these links had been encoded
using a specific multiplexing technique (GFP). FAIRVIEW engineers
and the partner worked to provide the correct mapping, and BLARNEY
worked with the partner to correct data quality issues so the data
could be handed off to BLARNEY engineers to enable processing of the
DNI traffic.

(TS//SI//NF) As of 4 April, BLARNEY began intermittent enablement of
DNI traffic for TOPI assessment and feedback. This feedback is being
used by the BLARNEY target development team to support an ongoing
filtering and throttling of data volumes. While BLARNEY is
authorized full-take access under the NSA FISA, collected data
volumes would flood PINWALE allocations within hours without a
robust filtering mechanism. The initial TOPI feedback has been
positive, indicating unique collection to include collection against
the email address of the UN General leading the monitoring mission
in	BLARNEY engineers and analysts assessment indicate

high quality in both VoIP and VTC collection.
