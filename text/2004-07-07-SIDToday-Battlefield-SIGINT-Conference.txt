DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Battlefield SIGINT Conference<br>FROM: <br>CES Military Operations Staff (S31094)<br>Run Date: 07/07/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) On 25-26 May 2004, Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES - S31) hosted its<br>first-ever BATTLEFIELD SIGINT CONFERENCE. The conference succeeded in gathering key<br>SIGINT partners from across the Extended Enterprise to discuss how to move toward improved<br>national/tactical integration in support of military operations. Attendees included representatives<br>from the Service Cryptologic Elements (SCE), service engineering/technical offices, collection<br>management staffs of the theater and unified commands, 2nd Party SIGINT partners, the<br>Regional Security Operations Centers, and NSA.<br>(U//FOUO) A host of briefings were presented during the two-day conference. On the first day,<br>the Chiefs of CES and NTIO (National Tactical Integration Office - S14) provided an overview of<br>how battlefield SIGINT looks from their perspective and discussed actions that should be taken<br>to meet the challenges posed by new technologies. Also provided were a number of<br>presentations about key NSA initiatives, such as a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tactical effort<br>called PINERIDGE and Net-centric Exploitation Applications via the Distributed Common Ground<br>System .<br>(U//FOUO) The second day included an in-depth look at NTI from a tactical perspective.<br>Presentations included a review of the requirements message format that CES is currently<br>implementing to make the process used by the military to request cryptanalysis support faster<br>and easier. Two of NSA's 2nd Party SIGINT partners presented their country's NTI efforts, and<br>the FAD/Military Affairs Advisor briefed 3rd Party relations and how they impact the use of hostnation airspace, land and sea-lanes by the U.S. for SIGINT purposes. Each SCE briefed its<br>strategy for NTI, often referencing "lessons learned" from cooperation with NSA during recent<br>deployments.<br>(U//FOUO) A major point of discussion was centered on the move away from tactical "black<br>boxes" toward processes whereby military customers can directly leverage cryptanalytic<br>capabilities when the exploitation systems themselves cannot, due to technological and<br>analytical factors, be forward deployed to combat venues as self-contained packages. In these<br>cases, combat commanders must be able to routinely benefit from cryptanalysis via a virtual<br>"black box" made up of geographically separate and distant exploitation systems and analysts<br>that dependably disseminate actionable intelligence when needed to front line forces.<br>(U//FOUO) A recurring theme during the conference was that as steps are being taken by<br>members of the extended enterprise to improve SIGINT NTI, conferences like the BSC are<br>needed to review their status, ensure they are being taken in the same direction, and provide a<br>venue to honestly discuss potential disagreements about the implementation of the individual<br>steps in an open forum. BSC attendees understood that advances in communications technology<br>coupled with the large number of potential SIGINT targets means that the distinction between<br>national and tactical no longer exists - everyone must act as partners in one seamless enterprise<br>to provide the best possible intelligence for customers.<br>(U//FOUO) To view the conference agenda, list of attendees and presentations, you can visit CES<br>homepage at the following URL: <br> .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
