For example, this includes data used to route the communication, details<br>needed for billing, tracking or authentication, formatting, etc. All of the SIGINT System's wideranging activities to collect, analyze, present, and use COMINT metadata are summed up in the<br>SID Metadata Strategy .<br>(S//SI) For SID's Deputy Directorate for Data Acquisition (DA, S3), the Metadata Strategy goes<br>beyond the obvious requirements for DA to develop and access metadata: DA is recognized as<br>playing an important analytic role and as such is a critical customer of the Strategy, as well as a<br>provider. It is also important to recognize that no element of the Strategy belongs to an<br>individual line organization within SID -- implementation of all of its components must be<br>orchestrated across the many stakeholder organizations.<br>(S//SI) The end-to-end vision of the Metadata Strategy includes:<br>A Global Metadata Service that delivers all the metadata necessary for SID's analytic<br>needs;<br>Automated analysis that both frees the analyst from repetitive tasks and discovers<br>potentially lucrative information;<br>Tools, tailored to an analyst's needs, for presenting metadata information; and<br>Making metadata associated with targets and technologies immediately accessible to the<br>collection systems, for constant improvement of the quality of COMINT.<br>(S//SI) During the first six months of the Strategy implementation, the lead team has focused<br>on areas related to Digital Network Intelligence (DNI), specifically target-related metadata. For<br>example, we are:<br>Developing a new DNI "rich" metadata architecture and a strategy for achieving the<br>Global Metadata Service;<br>Merging tasking interfaces;<br>Creating DNI contact chaining through MAINWAY ;<br>Incorporating DNI communication event data into FASCIA ; and<br>Pursuing new storage paradigms (e.g. CONDENSER) that meet wide-ranging needs.<br>(S//SI) More broadly, work continues across SID on everything from link and network<br>characterization, to advanced analytic techniques in research. There are four full-time members<br>of the Strategy team, a larger "core" team working on a wide variety of implementation aspects<br>and guiding the strategy, and others working the development and advancement of analytic<br>methods. Details of the Strategy can be found at " go metadata " on NSAnet. The team can be<br>contacted via email at "DL METADATA".<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
