The Pentagon, the<br>military commands, State Department, the White House? Would you think to include the<br>Environmental Protection Agency, the Export-Import Bank, or the Department of Health and<br>Human Services on your list of regular readers?<br>(U//FOUO) These and several other federal agencies fall into a category of non-Intelligence<br>Community, non-DOD customers that do not need full-time NSA liaison reps but that do,<br>nevertheless, depend on SIGINT to make key decisions. The Washington Liaison Office,<br>affectionately known as the WLO, services these customers from its location in the U.S. Secret<br>Service building in downtown Washington, D.C. The WLO consists of two liaison officers whose<br>primary mission is to tend to the SIGINT needs of the following active customers:<br>Department of Agriculture<br>Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br>Department of Interior<br>Department of Transportation<br>Environmental Protection Agency<br>Export-Import Bank<br>Federal Aviation Administration<br>Federal Communications Commission<br>Federal Reserve System<br>National Aeronautics and Space Administration<br>(U//FOUO) What makes the WLO different than other embedded liaison offices is first and<br>foremost the fact that it is not co-located with any of its customers. Another significant<br>difference is that the WLO's customers usually have competing priorities totally unknown to each<br>other requiring a delicate balancing act in providing timely SIGINT to all. For example, what the<br>Secretary of Agriculture needs for her afternoon meeting with EU representatives is completely<br>different from what the NASA Administrator needs prior to his visit to India.<br>(U//FOUO) On a daily basis, the WLO officers reassess priorities based on international, national,<br>departmental, and NSA events to maintain this delicate balance among the customers with an<br>objective of each customer believing its crisis is the WLO's #1 priority. Similar to NCRs and<br>SIGINT Liaison Officers, the WLO also acts as a conduit to all of NSA's resources, including<br>counterintelligence, security, IT, and information assurance.<br>(S//SI) The subject-matter interests of these many customers are quite diverse and provide<br>outstanding opportunities to learn about topics from bovine spongiform encephalopathy to space<br>launch vehicle capabilities; from narcotics interdiction techniques to wine labeling regulations;<br>from toxin delivery technologies to secure communications options, and much, much more. The<br>WLO has regular interaction with TOPIs* from ten of the twelve SID Product Lines.<br>(U//FOUO) A day in the life of a WLO officer includes, of course, reviewing SIGINT for timesensitive reporting of interest to all customers in the portfolio. As in any liaison position, it is<br>only after building personal relationships with the many customers that a WLO rep gets to know<br>not only the intelligence needs of each and every customer but also their individual briefing<br>preferences. For example, some customers prefer to read entire reports; some, such as U.S.<br>Cabinet members, prefer short, summarized briefings.<br><br> </p>(U) Once the daily reporting is reviewed, selections made, and briefings prepared, the WLO<br>team effects delivery in time for action. Since most of these non-intel agencies have small, if<br>any, intelligence-support staffs and very limited secure-communication capabilities, delivery of<br>SIGINT in a timely manner most often involves a Metro ride. WLO customers are spread out all<br>over downtown, the closest being about six blocks from the WLO office, a very nice walk on a<br>spring or fall day.<br>(U) There are numerous fringe benefits to a position at the WLO: getting trim and fit walking<br>around downtown every day, learning esoteric tidbits, engaging in discussions with senior<br>Administration officials, and getting first-hand feedback on the significance of NSA reporting.<br>(U) SIGINT is critical to these customers and there are success stories from each and every one.<br>Look for future articles on specific departments that the WLO supports. In the meantime, if you<br>think you have a product or service that might be of interest to these little-known customers, or<br>if you think they have something that might be of interest to you, contact <br> or <br>A convenient list of all of SID's customer liaison representatives, including the<br>.<br>WLO officers, can be found at <br>*(U) Notes: <br>TOPI = Target Office of Primary Interest <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
