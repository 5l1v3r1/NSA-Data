The terrorist, named Umar Baziyani, had served as a<br>close aide to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, helping to direct a series of attacks on U.S. and allied forces<br>in Iraq. Several SIGINT elements helped geolocate Baziyani who, like other al-Qa'ida members,<br>was using Internet cafes in Baghdad to communicate. SIGINTers effectively combined<br>information gathered across accesses and environments to support this capture. New uses of<br>SIGINT data, including metadata, also played an essential role.<br>(TS//SI//REL) The following SIGINT organizations, in particular, made great contributions to this<br>operation:<br>Network Analysis Center (NAC - S31SD)<br>Counterterrorism Product Line (S2I)<br>Commercial Technologies (S3A)<br>Tailored Access Operations (S32)<br>Link Access Programs (S33)<br>KEYSCORE (R1, MHS)<br>CSG Baghdad<br>(TS//SI//REL) The CIA would like to pursue all opportunities to incorporate SIGINT -- in near<br>real-time -- into tactical HUMINT operations. The SIGINT information can be passed to teams on<br>the ground who are responsible for surveilling and capturing terrorists who use the internet,<br>thereby painting "as timely and accurate a picture of the virtual battleground" as possible.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
