DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) The 9/11 Commission Report -- Hot Off the Press!<br>FROM: the SID 9/11 Response Team<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 07/23/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) The National (9/11) Commission's long-awaited final report is on the streets! Building<br>on the work done by the Congressional Joint Intelligence Committee, the National Commission<br>staff reached out to the public and private sectors, gathering reams of documents, meeting with<br>scores of witnesses, and receiving many briefings to piece together its account of the events of<br>September 11, 2001. For the better part of a year, they spent countless hours analyzing, reanalyzing and compiling all of this information into a compelling report that recreates the<br>circumstances surrounding 9/11, highlights lessons learned (with the advantage of hindsight),<br>and recommends new measures to improve our national security. It goes without saying that<br>NSA cooperation was absolutely vital to this effort.<br>(S//SI) One of the Commission's biggest challenges was to produce a meaningful, unclassified<br>report for public consumption using a large body of material from classified sources. This was a<br>complex endeavor, because many of the Commission staffers, who were predominantly from<br>academia and law practices, had not come into contact with SIGINT before joining the staff. SID<br>supported the work of the Commission while protecting sensitive SIGINT equities.<br>(S//SI) Working with the Intelligence Community and NSA's Office of General Counsel and Office<br>of Policy, SID personnel examined over 500 pages of the draft report word-by-word in under a<br>month, identifying classified information and proposing alternative wording. The Agency was<br>only able to release many intelligence facts in the Commission report by disassociating them<br>from NSA or SIGINT. The final review process ended in face-to-face negotiations with the<br>Commission staff running up to the eleventh hour. As a result of this well-coordinated,<br>painstaking work, the publicly-released copy of the 9/11 Commission's final report is a wellwritten, complete story with few visible redactions and SID is satisfied that our information has<br>been well protected.<br>(C) The classification review process was only one example of our excellent cooperation with the<br>National Commission. With the support and oversight of DIRNSA, SID Leadership, and the Office<br>of General Counsel, employees at all levels of SID, in addition to folks in IAD and FAD , briefed<br>and interviewed with the Commission staff throughout the year, sometimes with as little as 24<br>hours notice. Time and time again, people rose to the occasion and patiently explained the<br>intricacies of their work, skillfully answering unanticipated questions. In addition to these many<br>interactions, NSA also turned over thousands of pages of requested documentation, including<br>SIGINT reports, activity logs, and policy documents, to name a few. Locating these documents<br>and preparing them for release to the Commission involved much hard work on the part of<br>employees throughout the Agency. The turnaround time was always outstanding.<br>(S//SI) You should all feel proud knowing that time you or your colleagues invested in explaining<br>our business to the National Commission staff members paid off. Throughout the process, the<br>Commission staff members were receptive and impressed with the level of expertise at NSA.<br>Many times the clarification provided by members of the SID workforce was essential to making<br>sure NSA was accurately represented to the public. We reiterate DIRNSA's encouragement (see<br>DIRgram-323 ) that you read the Commission's final report, keeping in mind ways to improve<br>the security of our nation. When you read it, know that SID was an important participant in this<br>national effort.<br>(S//SI) As a final reminder, when discussing the report with people who are not cleared, please<br>do not attribute any of the information back to NSA or SIGINT. Any congressional or media<br>inquiries about the report should be directed, without comment, to NSA's Legislative Affairs<br>Office or the Public Affairs Office , respectively. As noted above, we worked hard to disassociate<br>NSA from the final report. It is essential that we not inadvertently establish the link through<br><br> </p>comment to friends, family or others.
