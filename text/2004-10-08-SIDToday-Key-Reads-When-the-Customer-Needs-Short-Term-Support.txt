The Director of<br>Operations (J3) comes into your office with the Director of Intelligence (J2) and tells you about<br>operations planned for the upcoming week. The J2 wants to know what NSA is doing to support<br>these operations. You look at the Commander's Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) and<br>the customer's Information Needs (INs), which are comprehensive but wide-ranging, and realize<br>you need to tell NSA/CSS that the Command needs a certain production line or field element to<br>concentrate on specific essential elements of information (EEIs) this week to support the week's<br>operations plan.<br>(C) You decide to send these "Key Reads", back to NSA HQs. But who do you send them to? And<br>will all the analysts in the PLs and at RSOCs and field stations who may be able to support these<br>requirements actually see your email? If you are using SID's new on-line Key Reads process,<br>you know these information needs will be acted upon across the global NSA enterprise. This<br>example pertains to military operations but it is just as applicable to our integrated<br>representatives at the UN or Department of Commerce.<br>(C) Key Reads are aimed at implementing Goal 1 of the SID Placement to "Make the customer a<br>more active participant in steering the SIGINT system." Key Reads are defined as a<br>customer-driven information need tied to a specific, near-term (generally less than 72<br>hours) customer event, action, decision or outcome for which the customer expects a<br>cryptologic product or service. It is intended to sharply focus NSA global resources, and perhaps<br>for short periods of time possibly redirect efforts, to support the customer. It is not meant to<br>replace an existing IN.<br>(C) "Key Reads", in various forms and from various customers, have been around for some time.<br>But they aren't accounted for or tracked and may not even be reaching the appropriate elements<br>of the global enterprise. Building upon the Iraqi Key Reads experience, CRD Customer Gateway<br>has defined the business process and developed an online tool to enable us to expand Key<br>Reads to other customers and target areas. By taking this "corporate", we will ensure that<br>everyone has the knowledge to be in the customer's operational decision space.<br>(C) When a Key Read is entered into the tool, it immediately goes to production centers for<br>action. The production center, no matter where it is in the extended enterprise, will be able to<br>review their production queue daily and adjust, if necessary, to focus production on this most<br>important customer need. At the same time, the Key Read is sent to the Requirements Analysis<br>Center (S16) to map the Key Read to an existing IN/EEI, or if one doesn't exist, notify the<br>submitter that NSA has the Key Read for action, but ask the customer to submit an IN through<br>National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) to document the requirement. The RAC will also<br>work closely with S2 to produce metrics that measure NSA's agility in responding to the<br>customers' information needs.<br>(C) An IPT** with cross-organizational and field representation has been established, led by<br>S11 Customer Gateway, to implement the process across our 50 customers. This<br>team will work issues such as Second Party participation, measuring the agility of SIGINT<br>products and services against Key Reads, determining whether quick reaction collection<br>strategies are needed, and linking Key Reads to the NSRP. We hope to have all customers<br>integrated into the process by Spring 2005 -- one step in building the single, integrated, global,<br>self-aware, self-synchronizing global enterprise.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, contact <br><br> (<br><br>).<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">**(U) Notes: <br>IPT = Integrated Process Team <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
