Results and Expected Performance: In FY 2011, the FY 2011 target was not met due to decommissioning ofVoiceRT systems
deployed outside NSA-Washington. The decommissioning was in preparation for deployment of a more robust voice analytic system
in FY 2012. Processing volumes fluctuated during FY 2011. By FY 2013, NSA/CSS expects to have operationalized a more robust
voice processing capability based on speech-to-text keyword search and paired dialogue transcription._____________

Results and Expected Performance: In FY 2011, the voice analytic system at NSA/CSS Washington (NSAW) processed 345,000
voice cuts. This growth in machine translation (MT) services utilization resulted in greater than expected analytic efficiency. Due to
higher than expected analytic efficiency from the growth in MT services utilization, NSA/CSS is adopting more ambitious future
targets for this measure. In FY 2013, more robust voice analytic and machine translation systems will be in operation across the
SIGINT enterprise, analyzing greater volumes of data at higher speeds. Productivity increases will further lower the analytic hour
equivalent cost.

Results and Expected Performance: The FY 2011 target was not achieved because a major deployment was rescheduled for late
CY 2011 due to a decision to move the system into a government-leased facility as well as a system change that required additional
engineering. NSA/CSS expects to complete the deployment of its content storage capacity in FY 2012 allowing NSA/CSS to
establish its operational content storage baseline for analyst use. Therefore, this measure will be discontinued, effective FY 2013.

Results and Expected Performance: The target was not met due to an unexpected rale of analyst attrition toward the end of FY
2011. While NSA/CSS fell short of its target, the number of analysts who received DNI core training increased by 500 each quarter.
In FY 2013, NSA/CSS will continue to identify DNI core training gaps and address them with more DNI-specific development
plans. This will ensure NSA/CSS analysts are capable of meeting evolving mission needs._________________________

Results: In FY 2011, the target was not met due to the high operations tempo, which resulted in mission personnel being unavailable
to attend scheduled training classes. This measure is discontinued effective FY 2012 and replaced by a new measure, AP 00030.
