Let's look at these shortages a little more closely. Four-fifths of the<br>entire cryptologic language workforce is military . Currently, only 25% of them are at the<br>operational standard (level 3/3) in the languages they are working; only 51% of the civilians are<br>3/3. This is the primary cause of the severe language deficiency. (This was caused by a number<br>of factors, such as the downsizing of the military and civilian cadres over the last 10 years, high<br>turnover rates, etc.)<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS has drawn up a comprehensive, long-term plan -- worked jointly by all<br>cryptologic military and civilian sectors -- to remedy the situation, as described below:<br>(U//FOUO) Life-cycle learning/enhancement throughout career. Training must be<br>continuous and sustained, even beyond level 3.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA Action to Date: The Language Analysis Professional Health Program<br>(PHP) aims to transform military and civilian linguists into language analysts through a<br>concentrated program that develops language proficiency, performance skills, and<br>congruity judgment for cryptologic language work. "Congruity judgment" is the crucial<br>ability to fit an English product to the content and context of the original, critical to the<br>intelligence process. It goes far beyond a superficial word-for-word, machine-like<br>substitution of English words for target-language ones.<br>(U//FOUO) The National Cryptologic School (NCS) handles the job of teaching languages<br>at NSA/CSS. NSA/CSS has also sponsored the addition of Defense Language Institute<br>(DLI) "language training detachments" at NSA Fort Meade and all three NSA/CSS<br>Regional Security Operating Centers (RSOCs); these teachers provide high-quality<br>training at the very sites where the language analysts are working. Finally, new<br>Accelerated Cryptologic Language Programs are in place and operational at two of the<br>three RSOCs, with the third to come on-line in early FY2005. These programs blend<br>upper-level cryptologic and global language.<br>(S) NSA/CSS has programmed a total of $395 million for the years FY05-09 specifically to<br>address higher-level (beyond level 2) training for military and civilian language analysts<br>throughout their careers and around the world.<br>(U//FOUO) Systemic adjustments in career management . Cryptologic language analysts<br>must be assigned to language work in order to minimize the decaying of their language skills. In<br>a study performed by the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority (SLA), the number one reason<br>for military language analysts leaving the career field or service was the fact that they were not<br>assigned to language work.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA Action to Date: NSA/CSS began reorganizing the management of its<br>language cadre into a single component to enable maximum flexibility and agility and<br>optimal fit of language competence to mission need. Deployment Services (S214) is the<br>first big step. It manages the deployment of language analysts throughout S2 , based on<br>mission requirements and priorities.<br>(U//FOUO) Comprehensive modernization of the Defense Language Institute/Foreign<br>Language Center (DLI/FLC) in Monterey, California. While there are some excellent language<br>programs in existence at universities and colleges across America, DLI is responsible for<br>language training for all military. It is the model for general language training in terms of<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">methodology and approach, incorporating a learner-centered, task-based curriculum from the<br>first day of class. In this decade, over 98% of DLI's training has been devoted to the basic level,<br>the outcome of which is a level 2/2. There is virtually no existing curriculum in any language at<br>DLI above Level 2/2. In order to provide training to the 3/3 level (NSA/CSS's operational<br>standard), DLI will thus have to substantially increase its resident and extended programs.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Action to Date: NSA/CSS personnel collaborated with DLI experts<br>and then coordinated with the US Army's Training and Doctrine Command, the Army's<br>Executive Agent for DLI, on "what it would take" for DLI to offer upper level courses and<br>curricula. Through DoD's Joint Requirements Oversight Council process, NSA/CSS has<br>championed increased funding required for DLI to support the 3/3 requirement.<br>Additionally, NSA/CSS sponsored three pilot Proficiency Enhancement Programs in Arabic<br>in 2003. All three pilots proved conclusively that 12 additional weeks of training at DLI to<br>high aptitude, high potential, level 2/2+ military language analysts resulted in at least a<br>plus point increase in proficiency, plus additional skills in Iraqi.<br>(U//FOUO) Higher level language and advanced cryptologic skills curriculum<br>development. While 3/3 is the operational standard, 3/3 language proficiency alone is not<br>sufficient to handle the SIGINT factors regularly encountered by the CLA. The NCS, as<br>Responsible Training Authority for intermediate and advanced cryptologic language training, has<br>for years led the Intelligence Community and DoD in providing upper level work-related and jobspecific language training. NCS will work with the Language Analysis Skill Community, DLI and<br>the Services to ensure that 3/3-level CLA have not only the required general language<br>proficiency, but the SIGINT language skills as well.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Actions to Date: Over the past three years alone, NSA/CSS has<br>given almost $10 million to DLI for training expansion and test development. At the same<br>time, the NCS continues to increase the cryptologic focus throughout its curricula in<br>order to more effectively reflect job requirements. Finally, General Quirk has declared<br>that language training is mandatory for all civilian and military CLAs.<br>(U) Watch for the conclusion of this series next!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
