• Example: If we have a site named “US-123”
connecting to xks-central over a 1 Mbps link,
US-123’s config would be:

bandwidth[world] = 1Mbps

peer[00] = address=xks-central.corp.nsa.ic.gov, port=2412,
bandwidth=world, network=external

And xks-central would have:
bandwidth[us123] = 1Mbps

allow[00] = address=xkey-master.us123, bandwidth=us123,
network=internal
