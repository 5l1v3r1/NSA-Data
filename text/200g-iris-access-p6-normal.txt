SSE Roadmap / Future Capability

Supporting Internet Operations

•	The SSE Roadmap is still valid though needs re-visiting to
update/valldate the recommended intercept and egress
expansion.

•	Along with TEA and SRT (and ECB) we are developing
new relationships to expand our access footprint, to bring
the number of 10G bearers:

-	Intercepted by Mar 2011 to: 1513 (or there abouts...)

(+70 if we include CIRCUIT/WG)

-	Egressed to GCHQ processing systems by Mar 2011 to: 415

Eagle eyed will have noticed that this doesn't align with the
projected processing and storage profile.
