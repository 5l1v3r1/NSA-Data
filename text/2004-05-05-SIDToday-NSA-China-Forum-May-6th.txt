This is the fourth installment of an ongoing series that is<br>meant to not only inform the workforce about issues involving China, but overall greater East<br>Asian security challenges. This month's NSA China Forum is entitled "Northeast Asian Security:<br>Moving Toward A Regional Security Framework?"<br>(U) Dr. Kurt Campbell, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies<br>International Security Program, will lead the unclassified discussion. Professor Robert Sutter of<br>Georgetown University and Dr. Kongdan Oh of the Institute for Defense Analyses will also<br>provide presentations on this increasingly important issue.<br>(U) We have requested that the speakers consider the following questions when formulating<br>their presentations:<br>1.  Has the Six-Party Talks process set the stage for the emergence of an East Asian<br>multilateral security framework?<br>2.  Has participation in the Six-Party Talks facilitated the amelioration of ties between Japan<br>and China? If so, will the improvement last?<br>3.  Is the emergence of a regional security organization in Washington's interest?<br>4.  What role would North Korea play in a post-Six-Party Talks regional security architecture?<br>Is it possible for Pyongyang to play a role other than target?<br>5.  If a regional security arrangement is established in the wake of the North Korean nuclear<br>issue, will it be possible to include cross-Strait relations as an issue for discussion within<br>that framework?<br>(U//FOUO) For additional information, feel free to contact us:<br>Michael Vance <br>A/SIGINT NIO for East Asia <br>(s)<br> <br>PRC Foreign Affairs <br>Foreign Policy Analyst <br>(s)<br> <br>PRC Foreign Affairs <br>Intelligence Analyst <br>(b) <br> (s) <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
