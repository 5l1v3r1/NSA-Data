(S//SI//REL) Persistence Operational Scenario

»

(TS//SI//REL) FEEDTROUGH can be used to persist two implants, ZESTYLEAK and/or
BANANAGLEE across reboots and software upgrades on known and covered OS’s for the
following Netscreen firewalls, ns5xt, ns25, ns50, ns200, ns500 and ISG 1000. There is no
direct communication to or from FEEDTROUGH, but if present, the BANANAGLEE implant
can receive and transmit covert channel comms, and for certain platforms, BANANAGLEE
can also update FEEDTROUGH. FEEDTROUGH however can only persist OS’s included
in it’s databases. Therefore this is best employed with known OS’s and if a new OS comes
out. then the customer would need to add this OS to the FEEDTROUGH database for that
particular firewall.

(TS//SI//REL) FEEDTROUGH operates every time the particular Juniper firewall boots. The
first hook takes it to the code which checks to see if the OS is in the database, if it is, then a
chain of events ensures the installation of either one or both implants. Otherwise the firewall
boots normally. If the OS is one modified by DNT, it is not recognized, which gives the
customer freedom to field new software.

Status: (S//SI//REL) FEEDTROUGH has on the shelf solutions for all of the listed platforms.
It has been deployed on many target platforms
