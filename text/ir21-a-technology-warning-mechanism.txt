What role does enabling, cooperative access, HUMINT, 2nd parties, etc. play in
building those capabilities?

   

(U) Two Types of Investigations

(5mm Horizon Scanning
Objective: Initial identification and assessment
All source research

Answer the question: Does this technology appear to be a large risk
to the SIGINT system? Why or why not?

USA, FVEY) Deep Dive
Objective: Cause a funding decision(s)

All source research; emphasis on geographic uptake trends;target
uptake plans or vignettes.

Answer the questionzAre SIGINT targets taking up this technology?
How fast?

Implicitly contrast the above with the cost and time needed to
remediate any SIGINT system shortfalls.

?3 (U) Trends and Forecasts: A
Geo?temporal Tracking Problem

   

(U) Forecast:
?An estimation of a Future Condition? 

?To calculate or predict some future event or condition usually
as a result of the analysis of available pertinent data? Merriam Webster

(U) Trend:
?To extend in a general direction; follow a general course?

- Merriam Webster

(U) By necessity, a trend-line requires measurement of
understood variables across time.

   

(U) Roaming Agreements

(U) Allow a mobile subscriber to use resources on a visited
network

Each carrier?s IR.2I is a technical document that:

Describes the operator itself in various ways

Location, business codes, etc.

Describes access to the IP network of the operator
DNS, lP addresses,ASN, etc.

Describes:
Radio Access Network: technology(ies) type(s)
Frequency(ies)
Telephony routing information (MSISDN ranges; 
SCCP gateways (Point codes)
MobileApplication Part protocol in use
Hardware, software versions of certain network 

(memo USA, va HypothesiszWe can identify and track a carrier?s
technical evolution with IR.2I and other data.

?Releases? Clear Technology Roadmap
3G begins with Release 99
Other releases(future)

See:

Releases cover:
m: GSM, EDGE, HSPA, LTE, LTE-Advanced, etc.
m: GSM Core, Enhanced Packet 

Services: MS, etc.  .

 

Defines carrier information exchange required
to enable roaming

Changes to IR.2I format warn of imminent technology roll-out

An IR.2I is a GSMA-mandated document. IR.2I are exchanged between Wireless
operators with roaming agreements, to the GSMA, and to certain clearing house
operations.

(U) Analytic Process

   

(memo Data analysis process is to match information in
IR.2 I or elsewhere, against Releases in the Technology
Roadmap

Example: CAMEL Phase 4 (aka CAMEL4) as proxy for Release 5 deployment

USA, FVEY) Analytic goals:
Establish a date-time for a release deployment
Track releases at the per network level
Display status at the national, regional, hemispheric or global scale
Measure speed of adoption at each scale

Identify early and late adopter tendencies by network

USA, FVEY) Deliverables:
Adoption trends over time
Forecasts derived from trends and framework changes

Formal reporting of data and conclusions as a dataset
