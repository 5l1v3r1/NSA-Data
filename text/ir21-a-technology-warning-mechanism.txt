produce for which customers

Capabilities

What geographies are of national interest to our
customers?

What organizations and individuals must we
target to answer our customers' questions?

How does those targets communicate?

Vulnerabilities

What capabilities do we need to develop to take advantage of technology
vulnerabilities?

What techniques to do we deploy to take advantage of those vulnerabilities (e.g.
CNE, supply chain, mid-point, etc.)

What role does enabling, cooperative access, HUMINT, 2nd parties, etc. play in
building those capabilities?

How is technology evolving?
How are technology and
telecoms evolving in regions of
interest?

How do we expect targets to
use emerging technologies?
What is the SIGINT threat of
these emerging technologies?

What vulnerabilities are critical to
current success (i.e. where are our
risk areas)?

How do we discover vulnerabilities?
How do we introduce vulnerabilities
where they do not yet exist?

(u)Two Types of Investigations

►	(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Horizon Scanning

►	Objective: Initial identification and assessment

►	All source research

►	Answer the question: Does this technology appear to be a large risk
to the SIGINT system? Why or why not?

►	(s//relto usa, fvey) Deep Dive

►	Objective: Cause a funding decision(s)

►	All source research; emphasis on geographic uptake trends; target
uptake plans or vignettes.

►	Answer the question: Are SIGINT targets taking up this technology?
How fast?

►	Implicitly contrast the above with the cost and time needed to
remediate any SIGINT system shortfalls.

(U) Trends and Forecasts: A
Geo-temporal Tracking Problem

► (U) Forecast:

►	“An estimation of a Future Condition” ...

►	“To calculate or predict some future event or condition usually
as a result of the analysis of available pertinent data”

► (U) Trend:

► “To extend in a general direction; follow a general course”

-Merriam Webster

► (U) By necessity, a trend-line requires measurement of
understood variables across time.

►

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

(U) Roaming Agreements

►	(U) Allow a mobile subscriber to use resources on a visited

network

► Each carrier's IR.21 is a technical document that:

►	Describes the operator itself in various ways

□	Location, business codes, etc.

►	Describes access to the IP network of the operator

□	DNS, IP addresses, ASN, etc.

►	Describes:

□	Radio Access Network: technology(ies) type(s)

□	Frequency(ies)

□	Telephony routing information (MSISDN ranges; E.212)

□	SCCP gateways (Point codes)

□	Mobile Application Part protocol in use

□	Hardware, software versions of certain network elements...

► (s//relto usa, fvey) Hypothesis: We can identify and track a carrier's
technical evolution with IR.21 and other data.

(U) And What About 4G?

►	(U) IMT-adv is an ITU led effort to set requirements for next gen. mobile

networks

► Just as ITU’s IMT-2000 defined 3G, ITU’s IMT-adv will define 4G

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

(U) Framework for Analysis...

►

►

(U)3GPP: Defines technology migration paths.

► “Releases” - A Clear Technology Roadmap

□	3G begins with Release 99

□	Other releases: 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, .... 10, 11 (future)

See: www.3gpp.org/ftp/Information/WORK_PLAN/Description_Releases/

□	Releases cover:

□	Access: GSM, EDGE, HSPA, LTE, LTE-Advanced, etc.

□	Core: GSM Core, Enhanced Packet Core.

□	Services: MS, etc.

(U)GSMA: Defines carrier information exchange required
to enable roaming

□	Changes to IR.21 format warn of imminent technology roll-out

□	An IR.21 is a GSMA-mandated document. IR.21 are exchanged between Wireless
operators with roaming agreements, to the GSMA, and to certain clearing house
operations.

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

(U) Analytic Process

► (s//rel to usa, fvey) Data analysis process is to match information in
IR.21, or elsewhere, against Releases in the Technology
Roadmap

□ Example: CAMEL Phase 4 (aka CAMEL4) as proxy for Release 5 deployment

►	(s//rel to usa, fvey) Analytic goals:

►	Establish a date-time for a release deployment

►	Track releases at the per network level

►	Display status at the national, regional, hemispheric or global scale

►	Measure speed of adoption at each scale

►	Identify early and late adopter tendencies by network

►	(s//relto usa, fvey) Deliverables:

►	Adoption trends over time

___► Forecasts derived from trends and framework changes

^	► Formal reporting of data and conclusions!-, as a dataset
