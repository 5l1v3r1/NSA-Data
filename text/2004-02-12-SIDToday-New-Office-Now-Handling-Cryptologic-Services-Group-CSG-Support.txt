As part of transforming Customer<br>Relationships, Customer Gateway assumed responsibility for providing support to the<br>Cryptologic Services Groups (CSGs) in October 2003.<br>(U//FOUO) This shift in responsibility from the previous mission element, Military Integration<br>Office (S13), will now allow the Military Integration Office to focus all its energy on providing<br>support to crisis operations and exercise planning. This move, moreover, reflected a logical realignment of our most forward customer support organizations (CSGs) with the customer<br>Account Manager (AM) and Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) programs which also<br>reside in Customer Gateway.<br>(U//FOUO) A new CSG and Customer Visits Support branch within Customer Gateway has been<br>established to provide direct support to the CSGs. Critical functions include IT support (including<br>the management of Sun to NT migration), responsibility for CSG personnel management and<br>training, and planning and executing the worldwide CSG conference. Military Integration's<br>Military Support Officers (MSOs) will continue to provide planning and operational support to the<br>CSGs and will continue to recruit, train, deploy, and support personnel deployed to the forward<br>operational areas. In addition, Military Integration will remain the lead organization for National<br>Intelligence Support Team (NIST) support as well as support for those "CSGs" that have evolved<br>from NISTs or other NSA support to crisis operations. For USCENTCOM's area of responsibility<br>(AOR), for example, this means that the manning, logistical and planning support for NSA<br>personnel at Bagram, Kabul, Baghdad and Horn of Africa (HOA) will continue to be supported by<br>Military Integration.<br>(U//FOUO) The successes of the transition to date include:<br>Planning has begun for the first Worldwide CSG conference in several years, which will be<br>held at NSAW Headquarters on May 12-14, 2004.<br>A new three-year plan to upgrade the CSG IT desktop systems is in place. One third (13<br>locations) of the CSGs will be upgraded (and converted from SUN to NT at most CSGs) in<br>each of the next three years. This represents the first upgrades to the CSG architecture<br>in several years. The plan has been funded and implemented - CSG Pentagon was<br>successfully upgraded in December 2003.<br>FY04 CSG requirements for travel, equipment and supplies have been collected and<br>totaled. Funding has been identified to fulfill a large majority of the these needs; current<br>year is above average with respect to funding due to supplemental funding to support<br>OIF. A "working allocation" has been determined for each CSG that the NCR/ CSG Chief<br>can manage.<br>A needs assessment for training has been conducted and, in conjunction with the<br>National Cryptologic School, we have begun coordinating a baseline training plan for all<br>CSG personnel.<br>(U//FOUO) The CSG and Customer Visits Support Staff is located in OPS 2A, Room 2A0614. The<br>newly appointed branch chief is Mr. <br>. This staff's most immediate tasks include:<br>reviewing billets and funding required to support the CSGs in order to identify and rectify the<br>most pressing manning issues and shortfalls; planning and implementing an enhanced training<br>program for newly assigned CSG personnel; and identifying responsibilities that reside within<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">other SID organizations.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information, contact Col Keith Pavlischek, USMC, Military Affairs Special<br>Assistant, Customer Gateway (S11),<br>@nsa, <br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
