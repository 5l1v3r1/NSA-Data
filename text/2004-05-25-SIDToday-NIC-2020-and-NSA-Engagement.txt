The 2020 effort is a follow-on<br>study to the NIC's Global Trends 2015 project that identified 7 key drivers. These drivers are:<br>Demographics, Natural Resources and the Environment, Science and Technology, Global<br>Economy and Globalization, National and International Governance, Future Conflict, and the Role<br>of the US. A new driver has been added for the 2020 study-- Social Identity.<br>(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council, in cooperation with the Strategic Planning Office and Toffler<br>Associates, is currently engaging the NSA Community in support of the NIC 2020 project in the<br>following ways:<br>(U) IAI ESSAY CONTEST<br>(U//FOUO) THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS INSTITUTE has announced its annual essay contest.<br>This year's contest is unique in that the IAI has chosen a subject that is relevant to the National<br>Intelligence Council's (NIC) 2020 project.<br>(U//FOUO) The IAI invites you to draft an UNCLASSIFIED essay that depicts a plausible global<br>scenario out to the year 2020. In addition to monetary prizes, IAI essay entries may be used in<br>NIC discussions and publications as well as in internal NSA discussions on strategic planning and<br>input to the NIC project. The NIC 2020 publication will be aimed at policymakers, but will also be<br>read and used widely in the global intelligence and academic communities.<br>(U) Please go to the IAI website for additional details and contest rules.<br>(U) NSA OUTREACH SESSIONS<br>(U) As a vital component of NSA's participation in the NIC2020 project, the SINIO Council -- in<br>partnership with SIGINT Planning and Toffler Associates -- is building its own scenarios for<br>presentation to the NIC. You too are invited to participate! How? By joining one of our NIC2020<br>Outreach Sessions. We are seeking to bring in viewpoints from across the Agency, and the<br>information garnered will be used to both test and strengthen the SINIOs' scenario-building<br>exercise. All we ask for is two hours of your time for a session with a Toffler Associates<br>facilitator. You and the other members of your group will be asked a series of questions that will<br>get you thinking about the future in new and different ways. The sessions are designed to be an<br>enjoyable learning experience, and the proceedings even include free food and a door prize!<br>(U) The outreach sessions will be held throughout May and June. If you would like to participate,<br>please contact Brenda Martineau (<br>) or <br>) and they will get you in<br>contact with the appropriate Outreach Session leader.

The thought leaders will also be asked to consider and<br>discuss boarder implications of technology on the world in 2020. Results from the session will<br>contribute to the development of a technology report in support of the National Intelligence<br>Council and will drive strategic planning for national-level decision-makers.<br>(U//FOUO) Following up what is developed in this unclassified event, SID will then engage NSA's<br>Technology Panel, an advisory panel consisting of leaders in the private sector, in a classified<br>discussion of potential futures.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
