DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Introducing SGM<br>FROM: SGM<br>SID SEA<br>Run Date: 01/06/2004<br>FROM: SGM <br>SID SEA <br><br> SID's New Senior Enlisted Advisor<br>, USA<br><br> USA <br><br>(U) As a new team member within the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), I have been asked<br>to share my thoughts on my role as the new SID Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA), give insight as<br>to how I operate, and share the goals I would like to achieve.<br>(U) The role of any SEA is to advise his/her senior leader on military enlisted issues. The role of<br>SID SEA is to advise the SIGINT Director on all military enlisted matters within SID. In simple<br>terms, all SEA's/NCO's/leaders within NSA have an inherent role of taking care of enlisted<br>personnel. I am here to ensure they stay true to that role. I look forward to working with every<br>member of the SIGINT team, both military and civilian.<br>(U) My primary goal is to carry out NSA's mission efficiently, and to care for our most valued<br>resource: people. I would like to focus on a training program that supports mission requirements<br>and continues with career progression, while giving both the military and civilian personnel<br>insight and understanding regarding the important roles they play in both the SIGINT mission<br>and the Intelligence Community.<br>(U) Integrity is not just an Army Value; it's a ways of life. Being up front...calling it as you see<br>it, are both very important to me. I believe in handling problems at the lowest level. At the<br>same time, I don't believe problems get better with age, so see your SER/SEA for assistance. I<br>may come across on the rough side, but I won't stop until we get the right answer. I am new to<br>NSA, but not the SIGINT field. Please stop by and bring any good ideas with you. I am here to<br>learn as well, and in my 27 years I have found that there is more than one way to do things.<br>(U) In addition to my goals, I would also like to convey my expectations of those assigned to<br>SID. Followers expect leaders to show them the standard and train them to reach it. They expect<br>leaders to lead by example. Additionally, they expect leaders to keep them informed and to care<br>for them. Leaders may have to ask others to make extraordinary sacrifices to achieve goals.<br>Leaders may have to call on them to do things that seem impossible. If leaders have trained<br>their people to standard, inspired their willingness, and consistently looked after their interests,<br>they will be prepared to accomplish any goal, anytime, anywhere.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
