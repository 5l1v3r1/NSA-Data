Committee on Civil Liberties,

Justice and Home Affairs

Dear Mr. López Aguilar:

In response to your invitation to participate in the LIBE Committee’s hearings on
alleged NSA programs, I regret that I cannot attend. As you know, the U.S., EU, and EU
member states are engaged in an ad hoc working group to discuss certain intelligence
oversight activities. The working group has already met three times. We believe the
working group is the appropriate channel for these discussions and look forward to
continuing the constructive dialogue already underway there. We greatly appreciate our
cooperation with the EU and want to reinforce the strong U.S. and EU partnership. The
United States Government recognizes and appreciates the important role that the
European Parliament plays in this relationship, and my colleagues and 1 always welcome
the opportunity to engage with Members and the Parliamentary leadership in appropriate
venues.

General, U.S. Army
Director, NSA
