Approximately 20% of the NSA workforce<br>contributed to the campaign and, while the final tally won't be completed until after the new<br>year, it looks like NSA contributions will exceed $1.7 million.<br>(U) The statistics (see the report ) for SID are just as impressive. SID surpassed its goal for the<br>campaign with 108% and an overall participation rate of sixteen percent. Since all the<br>contributions from SID have not yet been tallied, we expect our contribution rate to increase as<br>well. All contributors, canvassers, keyworkers and coordinators can feel proud to have taken<br>part in this activity as it will benefit many people long after the holidays are over. My thanks to<br>each of you for taking on this additional responsibility.<br>(U) I'd also like to congratulate SID employee <br> from S2. One of the CFC activities<br>was to guess the number of candies inside a huge glass jar. Without even seeing the jar (he only<br>viewed it on the web),<br> guessed the exact amount of candy inside -- 1266. Well done<br>(U) Remember, it is not too late to be a part of the giving. Even though the official campaign is<br>over, donations and contributions are still being accepted until 31 December. If you have any<br>questions or you would still like to contribute, contact<br> on either <br> or<br>.<br>(U) Thanks again for all your efforts and have a great holiday season.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
