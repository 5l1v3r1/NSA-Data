She<br>contacted the staff of the Geographic Resource Center (GRC) who found, created and posted<br>online a series of maps focusing on Greece, ranging from tourist to maritime to transportation.<br>The analyst -- together with the entire field site staff -- was then able to tap into the GRC's<br>website collection directly from Athens.<br>(S//SI) "The maps provided by the GRC on Netscape made it extremely easy for us to quickly<br>check locations of incidents that were happening real-time without having to log into a<br>cumbersome tool like ArcView," recounted the analyst after returning from Athens. "In addition,<br>the hard-copy road maps and books were lifesavers. We repeatedly heard references to certain<br>streets in Athens, many of which have the same name. The road map books allowed us to<br>quickly narrow down the possibilities of where an incident was occurring."<br>(S) Many analysts visit the GRC in person so they can talk with staff about the kind of map they<br>want and what they want it for. GRC analysts know what questions to ask and where to draw<br>from the vast resources, whether for a planning map for the wall, a tourist map of Kabul, data<br>for an ArcView project, or the pinpointing of a target. Most often, a single quick visit solves a<br>simple problem. Sometimes the problems are harder.<br>(S//SI) Earlier this year, Pakistan military analysts following Pakistani troop movements were<br>frustrated by the Pakistanis' use of a coordinate system that didn't match up with any current<br>maps. GRC researchers found old copies of Pakistan topographic maps produced by the British in<br>the 1940s -- which turned out to have nearly the same grid system used by the Pakistanis. After<br>scanning and printing the maps, the NGA (National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, formerly<br>NIMA) liaison then transferred the images to a CD for use by the analysts at their desktops.<br>(S//SI) "The maps dug out by the GRC researchers were used to locate many small villages not<br>in the gazetteer, which in turn helped us track the reported locations of various terrorist high<br>value targets," said<br>, an analyst involved in the project. "We also were able to update<br>and formulate the Pakistani military's order of battle and force disposition for the area."<br>(U//FOUO) If you are in the Extended Enterprise or unable to visit the GRC in person, the<br>recently reorganized and redesigned GEOLIB website is worth an online stroll. Under the<br>SEARCH tab, maps and data are organized by country. Maps for Power Point presentations -- or<br>for putting a target quickly in context -- can easily be found by clicking on a thumbprint image<br>on GEOLIB.<br>(U//FOUO) Geographic reference information is easier to find, too, on GEOLIB. Anyone<br>wondering about whether large-scale maps provide detail -- or is it small-scale? -- or searching<br>for the right kind of digital data will find a couple of quick-reference pages on the site. Online<br>primers with the most basic map information and descriptions of different kinds of digital data<br>like CADRG (Compressed ARC Digitized Raster Graphics) are a good place to start when looking<br>for the best answers to mapping questions.<br>(U//FOUO)<br> is the team chief of the Geographic Resource Center, which is<br>located in OPS1, Room 2S077.
