(S//SI//REL) NSA Liaison in Tokyo Opens New Office

FROM: 

SUSLAJ Chief of Staff
Run Date: 10/23/2007

(S//SI//REL) The Special US Liaison Advisor Japan's (SUSLAJ) cover office in downtown Tokyo was
officially closed this month. Formerly known as the 5th Air Force Technical Liaison Office, located at
Hardy Barracks, it had been the center of gravity in managing NSA's longstanding SIGINT relationship
with the Government of Japan. NSA and Japan's Directorate for SIGINT (DFS) have had a SIGINT
relationship whose origin dates back to the 1950s.

(S//SI//REL) In order to take NSA's relationship with Japan to the next level, SUSLAJ has opened a brand
new satellite office inside the US Embassy in Tokyo and moved significant operational components of the
Third Party mission with DFS to SUSLAJ's main facilities on Yokota Air Base (28 miles northwest of
Tokyo). This new office in the Embassy (known as SUSLAJ-Tokyo) will allow NSA to improve its ability
to coordinate with the US Ambassador and US Intelligence Community representatives on bilateral
intelligence activities conducted with Japan and to ensure the Embassy is receiving the first class SIGINT
support it needs.

(S//SI//REL) SUSLAJ closed the cover office at Hardy Barracks due to force-protection issues with the
location of the facility, a determination that cover operations are no longer required, and an effort to
establish closer collaboration with other US Intelligence Community representatives in Tokyo.

(S//SI//REL) NSA's partnership with Japan continues to grow in importance along with the overall US
Government's renewed emphasis on its strategic alliance with Japan. The 2005 signing of the Security
Consultative Committee Document by the US Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and their
Japanese counterparts set forth a policy, and follow-on initiatives, to establish common strategic
objectives, review roles and missions and capabilities, and the realignment of forces for an enduring US
presence in Japan. NSA and Intelligence Community have a significant role in supporting these initiatives
by ensuring the enhancement of information sharing and intelligence cooperation between the US and
Japan is accomplished and that Japan is taken to the next level as an intelligence partner with the US.

(UHFOUO) Note: NSA's presence in the US Embassy in Tokyo is not classified. However, the fact of this
presence is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and the office goes by the name "DoD Special Representative
Japan-Tokyo" in unclassified channels.
