I spent the<br>first three months with Customer Account Management (S112) as a representative to the FBI's<br>Washington Field Office (WFO). During the second half of my tour I have been a forwarddeployed SIGDEV analyst from the Counterterrorism product line, detailed to the<br>Communications Analysis Unit (CAU) at FBI headquarters. Each of these positions has allowed<br>me to gain a big-picture understanding of the link (and, since 9/11, sometimes the blurry line)<br>between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement. I was also able to experience firsthand the successes brought about by this relationship as well as the challenges inherent in it.<br>(U//FOUO) As we have all heard many times during the 9/11 Commission hearings, the FBI has<br>traditionally been and continues to be very good at investigating incidents after they have<br>occurred. However, their current challenge in the post-9/11 world is to improve their ability to<br>perform predictive and preventative analysis. They have made great strides toward this end by<br>devoting more resources to hiring and retaining qualified analysts and improving information<br>exchange with Intelligence Community partners. But, at least in my experience, there is more<br>that can be done. I think this point is illustrated well in the following example:<br>(C) I had been at WFO for about a month when I met an agent who had just returned from a 90day tour in Iraq where he was responsible for investigating attacks on coalition forces. He began<br>to list the names of several detainees he had interviewed during the course of his duties, and<br>explained that he often had little or no background information about these individuals before<br>going to speak to them. He was sometimes even forced to recommend that they be released<br>because he had no means of vetting their story. I remembered one of the names from my own<br>tour in Iraq one year earlier, and decided to do a brief search of NSA databases and Intelink<br>resources. I discovered that the individual I remembered was indeed the same person who had<br>been interviewed by the FBI.<br>(C) NSA's counterterrorism product line had issued dozens of product reports about him and his<br>extremist associates during the combat operations phase of OIF. All of these reports were<br>addressed to both FBI HQ and FBI WFO, but this valuable information never made it to the case<br>agent who was cleared to see it and could actually act on it. This experience was eye-opening for<br>me and further underscored the importance of being able to freely share information between<br>agencies. 9/11 has forced policy changes that are helping to make that happen at an<br>unprecedented rate. But it seems to me that education and infrastructure still remain as the two<br>main roadblocks to this effort. I will attempt to briefly address each of these in a little more<br>detail in part 2 of this article.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
