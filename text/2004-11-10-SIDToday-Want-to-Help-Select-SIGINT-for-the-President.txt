DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S) Want to Help Select SIGINT for the President?<br>FROM: <br>Chief, Cryptologic Services Group, CIA (F52)<br>Run Date: 11/10/2004<br><br>(S) Are you interested in being on the front line for selecting SIGINT to brief the President, his<br>Cabinet, and Intelligence Community officials? If so, then do two things. First, check the field<br>vacancy announcements on Monday to learn about current job openings at CSG CIA. Then, plan<br>to attend a brown-bag session on Tuesday, 16 November from 1200-1300 in 2N007.<br>During that session, I will provide more information and answer your questions about<br>assignment at CSG CIA.<br>(S) Working as NSA's representative in the DCI Operations Center (where the CSG is located) is<br>definitely interesting. Just two weeks ago, I briefed the newly-appointed DCI on how the<br>Intelligence Community's CRITIC program works (following some excellent GRSOC* CRITIC<br>reporting). During that exchange of information, Mr. Goss asked me, "Does the President have<br>this information?" After assuring him that the President was informed, I thought to myself:<br>"Wow...this is definitely work supporting the very top of the government!"<br>(S) Our big responsibility here in the CSG is to support the Presidential briefers. We select the<br>SIGINT each day that meets their reporting thresholds for briefing their principals. We have an<br>intimate, constructive relationship with the briefers, and they make us proud each day by telling<br>us that SIGINT is often the best intelligence that is shown to the President -- at home or on the<br>road -- as well as to the Secretary of Defense, State, the National Security Advisor, and other<br>Cabinet-level officials. We also brief senior DCI officials, to include the A/DCI for Collection, the<br>National Intelligence Council Chairman, and officials from CIA's Office of Collection Strategies<br>and Analysis.<br>(U//FOUO) CIA also has some very interesting people that come through the Operations Center.<br>In just the last month, baseball star Cal Ripken Jr. and movie celebrity Robert DeNiro were both<br>here -- at our desk -- receiving an unclassified view of how the DCI directs Intelligence<br>Community operations.<br>(U) At the end of the day, however, the real benefit to being part of the CSG CIA is knowing<br>that you are on the intel front line -- and that's incredibly rewarding. Please review the vacancy<br>announcements, and I'll see you at the brown bag on Tuesday!<br><br>(U) Kryptos sculpture in the CIA courtyard<br>*(U) Notes: <br>GRSOC = Ft Gordon Regional Security Operations Center <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p></p>
