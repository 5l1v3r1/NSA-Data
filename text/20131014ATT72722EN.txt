Introduction

This session will focus on the question of whether the alleged surveillance activities would, if
confirmed, be in violation of law, whether at international, Council of Europe, EU or national
level. A key question in this regard is the impact on fundamental rights and, in particular the
right to data protection and privacy. In order for this question to be answered it is necessary,
firstly, to determine, as far as possible, the facts about the surveillance activities in question
and, secondly, the law applicable.

At least four different types of alleged surveillance issues would need to be distinguished,
namely (i) the NSA mass surveillance of EU citizens / legal entities in terms of electronic or
phone communications, (ii) its spying on Member States' embassies and EU institutions,
bodies, offices and agencies, (iii) the cooperation of Member States' authorities in the
aforementioned programs and/or access to the data produced in result, as well as (iv) the
surveillance activities conducted by Member States themselves.

As for the law applicable, besides the US legal framework which has in part been discussed in
previous sessions, this session will cover international law, notably UN instruments, the legal
framework and case-law produced by the Council of Europe institutions, as well as EU law
and relevant national law of the Member States.

The discussion of the applicable law includes as well the discussion as to the division of
competences between the national level and the EU level.

On the one side, the Treaty on European Union states that "competences not conferred upon
the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States" (Article 4(1) TEU) and that
"national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State" (Article 4(2) TEU).
Also, whereas the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly confers certain
competences on the EU under Title V of Part Three on the Area of Freedom, Security and
Justice, certain provisions in this same Title state that this "shall not affect the exercise of the
responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and
order and the safeguarding of internal security" (Article 72 TFEU) as well as that "[i]t shall be
open to Member States to organise between themselves and under their responsibility such
forms of cooperation and coordination as they deem appropriate between the competent
departments of their administrations responsible for safeguarding national security." (Article
73 TFEU)

On the other side, the EU has exercised the competences conferred upon it by the EU Treaties
in matters of internal security by deciding on a number of legislative instruments and
international agreements aimed at fighting serious crime and terrorism, on setting-up an
internal security strategy and agencies working in this field. It needs to be assessed therefore
whether or not EU competences in the field of security have been excluded in so far as they
relate to matters of national security. If this is the case, the question then arises as to the exact
extent of this exclusion. Alternatively, to the extent that EU competences have not been
excluded in the field of security, the question arises as to whether certain provisions of the
Treaty refer instead to the manner in which those competences will be "exercised" by the EU,
and whether there is a distinction to be made between legislative competences and the

execution of operational measures needed to implement EU legislation, as some academics

have suggested. 1

Court cases on Surveillance Programmes

A number of court cases have been initiated in different EU Member States (France, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Germany, Netherlands and UK), ever since the alleged NSA activities, as well
as some national ones, were made public. Representatives have been invited who will present
two cases.

First, La Fédération Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l’Homme and La Ligue française
pour la défense des droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen have submitted a complaint against X to
the Tribunal de Grand Instance of Paris, for several crimes concerning unauthorised access
and use of personal data, following the revelations made by Edward Snowden.

Second, Big Brother Watch will present their complaint (lodged together with English PEN,
Open Rights Group and Dr Constanze Kurz) before the European Court of Human Rights,
which concern alleged violation of Article 8 ECHR by the UK government, due to the latter's
involvement in NSA activities as well as its own Tempora programme.
