DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Generally Speaking: Driving History<br>FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 05/03/2004<br><br>(U) Have you ever made a decision or performed an action and then stepped back and wondered<br>about the historical significance of that decision or action? In the work we do, with our unique<br>perspective on global events, it is often easy to feel like an observer of history, rather than a<br>participant or an actor. So, we are often oblivious to the major roles we play in history.<br>(U) We may think we are all passengers on the "Magic History Bus", but in reality we all have a<br>steering wheel, a gas pedal, and a brake, and the actions and decisions we make every day<br>drive and steer history.<br>(S//SI) The cryptographers working at Bletchley Park during World War II to break the German<br>Enigma encryption probably had little conception, at the time, of the importance of their work.<br>Yet, the efforts of those cryptologists represent one of the greatest achievements in cryptology<br>and are widely regarded as a key to allied victory. I think years from now, historians may look<br>back at the role of NSA in the Global War on Terrorism in a similar light - and will conclude that<br>the work done in the Global SIGINT Enterprise played a key role in the success of our nation.<br>(S//SI) I think it is important for us to sense the moment - to understand that a significant<br>portion of the outcome of this war rests on our shoulders, and to realize that we are indeed<br>making history in the work we do. At night when we go home, it is easy to forget the impact of<br>our daily work on the events we see on the nightly news. It's also easy to forget, that in many<br>ways, when we come to work we are soldiers on the front lines and our decisions and actions will<br>make or break us as a nation.<br>(S//SI) For the past 2 Â½ years, you've been fighting this fight and assuming the burden. All of<br>us, whether working from home offices or volunteering for deployment (over 1500 people have<br>deployed since 9/11!!) are part of this fight. Other SIGINTers have come out of retirement, or<br>come back as reservists. We are all working for the good of the nation. To everyone I say: keep<br>up the great work! And when you have a moment, take a step back and realize the important<br>roles you are playing in this critical time for our nation. You are driving history!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
