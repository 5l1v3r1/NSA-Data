Barton<br>Lead, SIGINT Acquisition and Capabilities Analysis Center of Excellence<br>(S01R2)<br>Run Date: 09/07/2004<br>(U//FOUO) (Note: If you are in the Acquisition &amp; Business Management Skill Community or work<br>on any program, read below about an important Acquisition Analysis workshop.)<br>(U//FOUO) June 2003 was a watershed month, or one of infamy. Your opinion depends on which<br>side of the acquisition fence you sit philosophically. This was the month that the new JCIDS*<br>documents (CJCSI3170) arrived at NSA's doors and described for us the process that the DoD<br>expects us to use to identify capability gaps, describe prospective solutions, and justify<br>expenditures.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are of the old school at NSA, where you throw money to bridge the capability<br>gaps you've identified, then you hated June 2003. If, however, you are of the school that<br>believes that money must be justly and rightly spent on proven capability gap solutions, then<br>June 2003 was a banner month: wisdom in the acquisition process had indeed arrived!<br>(U//FOUO) But, even if you are of the positive ilk, the JCIDS documents describe a process, but<br>give scant direction on how to carry it off. Take for example the acquisition analysis piece (read<br>Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)), which the documents state must be part of an acquisition<br>program's history. An AoA is required for ACAT 1, ACAT 1A, and Major Acquisition of Information<br>System (MAIS) solution programs. The documents reference parent documents such as DoDI<br>5000.2, which in turn reference the Clinger-Cohen act, but no specific guidance is provided on<br>exactly how to pull off the AoA. 5000.2 even goes so far as to state that the AoA is required<br>because it helps justify expenditure by considering how a capability gap solution,<br>Illuminates capability advantages and disadvantages<br>Considers joint operational plans<br>Examines sufficient feasible alternatives<br>Discusses key assumptions and variables and sensitivity to changes in these<br>Assesses technology risk and maturity<br>Calculates costs<br>(U//FOUO) How do we, then, reconcile the requirement for acquisition analysis with the lack of<br>guidance on how to do it? There is a solution on the horizon. You are invited to attend a<br>workshop entitled "Acquisition Analysis (AoA) for Conceptual IT Solutions within the<br>Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)" . The workshop will be<br>held at nearby JHU/APL from 5 to 7 October. The workshop is your opportunity to see the<br>results of cross-organizational efforts to develop an NSA policy and manual for conducting<br>acquisition analysis for IT-based systems, learn how to conduct an AoA, or even to provide your<br>two-cents worth to the AoA manual. The workshop presenters come from within NSA, the<br>broader acquisition community, the military, and academia. For workshop agenda and<br>registration details, contact Kevan L. Barton (contact info below).<br>(U//FOUO) If you are in the Acquisition &amp; Business Management Skill Community, the workshop<br>is a must. If you are working on any program (e.g. transformation activity like CMM,<br>TRAILBLAZER, etc.), it is paramount.<br>(U//FOUO) Acquisition analysis is here to stay. It makes sense. It isn't as onerous as you'd<br>expect. We hope to see you at the workshop.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information and registration go to this website . <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">*(U) Notes: <br>JCIDS = Joint Concept Capabilities Integration and Development System <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
