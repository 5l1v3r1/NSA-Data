The conference will educate<br>SIGINT collection managers from throughout the Intelligence Community regarding how the<br>SIGINT system operates, and how it reacts to SIGINT needs levied upon it.<br>(U//FOUO) Specifically, attendees will learn about the processes, resources, tools, workflow etc.<br>that are brought to bear, from understanding the customer's needs, through to the SIGINT<br>response in terms of SIGINT production. The focus will primarily be on enhancing the utility<br>of SIGINT by bringing together the producers and users of SIGINT to discuss areas of<br>concern, capabilities, limitations, and continuing needs.<br>(U//FOUO) The agenda will deal with the processes and challenges associated with producing<br>SIGINT, and will offer opportunities to dialog with SID experts and the visiting collection<br>managers. The conference attendees will gain much from this conference, to include:<br>a raised awareness of legal, policy, and operational parameters within which the SIGINT<br>system operates;<br>a better understanding of the workflow used to accomplish SIGINT, and of the technology<br>constraints we operate with, as well as the new technology we can leverage; and<br>ideas about how to best shape Information Needs, so that NSA can better understand the<br>customer's intent and desired outcome.<br>(S) The following tours, demos and training will be offered on a reservation basis:<br>Tour of the Meade Operations Center (MOC). The MOC is one of the largest collection<br>and reporting facilities in the United States Cryptologic System and performs many of the<br>same functions as other U.S. intercept sites around the world. The Center utilizes stateof-the art remoting technology for airborne, terrestrial, and spaceborne collection and<br>reporting in response to national and tactical intelligence requirements.<br>A demonstration of the Information Needs (IN) Tool , which scans the text of reports<br>and suggests a list of INs for the reporter to consider, based on keyword patterns found<br>in the text. This can considerably speed up the process of identifying INs to cite, and<br>increase the number of relevant INs cited on reports.<br>National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) Training . This hands-on tool<br>training session on the NSRP National Customer Interface client application is intended<br>for individuals who will create or edit Information Needs to be levied on NSA, or who<br>support SIGINT customers in doing so.<br>(U//FOUO) Be sure to mark the dates 19-23 July on your calendar.
