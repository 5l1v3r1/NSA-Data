(S//SI//REL) SID Analysts Can Now Unminimize Incidentally Collected UK Contact Identifiers

SIGINT Policy (S02L1)

Run Date: 05/16/2007

(S//SI//REL) SIGINT Policy (S02L1) and the UK Liaison Office here at NSAW worked together to come up with a new policy that expands the use of
incidentally collected unminimized UK data in SIGINT analysis. The new policy expands the previous memo issued in 2004 that only allowed the
unminimizing of incidentally collected UK phone numbers for use in analysis. Now SID analysts can unminimize all incidentally collected UK contact
identifiers, including IP and email addresses, fax and cell phone numbers, for use in analysis. Analysts:

•	(S//SI//REL) Are authorized to unmask UK contact identifiers resulting from incidental collection. Incidental collection is defined as foreign com
munications collected/selected incidental to the original SIGINT task.

•	(S//SI//REL) May utilize the UK contact identifiers in SIGINT development contact chaining analysis. The UK contact identifiers will not be the
primary subject of SIGINT collection or analysis other than contact chaining except under existing authorization procedures.

•	(S//SI//REL) Will not deliberately collect against nor target UK contact identifiers for content unless so authorized.

•	(S//SI//REL) Will continue to minimize UK contact identifiers in any SIGINT product/service to include the dissemination of SIGINT metadata
provided for foreign intelligence purposes in accordance with existing policy and procedures.

•	(S//SI//REL) May retain unminimized UK contact identifiers incidentally collected under this authority within content and metadata stores and
provided to follow-on USSS (US SIGINT System) applications.

•	(S//SI//REL) Are not required to forward unmasked UK contact identifiers to GCHQ unless specifically requested by GCHQ. GCHQ should

receive all unmasked UK contact identifiers via established or mutually agreed forwarding means or the contact identifiers should be available in
the GCHQ-accessible 5-eyes	database, the	access to	or other GCHQ- accessible metadata stores.
