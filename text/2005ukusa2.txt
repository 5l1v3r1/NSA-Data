b) (S//NF) Unilaterally by the Signals Intelligence Directorate:
When sharing the planned targeting information with a Second
Party would be contrary to U.S. interests, or when the Second Party
declines a collaboration proposal, the proposed targeting must be
presented to the Signals Intelligence Director for approval with
justification for the criticality of the proposed collection. If approved,
any collection, processing and dissemination of the Second Party
information must be maintained in NOFORN channels.
