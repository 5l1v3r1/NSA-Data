Three-Feather Solution

GALLANTWAVE application

-	Same module supports NetDef and SIGINT

-	Supports dynamic update of targeting via UTT

-	Supports static target updates

GALLANTWAVE Reinjection application
Same module supports NetDef and SIGINT

Supports re-injection of decrypt into TURMOIL for detection by BLUESNORT

BLUESNORT in Stage 1 Prime application
Emits events off decrypted, re-packetized, reinjected data

Status

Running on MHS DEV ESO T5 and T22

Transform, Reinjection, Signature Hits
confirmed

Signatures need further development
to produce true hits vs. false positives

NTOC POC reviewing XKS hits to
generate new signatures.

Issues/Risks

1.	CA Servers at Net Defense Sites

,> ITx Connectivity to LONCHAUL

w NTOC requires stand-up of separate dev and live ITx fabric
¡.	- H/W funding may be needed

a. - Need paperwork for update to firewall - submission expected by 25 Feb
o Expected completion was 29 Feb; now delayed to TBD
di SSH connectivity

& Short term: via BLUEBOX CA Servers at Pentagon - done

o Longer term: via deployment of servers within the NTOC enclave that connect to CA Servers in the field

2.	GALLANTWAVE Targeting Challenges

MAILORDER/Ni-FI not yet available

m Mitigation: Manually load static targeting files

CoreSSC gets UTT updates, tri^{^AhiA©1Erl§ets |
GW-TargetManager responds to IbâdTargets request
from CoreSSC, pulls the GW IP addresses from the
Targeting database; issues control-flow messages
for each IP:Port combination and sends periodic
updates for those.

FCP responds to control-flow messages by
promoting all packets to/from the targeted IP:port
combinations, and PacketRouter ensures these
packets are sent to GW-FIP for sessionization. GW-
FIP outputs 'raw' SOTF session-fragments to the
TE-GW service on the same host.

GW-SessionFilter identifies sessions containing
target technology-of-interest by applying an
appropriate appld tag to each session-fragment.
GW-FragmentFilter removes session-fragments not
containing an appropriate appld for the target
technology-of-interest. Additionally, as a work-
around for an issue in FIP 3.1.10, erroneous
session-fragments missing a specific metadata
filed are removed. GW-MI applies SRI obtained
from Dfid Allocator.
