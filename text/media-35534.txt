Increment 3 Requirement



TURMOIL shall reinject 
lP traffic into BLUESNORT for malicious

network activity detection.

Three-Feather Solution

1. GALLANTWAVE application
Same module supports NetDef and SIGINT
Supports dynamic update of targeting via 
Supports static target updates

2. GALLANTWAVE Reinjection application
Same module supports NetDef and SIGINT
Supports re-injection of into TURMOIL for detection by BLUESNORT

3. BLUESNORT in Stage 1 Prime application
Emits events off re-packetized, reinjected data

Status

- Running Transform, Reinjection, Signature Hits
confirmed

- Signatures need further development
to produce true hits vs. false positives

- NTOC POC reviewing XKS hits to
generate new signatures.

Issues/Risks

1. CA Servers at Net Defense Sites
5) Connectivity to LONGHAUL

bi NTOC requires stand-up of separate dev and live fabric

i. - funding may be needed

ii. - Need paperwork for update to firewall submission expected by 25 Feb
a Expected completion was 29 Feb; now delayed to TBD

a SSH connectivity

e; Short term: via BLUEBOX CA Servers at Pentagon - done

in Longer term: via deployment ofservers within the NTOC enclave that connect to CA Servers in the field

2. GALLANTWAVE Targeting Challenges
5) not yet available

a Mitigation: Manually load static targeting files

GW?TargetManager responds to loadTa rgets request
from pulls the GW IP addresses from the
Targeting database; issues control?flow messages
for each IP:Port combination and sends periodic
updates for those.

FCP responds to control?flow messages by
promoting all packets to/from the targeted |P:port
combinations, and PacketRouter ensures these
packets are sent to for sessionization. 
FIP outputs 'raw' SOTF session?fragments to the
service on the same host.

GW?SessionFilter identifies sessions containing
target technology?of?interest by applying an
appropriate appld tag to each session?fragment.
GW?FragmentFilter removes session?fragments not
containing an appropriate appld for the target
technology?of?interest. Additionally, as a work?
around for an issue in FIP 3.1.10, erroneous
session?fragments missing a specific metadata
filed are removed. applies SRI obtained
