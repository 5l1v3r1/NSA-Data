First Instance Reporting (FIR) refers to SIGINT end product reporting which normally<br>focuses on targets, issues and personalities of specific interest to local SIGINT customers, but<br>may include information addressing national level priorities.<br>(U//FOUO) This reporting is derived from field collection facilities with limited or no access to<br>national level analytic databases and sources; therefore, it may include only part of the story.<br>Users of this information should strive to match this information with other sources and as with<br>all reporting, stay vigilant for additional NSA/Extended Enterprise reporting.<br>(S) LSRs -- produced by SCS sites worldwide-- historically were disseminated to a very limited<br>customer set and could not be used by customers in briefings, summaries, assessments, etc,<br>until the NSAW TOPI** had evaluated the information fully and issued that information in an<br>NSAW end-product report.<br>(S) First Instance Reporting allows all customers interested in and cleared for SIGINT on a given<br>topic to receive the information produced by the field sites without waiting for NSAW to evaluate<br>and reissue that information in an end product. The intitiative also allows customers to request<br>post-publication services (ORCON*** release, foreign release, identity release) related to the<br>first instance reporting. SCS sites currently producing LSRs will transition to FIRs between now<br>and the end of January 2005. FIRs will include a caveat underscoring the fact that NSAW has not<br>verified the information.<br>(U//FOUO) This initiative will replace Local Support Reports with which some customers<br>are familiar and is intended to make the SIGINT produced by the field collection facilities more<br>accessible to a broader audience and easier for customers to use:<br>FIRs will generally be disseminated to any customer that has a need and is cleared for<br>the information in the report.<br>Unlike Local Support Reports, which universally carried an ORCON handling caveat, FIRs<br>will be ORCON only when the sensitivity of the content requires that handling.<br>Customers may use any non-ORCON information immediately in summaries,<br>assessments, etc. without waiting for NSA HQ to review and reissue the information in<br>another format. As a reminder, this information is derived from field collection facilities<br>with limited or no access to national level analytic databases and sources; therefore, it<br>may include only part of the story.<br>In addition, as with all SIGINT end-product reports, customers may request approval<br>from S121's SIGINT Post-Publication Services Branch for ORCON release, Foreign<br>Release, or US identity release based on an FIR. This was not possible with Local Support<br>Reports.<br>(U//FOUO) Much like other basic end product, FIRs will often be the first serialized report on an<br>issue, event or activity, and may be the only reporting on the issue, event or activity.
