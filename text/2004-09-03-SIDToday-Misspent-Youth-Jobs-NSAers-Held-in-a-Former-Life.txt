DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Misspent Youth? -- Jobs NSAers Held in a 'Former Life'<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/03/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) To mark the upcoming Labor Day weekend, we thought it would be interesting to ask<br>NSAers what unusual kinds of jobs they performed prior to working at the Agency. Here's what<br>we learned!<br>Plant Taxonomist, USDA Plant Germplasm Quarantine Lab, and<br>Lab Research Aide, Creutzfeldt-Jakob (Mad Cow Disease) Research Lab, National<br>Institutes of Health<br>-A service station attendant in Yellowstone National Park.<br>-- <br>In the early 1990's I worked part time as a Jump Instructor for a company called<br>Adrenaline Adventures. We did bungee jumping out of hot air balloons!<br>-- <br>A Fingerprint Technician at the FBI.<br>-- <br>I once worked as a "buttoner" in a Ship-and-Shore (women's clothing brand name)<br>blouse factory for a summer (high school age). For 7 hours a day, using a buttoning hook<br>(like the kind that women used in the early 1900s to button their shoes), going through<br>bundles of 20-30 blouses, I buttoned the front plackets of blouses (and the cuffs, if they<br>had buttons)...<br>-- Anonymous<br>When I was 19 years old, I was hired by the State's civil engineering firm for a 3-month<br>job to be a Highway Stripping Inspector of the Florida Turnpike being built. I had the<br>tough job of driving behind a contractor truck spraying lines of paint on the highway for<br>hundreds of miles to ensure that they were spraying straight, spraying solid lines when<br>required, and that the lines sparkled enough to be able to see them at night. For a 19<br>year old kid, having an air conditioned company car, and an expense account for meals<br>and rooms was like being in heaven.<br>-- <br>Retail hardware department manager.<br>-- <br><br> </p>Prior to coming to the Agency 23 years ago, I spent 7 years driving an 18 wheeler (semi)<br>coast to coast and border to border. As you can imagine, this experience had absolutely<br>nothing to do with the fact I was hired to copy Morse code as a Collections Operations<br>Technician and took a 66% pay cut!<br>-- <br>Busboy at the "World's Largest Shore Dinner Hall," overlooking Narragansett Bay. (A<br>"shore dinner" consists of chowder, clam cakes, steamed clams, corn on the cob, lobster,<br>indian pudding, watermelon, etc.)<br>-- SID today Editor<br>While I was in high school, one of my part-time jobs was as an egg-setter at a chick<br>hatchery. This consisted of loading and unloading many trays of 9 dozen eggs each into<br>100 degree incubators.<br>-- <br>A tomato mite counter. (This was a college summer job. Students working for the<br>university's Entomology Department counted the mites with an electron microscope in<br>order to see which insecticides were the most effective. They also counted insects on<br>eucalyptus bark.)<br>-- <br>Job Title: Paper Sorter<br>In a previous life I used to be a paper sorter. It was fun (minus the paper cuts)! I got to<br>climb in and out of great big boxes (being so short...) and sorted paper into different<br>"grades." I even learned how to operate a fork lift. Later, when I began working for<br>contractors and the government (remember when they used to ask about the machines<br>you could operate) I always included fork lifts under "business machines." I got a kick<br>out of interviewers' faces.<br>-- Anonymous<br>Prior to my employment at NSA, I did all of the following:<br>a) achieved certification in dressmaking and fashion design as a couterier and custom<br>clothier;<br>b) held a real estate license;<br>c) taught ice dancing and figure skating;<br>d) was an Account Administrator/Research Assistant/ and Assistant Counselor at the<br>Maryland-based investment counsel and mutual funds corporation, T. Rowe Price;<br>e) was Executive Secretary to the Chairman of the Board, Executive Vice President, and<br>Senior VPs at the main office of the Savings Bank of Baltimore.<br>-- <br>Right after high school I got a job at the local PBS-affiliated TV station, WVIA-TV. I<br>worked in the mailroom, swept the floors, and made deliveries in the station's car. But<br>my main job was being the puppeteer on a kids' show called "Magic Window." Five days a<br>week the grandmotherly hostess would open the magic window to see who would show<br>up. There I was, sitting beneath the window and sticking up my arms while wearing hand<br>puppets, and yes, I also provided their voices. I later became a camera-man at the<br>station when we were shorthanded. The director of another show asked if I knew how to<br>operate the camera. I said yes, and he went back to the control room. As soon as he left<br>the studio, I went to another camera-man and asked him to "show me how to work this<br><br> </p>thing." .<br>-- Anonymous<br>Job Title: Pulpwood Harvester<br>Job Requirements: Fell small damaged, sick, or burned trees on public forest lands in<br>Minnesota in the WINTER. Limb trunks and cut into 6-ft. lengths and stack. The trees to<br>be cut for pulpwood were marked by State and Federal Forest Service personnel.<br>Special Considerations: Work clothing suitable to MINUS 40 Fahrenheit, chainsaw, and an<br>axe. The "right" to cut the trees within a designated section was acquired by bid. Once<br>the wood was stacked, it was measured for the total "board feet" and you were paid by<br>the paper mill that had contracted for the timber. Since this was an agricultural product,<br>the price fluctuated and you never knew how much you would be paid until the day the<br>stacks were measured. You hoped to make enough to at least recover your bid and pay<br>for the chainsaw gas and transportation costs to-and-from the site. Often the only way in<br>was by snowmobile and deep snow made the work that much more difficult. It was<br>physically demanding and the "job of last resort" in a depressed rural economy with a<br>high unemployment rate. There was no overtime, paid vacations, or medical benefits.<br>Conclusion: A "bad day" at NSA is better than a "good day" cutting pulpwood!<br>-- <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
