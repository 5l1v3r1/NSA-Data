Would you like to know of such events? There is a simple way to share such<br>information as well as learn it. The External Conference Calendar , which can be found from a<br>link in the "Calendars" section of the SID today page, makes it easy to do either. With a few<br>mouse clicks, anyone can put seminars, events or conferences - open source or classified - on<br>the calendar.<br>(U) This unique means of information-sharing alerts a possibly unknown audience to academic,<br>business, intelligence community, or other conferences, with potentially great payoff. For<br>instance, someone in a Crime &amp; Narcotics branch attending a conference on "International<br>Reduction of Crime" may not realize that there are others in seemingly unconnected areas, such<br>as counterterrorism, homeland security, or research and development that could benefit from<br>the target knowledge and discussions. When the conference is listed for all to see, everyone with<br>an interest will be aware.<br>(U) The External Conference Calendar gives us all a chance to convey opportunities for learning,<br>career developing, and target knowledge.
