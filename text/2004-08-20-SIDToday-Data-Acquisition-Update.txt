Today we'll concentrate on work meant to connect the great efforts<br>underway in our line organizations and around the extended enterprise.<br>(TS//SI) A recent SID Today article is a great illustration of why this "glue logic" is vital. The<br>article passed on kudos to a whole host of SIGINTers who were instrumental in the May 30th<br>capture of an important terrorist named Umar Baziyani. It's a wonderful example of seamless<br>interaction with the CT product line, field elements, and tactical units in Iraq, and we plan to tell<br>this story in greater depth later. For now, here are a few themes that can be drawn from it and<br>similar operations:<br>1.  (TS//SI) Metadata collection and SIGINT Development drove the operation, making it<br>possible to map logical communication data into physical locations, and ultimately to tip<br>tactical units to target location and activity.<br>2.  (TS//SI) Highly interactive use of diverse accesses was critical. Warranted collection<br>pointed to target locations in cyberspace; computer network exploitation added<br>informative tags to internet cafÃ© data to allow collection at Menwith Hill.<br>3.  (TS//SI) Tracking Iraqi internet users, and similar tough challenges, requires increasingly<br>creative technical and operational strategies. In just this one operation, commercial<br>relationships, endpoint operations, cryptanalytic exploitation using special purpose<br>hardware, and midpoint collection all had to pull together to track a single individual.<br>(U//FOUO) It took heroic efforts by key individuals to make all of these things happen in this<br>particular operation. That won't scale unless we learn the lessons offered by this and similar<br>cases, and build the infrastructure and tools needed to make this work much, much easier. Here<br>is a barebones outline of a few of the activities underway to support this:<br>(U//FOUO) A metadata strategy has been developed to unify the many strands of related<br>activity already underway in the SIGINT system. We are very pleased to have <br>serving as the lead for this; she is already actively involved with many of you.<br>(TS//SI) Getting our diverse accesses tied together is a really tough challenge. Some seemingly<br>small things can make a huge difference. For example, TRAFFICTHIEF is the cross-access tipping<br>service at the core of this operation. Starting as a small project led by two entrepreneurial<br>individuals, <br> it has grown into an essential service in constant<br>use for counter-terrorism operations.<br>(S) The Network Analysis Center (NAC), one of three key SIGINT Development centers, provides<br>cutting edge analysis of challenging target networks, providing the information needed to create<br>effective access and exploitation strategies.<br>(S) The new Global Network Development Activity (GNDA) will create an environment for<br>exploiting Special Source programs and a test-bed for learning how to use all of our accesses to<br>identify, locate and collect a dynamic, mobile target set. GNDA is developing entity extraction<br>techniques through metadata.<br>(S) On an even larger scale, we've established the Global Network Forum, a 5 Eyes construct to<br>manage midpoint accesses on a community basis. Its first order of business is to bring coherence<br>to our planning for and development of accesses to international communications, whether<br>carried over the RF or not.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U//FOUO) We are also working closely with ITIS and the Senior Acquisition Executive/Program<br>Executive Office (SAE/PEO) to get the right IT services deployed around the world to support<br>the cross-access communications needed to make all this work on the scale and at the speed<br>required.<br>(U//FOUO) Ever since 9/11, Data Acquisition has hosted a forum (the Terrorist Pursuit Team) for<br>exploration of new counter-terrorism requirements: we have the players explain the problems,<br>send smart people away to create solutions, and then decide how/when/where to find the<br>resources. It's a successful model, which we will shortly expand into a Requirements Process<br>that will cover all challenges that aren't more properly dealt with at a higher (SID or corporate<br>NSA) or lower (one of the Data Acquisition groups, or a field site, or ITIS) level.<br>(U//FOUO) We have also obtained the services of <br> from SID Systems Engineering,<br>to advise us on systems engineering issues that come up as we try to add functionality and<br>connectedness to an already complex system. <br> will also make sure that the improvements<br>we make are done so in a way that will fit into NSA's transformational programs.<br>(U//FOUO) That's more than enough for now.
