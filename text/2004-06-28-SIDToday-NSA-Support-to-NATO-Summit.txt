Maines, Dan Ennis and<br>Europe Issue Management Team<br>Run Date: 06/28/2004<br>FROM: Marilyn J. Maines, Dan Ennis and<br>Europe Issue Management Team <br>(S) The NATO Summit in Istanbul, 28-29 June 2004, is the last of the three summits in June (G8, US-European Union, and NATO) where the major US international security initiatives will be<br>discussed with our closest allies. Interest in this event is heightened by the participation of the<br>U.S. President, George Bush in the Summit itself, preceded by a two-day visit to Ankara on 2627 June. Since early May, NSA has been working at Headquarters, throughout the extended<br>enterprise and in close cooperation with foreign partners to provide security for this event.<br>(S) High Terrorist Threat Potential for this Summit, in a Summer of Many High Profile<br>Events...<br>(S) The Summit will be a high profile event with close to 60 heads of state -- including the<br>President -- and their chief military and foreign policy advisers attending. The bombings in<br>Istanbul in November, March and May, and in Madrid in March, plus the discovery of several<br>bombs on train tracks in Spain and France in March, and significant terrorist threats against<br>Turkey make the security environment for the Summit a great concern. Some people are<br>referring to the Summit as a potential terrorist "Superbowl" and the Director of Central<br>Intelligence has raised the level of community focus for this event. Recent raids in the vicinity of<br>Istanbul by the Turkish National Police -- allegedly targeting groups with connections to Sunni<br>extremist groups planning to attack or disrupt the Summit -- have raised security concerns even<br>higher.<br>(U) From What Terrorist Groups Will the Primary Threat Come?<br>(S) Terrorist groups would consider the NATO Summit a hard target. Security around the<br>Summit venues would probably preclude any serious terrorist targeting of the immediate<br>Summit facilities during the event. However, terrorists would regard the Summit as a lucrative<br>target because the large number of world leaders attending and the symbolism that NATO<br>evokes would automatically turn any terrorist act into a dramatic event embarrassing the<br>Turkish government.<br>(S) The US Intelligence Community assesses the greatest threat to the Summit comes from Al<br>Qa'ida and its affiliates or sympathetic Islamic groups. Other potential terrorist groups posing a<br>medium-to-high level threat are Ansar al-Islam and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).<br>A secondary threat is posed by Domestic Turkish extremist groups including the Revolutionary<br>People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), the Maoist Communist Party (MKP, formerly the<br>Turkish Communist Party/Marxist Leninist, TKP/ML), Kongra Gel (formerly Kadek/PKK) and<br>Turkish Hisballah. National or international anti-global, anarchist type groups, such as Great<br>Eastern Raiders-Front, pose a less serious threat that is likely to be disruptive rather than<br>destructive. There is also the "wild card" possibility of an attack from unknown terrorists, taking<br>advantage of this world stage opportunity.<br><br>(S//SI) NSA and Intelligence Community Support on the Ground in Istanbul<br>(S//SI) To meet the challenge in Istanbul,<br>NSA has supplied four senior SIGINT analysts -- two from Headquarters and two from<br>NCEUR* -- to work in the US Fusion Cell , led by CIA and located in the New US<br>Consulate building.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">NCR <br> NSA's Senior Representative in country, will be working with CIA Chief of<br>Station Ankara and Chief of Base Istanbul and with Turkish and NATO partners as part of<br>a multi-national International Intelligence Group , located at Turkish National<br>Intelligence Organization (TNIO) office near the Summit Hall.<br>An Executive Protection Team , located at the Hilton Hotel in Istanbul, where the US<br>President will be located, will be working in close cooperation with the Special Collection<br>Service (SCS).

Counterterrorism, International Security Issues (ISI) and the GEO Product Line<br>have all stood up 24/7 watch efforts for the duration of the Summit.
