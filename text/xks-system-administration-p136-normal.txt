database may have hung up the query dispatch
process. Check the progress of queries on the

►	Type select status,count(*) from sdb_query_jobs
where group by status;

•	The select statement displays the current state of

queries appear in the new state when compared
to other query databases, begin troubleshooting
the problem query_proc on the specified query
database.
