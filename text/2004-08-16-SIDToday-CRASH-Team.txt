In response, the Agency's Follow-the-Money Branch (S2C22) brought together experts<br>from across a spectrum of disciplines and organizations in SID to focus on the problem. The<br>resulting colocated team, known as the North Korea CRASH (Combined Rapid Analysis and<br>Synthesis Hit) Team , uses financial intelligence collection and analysis methodologies against<br>traditionally non-financial targets.<br>(S//SI) One key to the CRASH team's success has been its access to North Korean financial<br>transaction data routed through foreign banks, a lucrative source for intelligence production and<br>SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) efforts. The team has partnered with experienced analysts<br>having target, analytic, language, and reporting expertise from five divisions across both the<br>International Security Issues (S2C) and China and Korea (S2B) Product Lines to fully exploit this<br>information.<br>(S//SI) What have we accomplished so far? We have...<br>Created a database (a spreadsheet and several iterations) of North Korean financial<br>assets held outside the country, giving a snapshot with a great deal of information in an<br>easy-to-read format.<br>Targeted leadership finance. This produced a significant amount of new non-financial<br>intelligence on weapons shipments, trading and infrastructure developments, etc.<br>Produced a stream of intelligence on mechanisms used to sell North Korean precious<br>metals -- allegedly personally owned by North Korean leader Kim Chong-il.<br>Identified North Korean regime vulnerabilities -- pressure points revealed by its<br>concentration of financial activity in limited hands and locations.<br>Produced a body of SIGINT reporting that helped U.S. policymakers curtail North Korea's<br>banking presence in Europe.<br>Isolated key regime relationships that were not evident in the traditional SIGINT analytic<br>approach.<br>Targeted financial institutions as collection targets in their own right. This revealed<br>several instances of their complicity in North Korea's efforts to avoid scrutiny of its<br>activities.<br>(S//SI) If you would like to learn more about these efforts, or know of new ways that CRASH can<br>collaborate productively with your organization, we would like to hear from you!
