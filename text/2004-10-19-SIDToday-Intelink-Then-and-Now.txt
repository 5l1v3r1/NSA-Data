In response,<br>the Defense Department and the Intelligence Community jointly commissioned an Architecture<br>Framework Panel in late 1993 to try to find a solution. After studying the matter for about four<br>months, the Panel had written a lengthy document that enumerated many high-level<br>requirements for improving connectivity. But rather than expecting people to read the<br>document, the Panel searched for ways to show senior DOD and IC officials what was really<br>needed.<br>(U) World Wide Web technology was new and answered about 60% of the requirements. It was<br>also free, a major selling point at that point in the fiscal year. So about 10 organizations agreed<br>to host web servers on JWICS -- the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System -- a<br>Top Secret SI/TK NOFORN network and called the service "Intelink." They hosted examples of<br>multimedia reports, music, video footage, and text reports that would show the broad range of<br>capability that was needed to address many of the problems exhibited during DESERT SHIELD<br>and DESERT STORM. By August 1994, the DCI and Deputy Secretary of Defense declared that<br>Intelink was the strategic direction for intelligence dissemination.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA was one of the original agencies to participate in Intelink. At the time of the<br>initial prototype, NSA's sole contribution to Intelink was the SIGINT Digest, a predecessor to<br>today's Global SIGINT Highlights, and which included maps, graphics, and images. It proved<br>that anyone could, indeed, share multimedia-based reports and that customers could see them<br>in all their intended glory.<br>(U//FOUO) Intelink was declared operational on 1 December 1994. In January 1995, NSA began<br>offering 45-days' worth of openly sharable SIGINT product online-searchable through serial, TAG<br>line, and keyword in title. That offering was enhanced through the addition of topics of high<br>interest that allowed customers to click on a topic to see a list of SIGINT that responded to those<br>topics.<br>(U//FOUO) Over the years, NSA has gradually expanded its Intelink offerings to encompass a<br>year's worth of searchable SIGINT product online, all fully-sharable multimedia products,<br>information about services NSA offers, a whole line of Information Assurance products and<br>services, information to support war fighters, information on NSA, and so forth. In 2001, portal<br>technology was incorporated into NSA's Intelink service, allowing customers to subscribe to<br>information as it is published.<br>(U//FOUO) Soon after Intelink was declared operational, it became apparent that a TS SI/TK<br>NOFORN Intelink did not solve the national/tactical intelligence-sharing problem, because the<br>bulk of the tactical users were cleared only for SECRET. Since SECRET-cleared personnel were<br>unable to access JWICS and Intelink, another version of Intelink was created on the SECRET<br>Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) that is referred to as Intelink-S.<br>(C//SI) NSA has contributed as much SIGINT to Intelink-S as possible, but classification<br>restrictions and sanitization rules have restricted what could be placed on the NSA Intelink-S<br>site. With the advent of the Global War on Terrorism, however, NSA made a concerted effort to<br>increase the amount of actionable SIGINT available to tactical customers by extracting the<br>tearline portions of terrorism-related products, removing all association with NSA and placing<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">them on the Defense Intelligence Agency's Intelink-S server. This effort was expanded to<br>include Iraqi-related information, as well. In cooperation with the Army's Intelligence and<br>Security Command (INSCOM), in Spring 2004 NSA began pushing Iraqi-related tearlines directly<br>to tactical units in Iraq, with the tearline reports attributed to DOD Special Unit Number One<br>(DODSPECONE).<br>(U//FOUO) The hallmark of NSA's success in Intelink has been its customer focus. NSA's Intelink<br>sites are all organized based on how a customer would look for the information rather than<br>based on what organization within NSA produced the information. From the first day of<br>participation, NSA has provided feedback links seeking customer input on new services offered<br>and on the content provided. Feedback on SIGINT reporting is automatically loaded into PLUS,<br>SID's product metrics database.<br>(U//FOUO) The future for NSA's Intelink services remains bright. As transformation programs<br>deliver new capabilities, NSA's Intelink services will provide increasingly sophisticated search and<br>retrieval tools to facilitate customer access. Efforts to transform the underlying technology upon<br>which the Intelink services run today will continue. This will result in subscribers being able to<br>harness the vast power of information NSA offers in conjunction with that of other organizations<br>throughout DoD and the IC.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
