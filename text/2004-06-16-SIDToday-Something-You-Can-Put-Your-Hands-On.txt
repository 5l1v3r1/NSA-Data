As FY05 dawns and progresses, a total of 100 mission users at NSAW and 35 users<br>from the Extended Enterprise will test subsequent spirals of the TDP capabilities. MG Quirk,<br>Signals Intelligence Director, recognizes the significance of this event and will kick off the<br>orientation for the Operational Assessment analysts today, 16 June 2004.<br>(S//SI) The TDP Beta version will demonstrate capabilities that enable the operational<br>application of "Hunt vs. Gather." Transformational capabilities such as single sign-on, single<br>query across multiple knowledge bases, advanced storage, content summarization, and native<br>viewing will all be demonstrated across a mission (Counterterrorism) thread. Capabilities that<br>enable mission tools will also be demonstrated, and will include information-extraction<br>applications such as entity extraction, content categorization, entity relationships, embedded<br>multilingual processes, and a metadata process to track traffic and enhance collection.<br>(S//SI) Although the TDP Beta is the first delivery of TRAILBLAZER capabilities, the fact is that<br>over the last couple of years, TRAILBLAZER has sponsored a variety of programs that have<br>directly supported the transformation of SIGINT operations. These contributions include:<br>the rapid prototyping of critical mission applications such as the CES (Cryptanalysis and<br>Expolitation Services - S31) development of a new generation of DNI* processing<br>(WEALTHYCLUSTER),<br>smart packet filters (TUMBRIL),<br>the first strategic knowledge base, the Target Knowledge Base (TKB),<br>the DNE* viewer which was integrated into AGILEVIEW DNI viewer, and the<br>Target Operational Pilot series of rapid prototypes and pilot programs which have been<br>the basis for mission applications development and the part-time integree program.<br>(U) You can read more in the NSA Daily article: TRAILBLAZER Receives the First of Its Hardware<br>Deliverables .<br>*(U) Notes: <br>DNI = Digital Network Intelligence <br>DNE = Digital Network Exploitation <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
