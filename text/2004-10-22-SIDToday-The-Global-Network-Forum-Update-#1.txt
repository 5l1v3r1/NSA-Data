During the last Comsat<br>Planning Forum (CPF) in November 2003 the delegates realized that if targets were to be<br>tracked successfully the challenge must be addressed from a global perspective, and the only<br>way to achieve that was through the establishment of an access related Global Network Forum.<br>It was then unanimously agreed that the CPF would be disbanded and the Global Network Forum<br>established with a goal of holding the first meeting in June of 2004.<br>(S//SI) To make things more interesting, it was decided that not only would the GNF be<br>established by June of 2004, but it would also be tasked with addressing a high priority need<br>within the Link Access Programs group. One such challenge, gently simmering away, was the<br>sticky subject of Sensitive Data Sharing, a theme that fell in line with one of the principles<br>defined in the 5-Eyes SIGINT Partnership Business Vision -- The 5-Eyes SIGINT Enterprise will<br>subscribe to sharing as the preferred default option . Successfully identifying a mechanism that<br>allows the sharing of sensitive information between partners would ultimately enhance all<br>accesses and permit the appropriate dissemination of relevant data between intra-agency<br>organizations and inter-agency partners, critical to the success of exploiting the global network<br>to satisfy customer requirements.<br>(S//SI) Through a great deal of background work between the 5-EYES partners, the initial GNF<br>Charter was drafted, the structure of the GNF identified, and the principles of sensitive data<br>sharing established through the drafting of the "Tiered Approach to Sensitive Data Sharing"<br>document.<br>(U//FOUO) So, what have we achieved so far?<br>(C) Here's a list of the major agreements reached by partners during the conference:<br>The Charter and governance structure of the GNF was ratified<br>Agreement was reached on the formation of two new 5-Eyes bodies, subordinate to the<br>GNF:<br>The Special Source Advisory Board (SSAB)<br>The Collection Management Advisory Board (CMAB)<br>Agreement on the "Tiered Approach to Sensitive Data Sharing" proposal<br>The SSAB were charged with defining a new 5-Eyes ECI to support the new<br>agreement by December 2004, a task that is well on the way to completion.<br>Agreement on updates to the existing TICKETWINDOW CONOP* with an implementation<br>plan to be presented to the GNF in December 04. (TICKETWINDOW was established to<br>enable reciprocal data sharing with Second Party partners without jeopardizing sensitive<br>sources and methods).<br>(C) All are significant achievements, and ones that will improve our ability to develop a cohesive<br>strategic vision for the 5-Eyes Intelligence Community across global network accesses and<br>further strengthen the partnership between agencies.<br>(U//FOUO) So, where do we go from here?<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U//FOUO) Since that groundbreaking meeting we haven't rested on our laurels, and continue to<br>push forward on the actions from that forum and with preparations for the next conference to be<br>held at NSAW. Planning is now underway for the next GNF, 6th through 8th December, where<br>we will be discussing, among other things, the implementation plan for the TICKETWINDOW<br>updates, debating the options for including additional accesses into the GNF, reviewing the<br>terms of reference for the CMAB and SSAB, and attempting to identify commonality between<br>partners on the definition of a Global Access Map.<br>(U//FOUO) Again, a great deal of background work will be carried out with partners prior to the<br>forum to ensure we can reach agreement points promptly and cover the wide range of topics on<br>the agenda in the short time we have available. So, keep a look out on "SID today " for another<br>follow-up article after the December conference, and we'll tell you what agreements have been<br>reached and what new challenges the GNF has set itself to address.<br>(U) Notes: <br>*CONOP = Concept of Operations <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
