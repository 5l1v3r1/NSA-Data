World events such as the transition of power in<br>Iraq, hunt for the al-Qa'ida terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and the NATO summit have added<br>up to a real crunch time for SIGINTers.<br>(U//FOUO) In typical fashion, people in SID and the extended enterprise have worked long hours<br>and put forth the extra effort needed to keep pace with operational demands. Everyone has<br>pitched in to get the job done.<br>(U//FOUO) I want to say "thank you" to everyone who has been working especially hard this<br>summer, and to tell you that your efforts are not going unappreciated. Military and political<br>leaders value our SIGINT highly and recognize the strenuous efforts that have gone into<br>collecting, producing, and disseminating it in a timely manner.<br>(U) The SIGINT workforce -- both for skill and dedication - is simply second to none!
