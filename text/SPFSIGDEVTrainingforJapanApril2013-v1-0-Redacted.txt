SUMMARY

Development (SIGDEV) * to the Japanese Directorate for SIGINT (DFS) from 22-26 April 2013.

, ^ ^ ^

BACKGROUND: (S//REL) The Japanese Directorate for SIGINT is in the early stages of developing a capability to conduct
SIGINT support to Cyber Network Defense (CND). This support involves using SIGDEV and SIGINT systems previously
provided to DFS by NSA, such as XKEYSCORE, WEALTHYCLUSTER and CADENCE. DFS personnel assigned to support this
cyber effort have not been trained on these systems they will use to conduct this new mission; assistance from NSA
subject matter experts is needed. Supporting the development of CND within Japan aligns with NSA and the U.S.
government long-term strategic goals of bolstering the CND capabilities of partner nations with whom we share
sensitive and classified information.

(S//REL) This three-day course will provide students with an overview of what to expect when working as an analyst
within the SIGDEV environment. It looks at the entire SIGDEV process beginning with a definition of SIGDEV, who is
responsible for SIGDEV, and the vital steps in the SIGNALS Intelligence process. The course then addresses the process
starting with the initial SIGDEV requirement and follows it through the research, collection, analysis, interpretation, and
dissemination phases.

DISCUSSION:

(S//REL^^^HNSA/CSS Hawaii Technical Director for SIGDEV Strategy & Governance, has agreed to travel to
Japan to provide CSRK6000 (Third Party Version) to the Japanese from 22-26 April 2013.
