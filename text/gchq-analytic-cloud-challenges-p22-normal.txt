Technology candidates
The GCHQ "core" (Hardy)

What is it?

•	A HADOOP cluster with Map/Reduce and interactive query/analytics capabilities

•	Probably using CLOUDBASE/ACCUMULO and reusing NSA knowledge

What would it be used for?

•	A place for data and summaries promoted from the bulk stores

•	Known Target, Know Query and some Known Target, Unknown Query

•	Optimised for major use case and suitable for data sharing

•	Provides some resilience by duplicating important data

What are the challenges?

•	GCHQ has limited expertise with CLOUDBASE/ACCUMULO this technology

•	The promotion analytics and criteria are not developed

Engineering could potential build this using on-order kit
