DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Life in the Big Apple<br>FROM:<br>(S//SI) Former NSA Rep to USUN and COS NY<br>Run Date: 08/27/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>(S//SI) Former NSA Rep to USUN and COS NY <br>(S//SI) NSA has several customer representatives assigned to<br>Manhattan serving major customers such as the U.S. Ambassador<br>to the United Nations, FBI New York and the Chief of New York<br>Station. For operational reasons, our representatives are obliged to<br>live and work in Manhattan, which has both positive and not-sopositive aspects.<br>(U) Life in Manhattan is just what you might expect: fast-paced,<br>exciting, full of energy and packed with cultural opportunities. It's<br>also hectic, crowded, noisy, frustrating, and hair-raising at times,<br>particularly so since the attacks on 9/11.<br>(U) For me the charm of Manhattan is in its streets. Because cars<br>are an expensive nuisance there, many people (me included)<br>dispense with them altogether. I walked, took the bus, subway,<br>train or water taxi everywhere I went. It was a great way to get<br>around and to see New York neighborhoods, each with its distinct<br>ethnic or cultural history. The shopping is, of course, world class.<br>My midtown Manhattan apartment was only a twenty-minute walk<br>from Bloomie's, the shops on Madison, Macy's, Bergdorf's and<br>hundreds more. Broadway, Times Square and the Theater District<br>were also a short 25-minute walk from my place, very convenient<br>when the shows all finish at the same time, and you can't find a<br>cab. Walking in Soho, the East Village, across the Brooklyn Bridge<br>or farther uptown in that great green urban oasis Central Park, was<br>an inexpensive and always entertaining pastime. It always seemed<br>that there were street fairs, farmers' markets and flea markets to<br>explore. And did I mention that my commute to work consisted of a<br>five-minute walk across the street?<br>(U) New York nightlife, of course, needs no fanfare. You may<br>choose from any variety of music, theater, dance or opera with<br>venues such as Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, the Met, Broadway,<br>Birdland or CBJB's, to name just a few. Of course, major-league<br>sports venues range fromYankee Stadium and Shea to Madison<br>Square Garden and Forest Hills. Most venues are an easy subway<br>ride away. Actually, the biggest problem you face many nights is<br>deciding which restaurant to choose (8000 in Manhattan alone!),<br>ranging from good, cheap eats to world-class cuisine.<br>(S//SI) The downside for me was the expense and the noise. Living<br>in Manhattan near the U.S. Mission to the UN was an operational<br>necessity. The job required that I live within a 20-minute call-in<br>distance from the office, which practically speaking, meant living in<br>Midtown Manhattan. A modest one- or two-bedroom apartment in<br>Midtown ranges anywhere from three to four times the cost of a<br>similar place in the Maryland suburbs. Our current New York Rep<br>enjoys a housing subsidy that covers about two-thirds of the<br>housing cost, which is a significant improvement over years past<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '04 <br>1.

'Dropping Anchor' in<br>Anchorage<br><br> </p>when there was no housing compensation. New York Reps also<br>receive New York-scale compensation, which partially offsets the<br>cost of living in Manhattan. Still, life ain't cheap in the Big Apple,<br>especially for families. Also on the negative side, there is the everpresent cacophony of taxi horns, sirens and garbage trucks. As the<br>old song goes, "New York is the city that never sleeps." Now I<br>know why.<br>(U) Family and friends frequently expressed concerns about how<br>safe it was to live and work in New York. Some worried about<br>crime, others about terrorist attacks. As to crime, walking around<br>Midtown day or night felt very safe. Even late at night, there are<br>lots of people on the streets, which are well-lit and well-patrolled<br>by New York's Finest.<br>(U) The terrorist threat is something we all live with whether in the<br>Washington area, at Fort Meade and or in New York City. The news<br>is full of security precautions and arrangements that New York is<br>making in the face of the current perceived threats. It is certainly<br>nerve-wracking and intense at times to live in Manhattan, but 9/11<br>should teach us that we must all, New Yorkers and non-New<br>Yorkers alike, learn to manage the risk in our lives.<br>(U) So, was the New York tour worth the long hours, financial<br>stress, aggravation and anxiety? Absolutely! It was one of the best<br>assignments I've had, and a highlight of my career. How could a<br>chance to work at a challenging job in one of the most exciting<br>places on earth be anything less?<br>(U//FOUO) If you are thinking of applying for a field position, see<br>the Field Vacancy Announcements .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
