DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Intelligence Oversight Training -- Register Your<br>Compliance<br>FROM: <br>SID Senior Oversight Executive (SDV)<br>Run Date: 09/08/2004<br>(U//FOUO) In March of this year SID implemented a new process for meeting the annual<br>Intelligence Oversight (I/O) training requirement, offering SID employees a common way to<br>access the required reading and register their compliance. Today I am pleased to report that<br>approximately 6800 of you have already completed the process. While that number sounds<br>large, it's only 60% of our workforce. By September 30 , when we forward our results to the<br>NSA Inspector General, we want to report that we are 100% compliant.<br>(U//FOUO) Those who have not yet met the requirement may want to review the 5 W's below<br>for more information. Please note that if you have already read the documents during this fiscal<br>year (1 October 2003 through 30 September 2004), before the new process was started, you<br>are not being asked to reread them at this time. But you are asked to log in to the system and<br>register your compliance.<br>WHO : The requirement applies to ALL SID EMPLOYEES, including civilians, military, contractors<br>and integrees. In general, if your organizational designator begins with "S," you should be using<br>this process. It is not meant to supplant other systems in use at external locations. Most field<br>sites, for example, already have similar web-based systems that employees at those locations<br>should continue to use.<br>WHAT : The basic I/O training requirement is to read annually the legal documents that govern<br>our mission in SID. There are now five documents that you are asked to review:<br>Executive Order 12333,<br>USSID 18,<br>NSCID 6,<br>DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and<br>NSA Directive 10-30 (now NSA Policy 1-23).<br>The first three are the core documents covering NSA's legal authorities and restrictions and the<br>definition of SIGINT. The latter two implement the Executive Order within DoD and NSA, so it's<br>important to be familiar with them as DoD/NSA employees.<br>WHERE : The documents can be accessed via the NSA web at:<br> or via the SID homepage under:<br>"Latest News:" SID Intelligence Oversight Training. Note to those who have not yet logged in: If<br>you are civilian or military, you probably already have an account on the system, based on<br>records that were pulled from HR in February 2004, and should use your SID as an initial<br>password. You will immediately be prompted to change your password, after which you will be<br>able to log in. Contractors and those without accounts should click on the link to register for an<br>account.<br>WHEN : You may log in to the system at any time to begin. You are asked to have your reading<br>completed by the end of fiscal year, i.e., by 30 September 2004. You are not expected to read<br>all the documents at once. While the system cannot bookmark your place in each document, it<br>will keep track of each document you have completed.<br>WHY : The basic principle behind these documents is the right to privacy. Since the SID<br>mission involves electronic surveillance, it is subject to strict control under the U.S. Constitution,<br>federal law, and Executive Branch regulations designed to protect the fundamental privacy rights<br>of U.S. persons. Familiarity with the above documents is therefore an important responsibility of<br>every SID employee.<br><br> </p>(U) Thank you for your cooperation in using this new process and completing the required<br>reading as soon as possible.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any questions please contact <br><br> (<br><br>).<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
