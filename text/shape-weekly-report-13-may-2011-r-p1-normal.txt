INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE (ISAF) - AFGHANISTAN
Overview

1.	Security. The southern half of AFG is halfway through the poppy harvest and
continuing ANSF and ISAF operations have maintained pressure on insurgents (INS).
Most of the kinetic activity occurred in RC(E), although this is expected to change back to
RC(SW) towards the end of May. INS continue to avoid direct contact with ISAF and to a
lesser degree ANSF, preferring to target GIRoA.

2.	On 07 May. the INS attempted to execute their first spring offensive-related complex
attack in Kandahar City. At least 4 Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices
(SVBIED) and 14 Person Borne lEDs (PBIED) were used as the INS tried to attack nine
key GIRoA buildings* 1. Although the attack appeared more complex and better
coordinated than any previous one, it still failed to outmanoeuvre the ANSF. ISAF
intelligence reporting indicates INS commanders have expressed disappointment over the
outcome of the attack considering the amount of planning effort involved and resources
expended. The INS had 17 killed and 20 captured, resources and personnel that will be
difficult to replicate within the next few weeks.

3.	During the past winter, cache finds have been featured regularly in reporting from
Theatre. However, since March, the number of cache discoveries has decreased
significantly. Reporting indicates the INS have adjusted tactics—rather than storing
materials in a few large caches they are beginning to store smaller quantities of materials
in more dispersed locations to prevent significant loss and captures from a single ANSF or
ISAF find. Although this might make the caches harder to find, a significant disadvantage
to the INS is that it prevents caches from being readily available for large events, thereby
requiring them to control more area for effective dispersion.
