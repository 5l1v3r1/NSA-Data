(U) Topic: Iran - Current Topics, Interaction with GCHQ
(U) Director's Talking Points:

*	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Emphasize that we have successfully worked
multiple high-priority surges with GCHQ that have allowed us to refine
maintaining mission continuity and seamless transition, and maximize our target
coverage. These jointly-worked events include the storming of the British
Embassy in Tehran, Iran's discovery of FLAME, and support to policymakers
during the multiple rounds of P5 plus 1 negotiations.

(U//FOUO) SIGINT Director's Talking Points:

*	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Note that our posture on Iran will serve us well
going into any crisis or Event, but we still are taking a broader look at Iran, in die
context of a possible crisis. This year we have updated contingency plans with
GCHQ to reflect die changes in our access and Iran's capabilities.

(U) Background:

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) NS A has seen Iran further extending its influence across
the Middle East over the last year.

1.	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Iranian Cyber Attacks: Iran continues to conduct
distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks against numerous U.S. financial institutions,
and is currently in the third phase of a series of such attacks diat began in August 2012.
SIGINT indicates that these attacks are in retaliation to Western activities against Iran’s
nuclear sector and that senior officials in the Iranian government are aware of these
attacks. NS A expects Iran will continue this series of attacks, which it views as
successful, while striving for increased effectiveness by adapting its tactics and
techniques to circumvent victim mitigation attempts.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Iran's destructive cyber attack against Saudi Aramco in
August 2012, during which data was destroyed on tens of thousands of computers, was
the first such attack NS A has observed from this adversary. Iran, having been a victim of
a similar cyber attack against its own oil industry in April 2012, has demonstrated a clear
ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others. While NS A has no indications
at this time that Iran plans to conduct such an attack against a U.S. or UK target, we
cannot rule out the possibility of such an attack, especially in the face of increased
international pressure on the regime.

2.	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Iran Crisis Contingency Planning: NSA's posture on
Iran will serve us well going into any crisis or event. We continually update contingency
plans to reflect the changes in both our access and Iran’s capabilities.

*	(TS//REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA's crisis and event plans have been coordinated
throughout the U.S. IC and are designed to sync with plans at CENT COM,
EUCOM and CYBERCOM.

•	(TS//REL TO USA, FVEY) NS As planned battle rhythm focuses on production
deadlines that will feed daily briefings and intelligence requirements for policy
makers and Combatant Commands.

•	(TS//RELJjOUSAJFVEY) MEAs Iran Division has held one VTC with GCHQ's
Iran lead,^^^^H and his team, with another scheduled for 23 April to discuss
ongoing contingency planning efforts on both sides.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) NS A has successfully worked multiple high-priority
surges with GCHQ that have allowed us to refine maintaining mission continuity and
seamless transition, and maximize our target coverage. These jointly worked events
include the storming of the British Embassy in Tehran; Iran's discovery of computer
network exploitation tools on their networks in 2012 and 2013; and support to
policymakers during the multiple rounds of P5 plus 1 negotiation on Iran’s nuclear
program.

3. (TS//SI//REL TO USA, GBR) NSA-GCHQ-ISNU Trilateral Discussions: In January
2013, during an NSA-ISNU analytic workshop on Iranian Leadership, the first ever
trilateral VTC on an Iranian issue was held with NSA, GCHQ and ISNU participant^
The focus of the trilateral effort, which was kicked off by the VTC, is the^^^^^^|
theThe respective NSA-ISNU and GCHQ-ISNU
bilateral relationships had gotten to the point that each participant recognized the need for
the trilateral engagement to advance this specific topic. The trilateral relationship is
limited to the topic of^^^^^Jand will serve as a proof of concept of this kind of
engagement.

(U) Potential Landmine:

•	(TS//SI//NF) GCHQ has long advocated that it work with NSA and the ISNU in a
trilateral arrangement to prosecute the Iranian target. SID policy has been opposed
to such a blanket arrangement, and this specific trilateral should not be interpreted
as a broad change of approach. In other areas, NSA and GCHQ have agreed to
continue to share information gleaned from the respective bilateral relationships
with ISNU.
