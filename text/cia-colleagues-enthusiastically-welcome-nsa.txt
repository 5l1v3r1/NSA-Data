(S//REL) From our perspective - that of NSAers embedded within CIA's workspaces - NSA has been
a leading proponent of information sharing within the Intelligence Community. We've seen firsthand
how our CIA colleagues have enthusiastically embraced NSA's information-sharing initiatives, most
recently NSA training that is contributing greatly to the development of a cadre of CIA Target Analysts
who are capable of using SIGINT target-development information in the course of their HUMINT
efforts. This access to select SIGINT information is invaluable to CIA.

(S//REL) Upon joining FB's Liaison Support Group,recognized CIA Target Analysts'
need for formal NSA training and arranged for E9 111 him il I >in i lm	present the

course NETA200S ("Introduction to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Beyond")
to analysts in CIA's Crime & Narcotics Center (CNC). In addition to the introduction to GSM,^^^|
^^^^|also presented a demonstration of the ICREACH database. ICREACH has been identified by
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) as the U.S. Intelligence Community's
standard architecture for sharing communications metadata. The database currently provides NSA and
Second Party telephony metadata events to over 1000 analysts across 23 U.S. Intelligence Community
agencies.

(S//REL) The course was presented to CNC analysts on IB July 2010 and was so well received that

mediately coordinated	schedule another offering.

presented that second session in CIA's large auditorium on 9 September 2010 to approximately 100
very engaged CIA analysts. Given this success, FB is exploring opportunities for more formal NSA
training for our CIA customers.
