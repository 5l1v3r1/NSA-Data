The SIGINT indicated that FARC group leader Rafa was in the<br>process of finalizing an activity planned for March 30th. When the U.S. Embassy in Bogota<br>tipped Colombian authorities to the information, a team of Colombia National Police succeeded in<br>finding and arresting Rafa (true name now known to be <br>) and two<br>associates. Additional members of Rafa's group were arrested late the following day (March<br>31th).<br>(S//SI) Questioning of the suspects confirmed that they had planned to carry out assassinations<br>of Americans -- specifically U.S. Embassy Marine Security Guards -- in one of Bogota's principal<br>nightclub and entertainment districts on the night of March 30th. Based on this information,<br>Colombian National Police raided an apartment in the Suba neighborhood of Bogota and seized<br>two Walther handguns equipped with silencers and five magazines of ammunition that were<br>intended to be used in the attack. The cell phones used by Rafa and other members of the<br>group were also recovered.<br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: Congratulations to all involved in this successful<br>operation!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
