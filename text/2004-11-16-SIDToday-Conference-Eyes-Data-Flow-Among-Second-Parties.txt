DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Conference Eyes Data Flow Among Second Parties<br>FROM: <br>Chief, Data Flow and Collection Forwarding (S3C3)<br>Run Date: 11/16/2004<br><br>(S//SI) How can we ensure that data flows (i.e. data exchange of text, DNI*, voice and fax)<br>between Second Parties are operating at maximum efficiency? This was the question addressed<br>at the Data Flow Management Working Group (DFMWG) Conference held at NSAW from October<br>4-7. The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) Data Flow and Collection<br>Forwarding division served as host of the annual event, with representatives from all Five-Eyes<br>SIGINT agencies (NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB*) in attendance. Opportunities such as this<br>conference provide a forum to resolve any current problems with data exchange and ensure that<br>plans for the future are agreed upon and coordinated.<br>(S//SI) A common theme of standardization and simplification dominated much of the<br>conference discussion. Central to this standardization theme was the development of Terms of<br>Reference (TORs) for the DFMWG, which provides a common lexicon for all partners and reflects<br>strategic as well as tactical directions. An update on the Common Cryptologic Data Format<br>(CCDF) delineated the changes and upgrades on the new XML format, designed to ultimately<br>provide a standard end-to-end format for data transfers.<br>(C//SI) Participants discussed a proposal for zipcode series expansion to accommodate the<br>increase of distribution to more locations since 9/11. (Zipcode is a sequence of alphanumeric<br>characters that are used as an address for the routing of voice and fax data files.) All partners<br>agreed to the necessity of undertaking this multi-level task. Among the other topics addressed<br>were:<br>Global Network Forum (GNF) brief<br>One Number Maximum Reach<br>Mission Assurance Update<br>Global Prioritization Update<br>Shared Vision Briefing<br>SIGINT Modernization Effort at GCHQ<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to the Annual Conference, which will be held at CSE in 2005, the group<br>agreed to conduct a six-month review of progress on the actions formulated at this meeting<br>using Info WorkSpace (IWS). This added session is indicative of the growing role and<br>commitment of our Second Party partners to the interoperability of Five-Eyes data sharing and<br>the future of data flow management.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on the DFMWG conference, see the following webpage:<br><br>*(U) Notes: <br>DNI = Digital Network Intelligence <br>GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB are the SIGINT agencies for the UK, Canada, Australia, and New<br>Zealand, respectively. <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
