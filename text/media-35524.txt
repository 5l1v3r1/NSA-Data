(TS//REL) Overview

■	(TS//REL) Description: This complex element is responsible for scheduling ESP attacks.

■	(U//FOUO) Input Channel(s): incomingESPAttack

■	(S//REL) Output Channel(s): successfulESPAttack (successful attack)

■	See the poisonnut-phaseprocessing-phaseattack Maven Project.

(TS//REL) Design

(TS//REL) Capabilities

(TS//REL) Can Attack

■	(TS//REL) Description: Determines if the data that is available for the Phasel Attack is enough to do the current
attack in the attack plan. If it is not, it sets the result text and returns the cannotAttack route. The strategy is not
marked as failed, this is left for the object on the other side of the channel to decide how to handle the failure. If
no plan is set or the plan has no attacks, it returns the cannotAttack route. If there are strategies but all of them
have been exhausted, the plan will throw an IllegalStateException.

(TS//REL) Submit Attack

■	(TS//REL) Description: Creates the Attack command and submits it to the VRI with the Resource of the Attack
Strategy. The VRI correlation id must be set with the Phasel data.

(TS//REL) Submission to Output Correlator

■	(TS//REL) Description: Correlates the Phasel with it's VRI Output. The VRI Correlation id will be used for the
correlation. There will be a time out on the phasel that will indicate that we never got the VRI Output.

(TS//REL) Cancel Attack

■	(TS//REL) Description: Sends a message to the VRI that the job has been canceled.

(TS//REL) Attack Output Processor

■	(TS//REL) Description: Processes the output of the Attack. This output may not even be there if the Attack timed
out. The Attack Strategy needs to be marked as successful or failed based on the data the Attack gives back.

(TS//REL) Was Attack Successful

■	(TS//REL) Description: Checks to see if the current Attack Strategy was successful. This component could use
the Has Phasel Key Material Content Based Router implementation with a different input channel/output
channel configuration.
