A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 01/14/2004<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III <br>SID Chief of Staff <br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications:<br>This is the first "InSIDer's View of History" story.<br>See the related article for details on this series.<br>(C) In the winter of 1995-96, I was deployed to Italy in support of<br>our Balkans effort known as OPERATION JOINT ENDEAVOR. I was<br>the deputy C-2 of the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in<br>Vicenza. One of my many, many duties was to oversee the<br>preparation of target packages for contingency bombing as<br>American tanks crossed the river into Bosnia. My staff and I<br>diligently prepared these packages, which consisted mainly of<br>imagery packages with Designated Mean Point of Impact (DMPIs pronounced 'dimpy' by the Air Force guys). Our job was to select<br>targets from all three factions at the time (Serb, Croatian and<br>Muslim) that represented a range of options for the CINC, from<br>show of force through harassment to major destruction.<br>(C) Due to the uncertainty of resistance to the ground effort, the<br>CINC (we call them "Combatant Commanders" now) wanted to<br>have a total package in his hip pocket if he had to attack. There<br>had been some mistakes made in previous bombings (with civilian<br>losses) and an F-16 had been shot down so the packages had to be<br>checked and rechecked with the weaponeers and operational<br>planners. After a LOT of work we had a good set of target packages<br>for the CINC.<br>(C) One day, the CINC (General Ryan - future Chief of Staff of the<br>Air Force) showed up unannounced at my door. After I recovered<br>from the shock of seeing all those stars in my doorway, I asked<br>him how I could help him. He said he wanted to review the target<br>packages. Since there were over 100 of them, I selected about ten<br>for him to spot check (I assumed he was a busy guy). He sat right<br>down and began his review. He pored over the photos and asked<br>about the DMPIs. After an explanation he said, "I approve all the<br>DMPIs, now give me the next set." I said that he didn't have to<br>review them all since it was my job to do this for him since he is<br>busy, etc. If you know General Ryan at all, you will not be<br>surprised by his immediate reaction.<br>(C) As I was put at the position of attention, I was given a lesson in<br>personal responsibly. The CINC explained that warfare had made a<br>fundamental change - that commanders had a legal responsibility<br>in the war crimes sense. If a mistake is made, there was the real<br>possibility of a war crimes charge in the climate of the Balkans war.<br>The CINC was bound and determined that no one below him would<br>be responsible. So he wanted to personally approve every DMPI. It<br>became a long day and a learning experience for me. It really<br>brought home the concepts of responsibility and accountability.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.  InSIDer's View of<br>History ...

The<br>planning cycle for dropping a bomb has compressed from a day to<br>minutes and the criterion for the aiming point has less and less<br>review. As many of you know, our forces in Iraq are dropping<br>bombs on the strength of SIGINT alone. We are proud of their<br>confidence in us, but have you ever considered the enormous risk<br>the commanders are assuming in this regard? Are you ready to<br>share that risk? Makes you think about how critical your best<br>efforts are.<br><br>12.  In SID er's View of<br>History : Quite a<br>Welcome!<br>13.

In the past we may have traded quality for speed. That<br>equation doesn't hold any more. We are in the business of saving<br>lives and we mainly think of it as alerting the good guys to the bad<br>guys and targeting them, but it also means being aware of the<br>location of the good guys (to prevent fratricide) and more and<br>more an awareness of the non-combatants (to prevent the tragedy<br>of killing the innocents). Ask yourself this question: Am I doing my<br>very best? Our success and their lives depend on the answer.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
