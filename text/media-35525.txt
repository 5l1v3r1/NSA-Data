(UHFOUO) VALIANTSURF: TURMOIL GALLANTWAVE

Ha me in portlnel Ivery Pia nel'leat Andi Itectu 4am leper:

(UHFOUO) The TURMOIL CIET (Common Internet Technologies) Thrust's mission is to ensure that the GALLANTWAVE team's TURMOIL-related requiremean are fulfilled. Two sub-projecLs under CIET are
VALIANTSURF and GALLANTWAVE.

(TSHSIHREL) GALLANTWAVE (CW) is a CES Mission Application hosted on TURMOIL that enables exploitation of target communications that employ Data Network Session Cipher (DNSC) technologies. The GALLANTWAVE
mission application integrates with solutions at the front end. After interacting with TS's LONGHAUL key recovery service via ISLANDTRANSPORT, it exploits the cipher at the front end, exposing the
plain text to follow-on selection and collection.

(SHSIHREL) Information revealing any capability NSA has to exploit a speci?c target?s or company?s implementation of for GALLANTWAVE technologies is BULLRUN.

GALLANTWAVE Detailed Description

(TSHSIHREL) GALLANTWAVE (CW) implements TML Stage 1 PPF graphs (1 per host) with dedicated instances of the TechPromote and the CW PPF graphs identify and promote DNSC packets that
meet criteria speci?ed in a Rules.cfg file. graph subsequently sessionizes the selected traf?c, injecLs control-?ow metadata, and forwards targeted DNSC Sessi ns to a CW mission-application hosted on a
CA Server. The GW?CAServer interacts with SCARLET FEVER (a CES LONGHAUL component) to transform those sessions for IP?addresses within a approved set of target IP?addresses. The GW?CAServer transformed sessions
are sent to XKEYSCORE via a modified TURMOIL XKS-SESSIONS graph for session processing, strong-selection, and forwarding to follow-on processing systems and Corporate Repositories.
