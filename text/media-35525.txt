(U//FOUO) The TURMOIL CIET (Common Internet Encryption Technologies) Thrust's mission is to ensure that the GALLANTWAVE team's TURMOIL-related requirements are fulfilled. Two sub-projects under CIET are
VALIANTSURF and GALLANTWAVE.

(TS//SI//REL) GALLANTWAVE (GW) is aCES Mission Application hosted on TURMOIL that enables exploitation of target communications that employ Data Network Session Cipher (DNSC) technologies. The GALLANTWAVE
mission application integrates with TURBULENCE-based solutions at the front end. After interacting with T5's LONGHAUL key recovery service via ISLANDTRAN SPORT, it exploits the cipher at the front end. exposing the
plain text to follow-on selection and collection.

BULLRUN

(S//SI//REL) Information revealing any capability NSA has to exploit a specific target's or company's implementation of encryption for GALLANTWAVE technologies is BULLRUN.

GALLANTWAVE Detailed Description

(TS//SI//REL) GALLANTWAVE (GW) implements TML Stage 1 PPF graphs (1 per host) with dedicated instances of the TechPromote (GWAeg) and the PSPSeg (GWSeg). GW PPF graphs identify and promote DNSC packets that
meet criteria specified in a Rules.cfg hie. A TE GALLANTWAVE graph subsequently sessionizes the selected traffic, injects control-flow metadata, and forwards targeted DNSC Sessions to a GW mission-application hosted on a
CA Server. The GW-CAServer interacts with SCARLET FEVER (a CES LONGHAUL component) to transform those sessions for IP-addresses within an approved set of target IP-addresses. The GW-CAServer transformed sessions
are sent to XKEYSCORE via a modified TURMOIL XKS-SESSIONS graph for session processing, strong-selection, and forwarding to follow-on processing systems and Corporate Repositories.
