Operation IRONPERSISTENCE

ATO Support to DIA and TF 3-10 in Afghanistan

Ongoing

DIA approached EAO-AF about a source with
access to some key Taliban targets in
Afghanistan. These targets are two of TF 3-10’s
highest priority targets.

EAO-Washington coordinated with DIA as well
as ATO’s MX Team, Bridging and Exploitation
Division, and Persistence Division to create the
proper tool that addresses the target’s sensitive
OPSEC practices.

CNE enabled devices have since been forward
deployed to Afghanistan to be used against this
target. The devices will be delivered as soon as
the source can schedule a meeting with the Task
Force Target.
