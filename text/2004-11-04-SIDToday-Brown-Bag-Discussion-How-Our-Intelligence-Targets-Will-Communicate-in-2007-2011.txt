Our presentation will be the culmination of months of research and analysis in support<br>of SID's annual budget build -- all aimed at helping to posture SID against strategic surprise.<br>We rely heavily on the expertise of A&amp;P target offices, DA technologists, 2nd Party, Community<br>and Field experts, private industry, and academia. We also use all source material to track the<br>indicators of change in the current and planned usage of technologies by our targets. The<br>stronger the target evidence, the more certain SID is that its technology developments and<br>investments are on track. This talk will provide information on our analytical methodologies as<br>well as the information that you need to know to track your intelligence targets and prepare<br>your anticipatory developments.<br>(U//FOUO) Registration : To register for this event, please send an e-mail to "dl sdconf" (or<br>sdconf@nsa) indicating your interest or call <br> and ask for either <br> or <br>.
