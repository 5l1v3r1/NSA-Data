SOTF Problems

Can an sotf_input_proc run with a file_based
file_input_proc?

• Yes. Both input types can run on XKEYSCORE given that
each are independently configured correctly.

■ Can file-based input be disabled so that only
sotfjnput is processed?

•	If moving from file-based input to sotfjnput, and no
additional file-based input is expected, the plug-in for file-
based input, db_input_file_handler, should be disabled.

•	From the TERMINAL WINDOW:

►	Stop all the processes : xks stop all

►	Change /opt/xkeyscore/config/xks.config to set fllejnput to ‘no’.

►	Setup the config : xks setup plugins, xks setup processes

►	Rsync change to slaves : xks rsync push_config

►	Restart process_data’s : xks proc restart pdp
