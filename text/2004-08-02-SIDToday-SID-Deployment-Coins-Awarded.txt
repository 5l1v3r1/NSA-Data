DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) SID Deployment Coins Awarded<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 08/02/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) On Tuesday, July 27, at a ceremony in the Friedman Auditorium, MG Quirk thanked<br>SIGINTers who returned from deployment to hostile areas between 1 Jan 04 and 31 May 04.<br>(U) We asked a few of those who received this recognition to tell us where they went, what they<br>did and to give us their impression of the event. Here is what they had to say:<br>(U) "I was very impressed with the fact that MG Quirk took the time to speak at the ceremony<br>personally. That shows how much SID has valued and supported these deployments."<br>(U) "I was particularly glad that the ceremony combined agency civilian and military employees<br>who had deployed together with the same mission and goals. The ceremony was a great<br>opportunity to see fellow OIF/OEF "alumni" and celebrate the fact that we have all returned<br>safely. It's obvious that a lot of time and care were taken to prepare unique certificates and<br>coins rather than the standard SID coins. This certificate will hang on my office wall for the next<br>fifty years until I retire, when I will still be telling stories about the best experience of my<br>career."<br>(U) "I was a civilian Intelligence Analyst deployed to CSG Baghdad from October 2003 through<br>February 2004."<br>(U//FOUO) "I thought the ceremony was nice, short and very personal. Starting out with the<br>national anthem was very moving as we all strive to keep our nation safe. MG Quirk's opening<br>remarks made me proud of what I do and of my most recent deployment. When my turn to walk<br>across the stage came, I felt a bit nervous since this was the first time I had met MG Quirk.<br>When I shook his hand, received the certificate and coin, and heard him thanking me for my<br>sacrifice, I felt so proud. The certificate is a real nice one and yes I have already put it on my<br>desk. Also, <br> and<br> were recognized for their support in the travel office<br>... that was well deserved!<br>(U) "My most recent deployment was from March-May 2004 into Iraq as a signals expert,<br>conducting surveys."<br>(U//FOUO) "With folks being deployed from all parts of the Enterprise it was really great to see<br>many who were in Iraq at the same time I was. SID really went the distance to make it a quality<br>ceremony. The slide show presented prior to the formal ceremony was a collection of shots of<br>the places and surroundings where folks had been deployed. That combined with seeing people I<br>was deployed with really brought back the experience. The certificate is a keeper because it's<br>not one of those black-lettered-on-white-background-check-the-block-certificates. Someone<br>spent some time putting a nice statement of thanks and recognition from MG Quirk over a photo<br>of gun waving, RPG toting radicals. It's up on my office wall already. What really made it<br>outstanding was when MG Quirk recognized <br>and <br>in SID Travel. They<br>certainly deserve recognition for the quality support they provided to us while we were<br>deployed."<br>(U) "I was the Chief of the CSG in Baghdad from January into May."<br>(U) "I thought it was a nice ceremony and a great opportunity for folks who had a tough job in a<br>difficult environment to get recognized. I was thoroughly impressed with all the NSAers I worked<br>with in Iraq and was glad to see them receive a coin from MG Quirk. It was like a mini Iraq<br>reunion in the Friedman yesterday."<br><br> </p>(TS//SI) "I spent 2-1/2 months in Baghdad (that was my 3rd trip to Iraq in the last year) as OIC<br>of the Office of Target &amp; Reconnaissance (OTRS) Forward Operating Base (FOB). We had a seven<br>member team stationed out of the VVIP terminal at Baghdad International Airport and were<br>heavily involved with exploiting the emerging Iraqna GSM network, Wireless LAN, GOSSAMER<br>Operations and Syrian GSM bleed-over surveys."<br>(U) As noted in the announcement of the ceremony on SIDtoday , additional ceremonies will be<br>held quarterly.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
