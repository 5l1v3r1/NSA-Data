The main thrust of this talk will cover Confabulation (outlined in pages 2-11 in the<br>document below).<br>(U) Here is a summary of confabulation quoted from the paper referenced below:<br>"The main research program of Artificial Intelligence has been to find some sort of reasoning<br>process that can account for animal cognition. Confabulation, a symbolic prediction technique<br>introduced here, is the antithesis of this program. Instead of trying to reason from assumed<br>facts to conclusions, it uses a strange from of knowledge to rule out unreasonable outcomes;<br>leaving a core set of not-unreasonable possibilities is called an expectation. Then, employing the<br>same knowledge in a different way, it identifies the highest quality conclusions in the<br>expectation. Unlike reasoning, which must employ highly refined and specific knowledge that is<br>difficult and expensive to obtain, confabulation uses a type of knowledge (conditional<br>probabilities between pairs of symbols) that is simple and easy to obtained in the required vast<br>quantities. The recently discovered neuronal Marder/Turigiano/Hebb learning principle produces<br>this kind of knowledge. Confabulation is proposed as the underlying mechanism of all vertebrate<br>cognition."<br>(U) Dr. Hecht-Nielsen proposes that these discoveries will profoundly impact how artificial<br>intelligence techniques are applied to a wide variety of problems.<br>(U) The Institute for Neural Computation's external Web site is: http://inc2.ucsd.edu<br>(U) Dr. Hecht-Nielsen's Paper can be accessed on the external Web at :<br>http://inc2.ucsd.edu/pdfs/UCSD_INC_TechReport0401.pdf<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br><br> </p>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
