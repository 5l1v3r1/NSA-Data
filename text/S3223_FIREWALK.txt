(TS//SI//REL) FIREWALK is a bi-directional 10/100/1000bT (Gigabit) Ethernet network
implant residing within a dual stacked RJ45 / USB connector. FIREWALK is capable of
filtering and egressing network traffic over a custom RF link and injecting traffic as
commanded; this allows a ethernet tunnel (VPN) to be created between target network and
the ROC (or an intermediate redirector node such as DNT's DANDERSPRITZ tool.)
FIREWALK allows active exploitation of a target network with a firewall or air gap protection.
(TS//SI//REL) FIREWALK uses the HOWLERMONKEY transceiver for back-end
communications. It can communicate with an LP or other compatible HOWLERMONKEY
based ANT products to increase RF range through multiple hops.
