DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Data Acquisition Meets With Extended Enterprise<br>FROM:<br>SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)<br>Run Date: 05/12/2004<br>FROM: <br>SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3) <br>(C) Last week, Data Acquisition held the first of what will be a series of video-teleconferences<br>(VTCs) with field sites around the world. Participating were those sites identified as having<br>predominently collection actvities in the Director's 15 January 2004 Agency-all message "The<br>Extended Enterprise: Where to From Here?" These sites include:<br>Menwith Hill Station, Field Station Denver, and the Joint Defence Facility, Pine Gap;<br>collection sites in Korea and Thailand;<br>the Misawa Security Operations Center;<br>the Alaska Mission Operation Center at Elmendorf, Alaska;<br>CONUS collection sites at Yakima, Washington, and Sugar Grove, West Virginia;<br>the Special Collection Service; and<br>the Technical Centers in the Pacific and Europe.<br>To accomodate the multiple time zones involved, we held an early morning (local time) VTC for<br>sites in the Pacific and Far East, followed by one at lunchtime for sites across the U.S. and in<br>Europe.<br>(U//FOUO) This initial VTC provided the sites with an overview of Data Acquisition's plans for<br>governance of the Extended Enterprise, our strategy, and how we build the budget. It gave them<br>a preview of upcoming events in which the field might be interested, and introduced the Data<br>Acquisition Extended Enterprise team, which will be the field's primary interface at the DA-level.<br>The VTC also provided the first opportunity for field site commanders to let the Deputy Director<br>for Data Acquisition know directly what is of interest to them.<br>(U//FOUO) While all of the sites have individual issues and concerns, some common themes<br>emerged from the discussion: Field sites are looking forward to and see great value in working<br>with DA in its new advocacy role, and expect this new relationship to provide them with insight<br>into and opportunities to participate in strategy and budget development activities, schedules,<br>and decision points. It also affords us opportunities to provide field sites with improved visibility<br>into internal coordination within DA and SID, which will help us identify and avoid areas where<br>disconnects are likely to occur and limit any adverse impacts on sites' operations. The sites are<br>eager to reach a decision on processes - either to use those that already exist or to put new<br>ones in place where there are gaps. Communication - how, how often, and when - is widely<br>viewed as a key attribute of this endeavor: the field had a number of suggestions on what would<br>be most beneficial to them.<br>(U//FOUO) As we continue to step up to our role in managing the extended enterprise, our plans<br>now include a series of site-specific or topic-specific VTCs, at which we can gather together the<br>right audience to address sites' concern and provide further information on upcoming initiatives<br>that will affect their facilities and missions. We are also planning periodic visits by DA<br>management to each of the sites to allow face-to-face discussions and better familiarization with<br>their issues. The feedback from the sites on the VTC has been positive and constructive - the<br>open discussion and sites' willingness to work with us are good first steps in fulfilling the<br>Director's goal.<br>(U//FOUO) See related articles: <br>SIGINT and the Question of Governance <br>Director's Paper on the Extended Enterprise: What It Means for SID<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
