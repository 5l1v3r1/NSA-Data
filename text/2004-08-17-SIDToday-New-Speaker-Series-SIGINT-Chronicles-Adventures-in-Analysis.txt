DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) New Speaker Series SIGINT Chronicles: Adventures in Analysis<br>FROM: <br> &amp; Kara Grimaldi<br>SIGINT Chronicles Series Organizers<br>Run Date: 08/17/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) Intelligence Analysis Development Program participants recently kicked off a new<br>speaker series: SIGINT Chronicles: Adventures in Analysis . Its aim is to be an informal<br>venue for NSA employees, past and present, to share their experiences with junior employees in<br>a casual setting. There are a lot of tool courses out there, but little that captures the human art<br>of analysis or the strong NSA analytic tradition. The IA Skill Community, the Advanced Analytic<br>Lab and the Center for Cryptologic History all provided support for the event, which was the<br>product of an offhand remark that someone recognized as a good idea.<br>(S//SI) Milt Zaslow, an NSA legend and our first speaker, built analysis from the bottom up<br>during the Korean and Vietnam wars. His hour with us discussing the art of analysis against new<br>enemies with unfamiliar tactics was inspiring and encouraging. As one attendee commented,<br>"It's great for us young whippersnappers to hear from someone who's been there and done<br>that. I think we can really use those voices of experience to help form our own effective method<br>of tracking our current and future adversaries." (For more on Mr. Zaslow's talk, see The 'Good<br>Old Days' .)<br>(U//FOUO) Information on this series and announcements for future presentations can be found<br>on the SIGINT Chronicles webpage. The next talk will be given by <br> Co-Lead of<br>MENA SRTD Telephony and Geospatial Analysis Team, on September 7th.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
