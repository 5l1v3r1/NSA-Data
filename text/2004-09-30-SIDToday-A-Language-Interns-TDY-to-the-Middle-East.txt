That's because there I was<br>seated in the second row of one of the Middle East's best preserved Roman amphitheatres,<br>listening to the Syrian National Sympthony and a group of opera singers from Italy performing<br>portions of Carmen. And how did I get there? I was there because I had been given the chance<br>to serve with F6 on TDY to Damascus.<br> <br>Roman Amphitheater in Bosra, Syria <br>(S//SI) I say, "given the chance," because for me it was the best experience I have had so far as<br>an NSA language-analyst intern. After all, not only was I travelling to an exotic country on<br>someone else's dime, but I was also getting the opportunity to expand my professional<br>experience immensely and go sight-seeing in my time off.<br>(S) On the professional side, deploying with F6 meant that I got to see first-hand the front end<br>of SIGINT collection. But beyond that, I was able to work not only with a professionally diverse<br>group of SIGINT colleagues at the site, but also with a range of professionals from different parts<br>of the intelligence community. In this way, the experience was like getting a up-close look of<br>the intelligence community in miniature: the kind of view that many an intern won't get in a<br>year at headquarters.<br>(S) Of course, "all work and no play," as the saying goes. So I also made the most of my being<br>in Damascus -- reputed to be the oldest, continously inhabited city in the world. Besides the<br>city's museums, souqs, and artist studios, there were plenty of things to see throughout the<br>country. Imagine Palymra with its acres and acres of ancient ruins or Apamea where the<br>surviving Roman road is still faced with 600 columns and ancient shop fronts.<br> <br>Apamea <br>(S) I spent 40 days in Syria and took full advantage of the great opportunity given me. My<br>perspective as a professional was greatly broadened, and my memories as a tourist were out of<br>this world. That's why I say that I was "given the chance" to go, and that's why, if you were<br>given the chance, I'd tell you to pack your bags and get ready to have a great time.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
