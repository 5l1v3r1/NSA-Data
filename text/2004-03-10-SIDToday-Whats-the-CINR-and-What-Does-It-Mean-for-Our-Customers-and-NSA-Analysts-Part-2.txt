(Part 2)<br>FROM:<br>Chief, Reporting Board (S21A)<br>Run Date: 03/10/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>Chief, Reporting Board (S21A) <br>(U//FOUO) This is part 2 (and final) of <br><br> article. If you missed it, see Part 1 .<br><br>(U//FOUO) The IN and LOE Structure Project Teams are exploring a request format that is<br>logical, binned, allows for tracking, and contains standard language while still providing for<br>individual comments.<br>(U//FOUO) The common language for INs will be based upon the National Intelligence Priorities<br>Framework (NIPF) as described in Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 2/3 , dated<br>23 July 2003. The NIPF provides the President's priorities for the Intelligence Community,<br>described in geographic, topic, sub-topic format. The NIPF structure will facilitate research and<br>reduce duplication of needs submitted.<br>(U//FOUO) The Products and Services Project Team is developing an accepted list of all products<br>and services NSA produces or provides to customers.<br>(U//FOUO) The Process Logic Team recently developed a high-level description of the flow of<br>information requests from the customer entry to NSA through the SIGINT production cycle. A<br>follow-on team will vet the flow and provide operational needs.<br>(U//FOUO) The teams are making great progress; that progress is being vetted with our<br>stakeholders, customers and analysts to ensure that we're on the right track. At the same time,<br>the process owners in CRD, A&amp;P, and DA are determining how current tools and programs fit<br>into the new process flows, and identifying gaps and solutions. Implementation of solutions will<br>be incremental and will evolve over time.<br>(U//FOUO) The project sounds ambitious, and it is. But we believe our goals are achievable and<br>can transform our business processes, better serve our customers, and help return valuable<br>analytic time to analysis.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
