Mr.<br>Jordan explained that the NVTC is a work in progress but is already successfully<br>achieving its mission. It was created by congressional legislation as an official part of the<br>Intelligence Community, and became fully operational on July 31st. Its leadership is drawn from<br>the IC client agencies, with the FBI serving as the center's executive agent and the ADCI/A&amp;P*<br>providing mission guidance.<br>(U) "What makes the Center work," explained Jordan, "is the center is both national and virtual.<br>People all over the country are working on documents in secure facilities when necessary, and<br>on their home computers when they work on unclassified." Jordan stated the unclassified portion<br>amounted to roughly half of the total. Despite the large portion of unclassified work, all<br>employees of the NVTC must be US persons and must undergo an investigation. FBI, as the<br>executive agent of the NVTC, conducts the background investigations for the NVTC employees<br>and provides other administrative support.<br>(U//FOUO) "This is a great opportunity for retired NSA employees. They can live in Florida and<br>make some extra money in their robe and slippers. And they are helping their country," claimed<br>Jordan. In addition to the opportunity for retired employees, Jordan discussed the waiver that<br>has passed allowing current NSA employees to work at the NVTC in their leisure time -- just as<br>they might work somewhere else, like The Home Depot. The work is on an "at-will and asavailable" basis, so a consistent work schedule is not necessary.<br>(U) In its first 18 months, the NVTC has established itself and become operational. In the next<br>18 months, Jordan foresees it solidifying its position and fine-tuning its operations. He wants to<br>have qualified linguists "lined up and waiting," even for obscure languages that may suddenly<br>leap to the forefront of importance.<br>(U) Aside from the translation work, Jordan described what it's like to work with other members<br>of the Intelligence Community. He alluded to the unique jargon each individual agency uses in<br>its operations, saying this was a "language" challenge of its own for the NVTC. "It's been quite<br>an experience [building the NVTC]. I just buckled my seatbelt and held on tight!" Starting from<br>scratch, Jordan and his staff had to create an identity for the NVTC from the ground up -- even<br>including the need invent a logo for the organization. He considers this groundbreaking work the<br>best job he's ever had in his career.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>ADCI/A&amp;P = Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Analysis &amp; Production<br>(U) For more information on the NVTC, see its Internet web page at: http://www.nvtc.gov.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
