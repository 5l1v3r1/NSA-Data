Understanding<br>the target's social network enhances and enables intelligence<br>production.<br>(U) The Target Analysis Center's Social Network Analysis<br>Workcenter (SNAW) is developing an integrated Social Network<br>Analysis methodology supporting event analysis within the SIGINT<br>community. SNA includes information on actors (people,<br>organizations, companies, etc), attributes (facts about or<br>properties of actors), relations (socially meaningful ties across<br>actors), and metadata (from information source). By mapping and<br>analyzing the pattern of social interactions ('works with', 'knows',<br>'receives money from', etc.) between individuals, SNA illuminates<br>the scope, complexity, and structure of networks, and the roles<br>individuals play within them.<br>(U) SNA can provide an overview or "organizational snapshot" of a<br>target organization and show the degree of 'interconnectedness' of<br>the target organization and its individuals. Key individuals who play<br>significant social roles can be identified. This, in turn, supports<br>SIGINT Development efforts and potentially highlights exploitable<br>weaknesses in targets for the target analyst.<br>(U) Understanding the character and behavior of key individuals<br>within the mission area also supports military operations planning<br>and execution. Additionally, SNA may provide metrics for Measures<br>of Effectiveness (MOEs) within a campaign.<br>(U) The SNA Workcenter is also charged with capturing and<br>translating the analyst's information needs into valid requirements<br>that enhance the total target analytic results.<br>(U) Here is just one example of how work in this division leads to<br>intelligence:<br>(TS//SI) SNAW Supports SSIO Project : SNAW analyst continued to<br>work with members of the SIGINT Support to Information<br>Operations (SSIO), Foreign Information Operations Threat Division<br>(S2K1) to support an SNA project on the Mujahedin-E-Kalq (MEK)<br>terrorist group in Iraq. SNAW provided initial analyses and<br>visualizations for the MEK project to help refine analytic<br>hypotheses and focus on potential high-value areas for analytic<br>exploitation. This project will contribute to an in-depth SIGINT<br>assessment report on the MEK and should provide insight on<br>numerous aspects of the target, including its power structure and<br>potential avenues for influence. <br> CON,<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SIGINT Development <br>1.
