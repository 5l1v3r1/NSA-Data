In<br>addition to that, we've had Issue Management Teams for a few years now. Some may not fully<br>understand how all of these positions interrelate, or the "lanes in the road" regarding their<br>responsibilities, and some clarification may be in order.<br>(U//FOUO) First, let's look at the Issue Management Teams . Each IMT is charged with being<br>SID's conscience to synchronize and optimize the performance of the USSS against its target<br>area. What does that mean? It means they look across the entire spectrum of how we approach<br>a target and consider where we can make improvements.<br>(U//FOUO) When I say "entire spectrum," I mean they involve themselves in everything from<br>policy questions, to training, to budgets, to any operational aspect of how we work a target.<br>Once they've found a shortfall or an opportunity to improve, they meet with SID leadership to<br>plot a course of action. The IMTs are advocates and proponents of activities, but they are not<br>themselves managers. Rather, they identify problems and work with managers (in S1, S2, S3,<br>enabling organizations, etc.) to solve them.<br>(U//FOUO) Next, there's Lonny Anderson, SID's Associate Deputy Director for<br>Counterterrorism, and the CT-Mission Management Center that he leads. Lonny, on behalf<br>of SID leadership, synchronizes the worldwide CT mission and has the license to "make things<br>happen" on that target. He is responsible for establishing links across the CT mission area. We<br>created this position because the target is of such great importance that we need a dedicated<br>SID-level leader focused on it full-time. He is an advocate for this mission, making sure we have<br>the tools and resources needed to prosecute this target, and operates in partnership with those<br>working CT issues within the Deputy Directorates.<br>(U//FOUO) The CT-MMC (see related article , now being formed, will be located next to NSOC to<br>allow for close collaboration between the two. The CT-MMC will steer time-sensitive and longterm CT activities around the globe.<br>(U//FOUO) The Counterterrorism IMT remains in place. Its members are looking strategically at<br>performance across the board -- including that of the CT-MMC. In this way, they'll serve as a<br>conscience for Lonny and the SID leadership, who will use them to look beyond current<br>operations at the "big picture."<br>(U//FOUO) Lastly there are the Global Capabilities Managers . How are they different from<br>IMT's? For one, the IMT's operate at the SID level, while the GCM's work for S2 (A&amp;P;).<br>Accordingly they are focused exclusively on analysis and production issues worldwide. Also,<br>while the IMT's serve as a conscience to advise and consult, the GCM's directly manage the work<br>force in the production of SIGINT, making sure everyone's talents are being used effectively. The<br>word "global" in their title highlights the fact that they look beyond Fort Meade to oversee<br>production at the Cryptologic Centers (formerly RSOCs) and other SIGINT production entities<br>around the world. GCM's can also influence Second and Third Parties regarding the mission.<br>Conclusion<br>(U//FOUO) As you can see, each of the above positions serves a different function. Having said<br>that, there is some degree of overlap in responsibilities, and that is intentional. We would rather<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">have a slight overlap than have things "fall between the cracks." Clearly, this is a less<br>hierarchical approach than some may be used to, and I see this trend continuing as part of our<br>effort to achieve a net-centric cryptologic system. Good communication among all parties is the<br>key to everything running smoothly.<br>(U//FOUO) I should point out that these changes are not meant to "fix something that's<br>broken." The SIGINT System is a remarkable machine that saves lives every day. These<br>positions are intended to make that system even better in the future.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
