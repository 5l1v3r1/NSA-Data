•	(S//SI//REL FVEY) Communications must be confirmed foreign-to-
foreign.

•	(S//SI //REL FVEY) Filters at front-ends to ensure only authorized traffic
is forwarded to the DNR and DNI selection engines.

•	(S//SI //REL FVEY) Occasionally the TOPI discovers that one end of the
intercept is actually in the US. We refer to this as a “domestic incident”.

•	(C) TOPI’s must inform SSO Corp Team when this occurs via email alias
^^^■SSO files a formal report to NSA/SV for each occurrence of
a domestic incident.
