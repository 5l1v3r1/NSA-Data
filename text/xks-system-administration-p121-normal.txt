■ Is XKEYSCORE receiving input?

•	To verify whether XKEYSCORE is receiving input,
run the sotf_stat command to get the current
input statistics.

•	If no connection is visible, from the command line:

1.	Type telnet localhost 5042

2.	Output statistics for the specified sotf_dist

3.	If running, type ps -ef | grep sotf_dist

4.	Determine if sotf_dist’s are listening on the
specified port:

Type telnet localhost 5040

If command is refused, the sotf_dist is not listening on the port.
Continue with step 5.

5.	Type netstat -a | grep 5040

If a connection is established for this port then most
likely the sotf_dist is listening on this port.
