DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Generally Speaking: Supporting the Tactical Units<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 09/02/2004<br><br>(S//REL) Over the last few months, we have made significant progress in<br>improving our SIGINT support to tactical elements in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>"Tactical elements" refers to the division, brigade and battalion level -- this is<br>where information is turned into military operations. Although in the past we've done well in<br>supporting commanders at higher military echelons, it became clear to us this spring that<br>SIGINT was largely absent where the "rubber meets the road" and we needed to do more. Our<br>objective was not only to get more usable intelligence to that level, but also to tie forwarddeployed forces into the global SIGINT system. We still have a long way to go in this effort, but<br>here is an update on what we have accomplished:<br>(S//REL) As explained in the Director's WARgram-62 ("NSA/CSS Transforming National-Tactical<br>Integration in Iraq") of 2 June, NSA launched a three-part initiative to make this happen. Where<br>do we stand now?<br>(U) First Initiative: Effect improvements to SECRET reporting to division level and below<br>(C//REL) The standard information system used at these echelons is SIPRNet, which contains<br>information at the straight-SECRET level, including sanitized SIGINT reports. SID has<br>undertaken training to help SIGINT reporters get the most actionable information possible into<br>their tear-lines. In addition, although these reports can be "pulled" from SIPRNet, we have now<br>added a "push" method of dissemination by emailing our tear-line reports directly to divisionand-below intelligence personnel. This is only a first step -- we must continue to find ways to<br>improve the tearline dissemination process and to make it a routine part of our business. More<br>importantly, we must continue to refine and improve the quality and utility of our tearline<br>reporting, to ensure that critical information gets to the folks who need it.<br>(U//FOUO) Second Initiative: Establish TSSI/NSANet connectivity to brigade level and<br>upgrade tactical collection systems<br>(S//REL) NSA has purchased equipment that allows soldiers in the field 2-way access to NSANet,<br>and we are deploying it to every division in Iraq and to some in Afghanistan. Tactical forces can<br>now communicate directly with experts located throughout the SIGINT Enterprise to share<br>information -- just the synergy we wanted to achieve. The equipment also includes collection<br>systems that can be tuned locally or from Fort Meade! There are now 14 suites -- manned by<br>analysts and linguists -- currently operating in Iraq. The Tactical Platforms Division (S3314)<br>within Radio Frequency Operations, ACO (Army Cryptologic Operations) and NTIO (the National<br>Tactical Integration Office - S14) have done a great job making this happen. Again, we have a<br>long way to go, but we are off to a good start.<br>(U//FOUO) Third Initiative: Deploy "national presence" at divisions to provide valueadded SIGINT analysis and national reach-back<br>(S//REL) An Army division is composed of roughly 20,000 troops. In the past, each division<br>would include a staff of 50 or so SIGINT analysts; now, however, this number has been reduced<br>to just 6 or 7. NSA has deployed Cryptologic Support Teams (CSTs) to augment these small<br>division staffs, working side-by-side with them to improve their capabilities. Each CST consists of<br>4-5 military and civilian SIGINT analysts who disseminate SIGINT, explain what it means, and<br>provide linkage back to NSA and the rest of the SIGINT Enterprise. Some CSTs are up and<br>running, and the remainder will be in place by 10 September. I am already receiving praise from<br>commanders who recognize the impact these CSTs are having. We will provide this support for a<br>two-year period, after which the military division staffs will be ready to take over the mission.<br><br> </p>(S//REL) Hopefully, these are just the beginnings of a great success story. We identified a<br>problem, made quick decisions, provided sufficient funding (the Director authorized $30 million<br>for this effort), and moved out! We must continue the momentum and follow through to provide<br>the support that tactical units need.<br>(S//REL) I congratulate everyone here at Fort Meade contributing to this effort, and a special<br>thanks to those who volunteered to deploy to Iraq with the CSTs. They'll tell their grandchildren<br>about it someday.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
