Within the Air Force assignment system, once<br>you complete a short tour you are assigned back to the United<br>States, so many Chinese and Korean linguists found themselves<br>assigned to Goodfellow AFB to assist in "curriculum development."<br>(U) Curriculum development -- i.e. support to intelligence training - encompassed everything from vault monitors and secure area<br>management (weeds &amp; seeds/burn/mulch operator) to building<br>managers. As a Secure Area Manager, I recall many occasions of<br>being covered in a white powdery substance while trying to<br>"unclog" the two-story mulching machine. Needless to say, it<br>wasn't what I had envisioned as a young Chinese Linguist but it<br>gave me an incredible appreciation of the resourcefulness of the<br>fellow NCOs (Non-commissioned Officers) I worked with.<br>(U) A classic example was the impending visit of General Lawrence<br>Oaks, the Air Force Commander of the Air Education Training<br>Commander (AETC). This was General Oaks' first visit to<br>Goodfellow AFB, so the base commander wanted to make a good<br>impression. General Oaks liked the color brown, so everything was<br>painted brown, the rocks along the main gate, the building walls,<br>even the mail boxes (much to the postmaster's dismay). On a side<br>note: we also painted the brown grass green.<br>(U) Finally, the big day arrived. The commanders from the entire<br>base gathered in front of the Entry Control Point to escort the<br>General through the secure area. Col James O'Brien, Wing<br>Commander, noticed the doormat leading into Building 519 was<br>"not suitable for a General." Immediately, Secure Area Managers<br>Sgt Terry Wilson and Sgt Bob Raley (both Chinese Linguists)<br>sprang into action. Placing airmen at strategic points along the<br>general's route to provide situational awareness, the two NCOs<br>grabbed the brand-new doormat from the Wing Commander's<br>entrance, moved it to the main entrance and continued to move<br>the mat throughout the General's visit, based on the intelligence<br>gleaned from the forward-deployed airmen.<br>(U) Having been deployed to Saudi Arabia for Desert<br>Calm/Operation Southern Watch, and in a variety of operational<br>situations, I do not think I have seen a better use of intelligence.<br>The information was timely, accurate, and actionable. The<br>integration of SIGINT, HUMINT, and IMINT would make an Air<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.  InSIDer's View of<br>History ...
