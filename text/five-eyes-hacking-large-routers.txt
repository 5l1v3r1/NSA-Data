(TS//SI//REL) Happy Friday my esteemed and valued Intelligence Community colleagues! There has been a topic of conversation that has started to rumble beneath the
surface of the Cyber-scene lately, it's about router hacking(for this post. I'm not talking about your home ADSL router. I'm talking about bigger routers, such as Ciscos/Junipers
/Huaweis used by ISPs for their infrastructure). Hacking routers has been good business for us and our 5-eyes partners for some time now, but it is becoming more apparent
that other nation states 3re honing their skillz 3nd joining the scene. Before I get into it too much, let s go over some of the things that someone could do if they h3ck a router:

*	You could add credentials, allowing yourself to log in anytime you choose

*	You could add/change routing rules

*	You could setup a packet capture capability...imagine running Wiresh3rkon an ISP’s infrastructure router...like a local listening post for any credentials being passed over the
wire(!)

*	You could weaken any VPN encryption capabilities on the router, forcing it to create easily decryptable tunnels

*	You could install a dorked version of the Operating System with whatever functionality you want pre-built in
