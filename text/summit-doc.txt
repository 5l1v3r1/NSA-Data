Summits may provide an attractive target for terrorists seeking to capitalize on the media

coverage.

The Community judges, however, that issucwbascd extremists pose a more likely threat 
to the Summits. These extremists have conducted acts of vandalism at previous G8 and G20

summits. Similar disruptive activity will probably occur throughout the Summi
more concentrated during the G20 in Toronto.
