Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for<br>instructions.<br>(U) Course Overview:<br>(TS//SI) Economic espionage impacts the United States on many fronts. Not only has it cost the<br>United States upwards of $200 to $400 billion in intellectual property, but espionage is one of<br>the main methods used by foreign countries to modernize their defense industries. With the<br>United States at the cutting edge of technology development, it is the primary target of foreign<br>countries seeking to steal these technologies for their own gain. SIGINT can play a major role in<br>assessing the extent of the problem and preventing the loss of intellectual property through<br>providing indications of foreign targeting and collection against U.S. industries and governmental<br>organizations, activities of front companies being used for this collection, and plans of foreign<br>governments to use joint ventures with U.S. companies to acquire sensitive and/or proprietary<br>information.<br>(S) This session is classified TS//SI//NF and will not be videotaped.<br>(U) For further info: <br>POCs: Marilyn Maines, for SINIO Council<br>For information on this session, please contact <br>Counterintelligence, at<br>or<br>. <br><br>) <br><br>, Deputy SINIO for<br>, SINIO for Counterintelligence, at <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
