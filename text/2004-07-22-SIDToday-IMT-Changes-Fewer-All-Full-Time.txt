These changes are the result of a careful review of the first 18 months of the program<br>by a team of experts led by Jeanne Zimmer. The changes result in fewer IMTs, but with a fullfledged effort directed against each remaining focal area. Effective 12 July, the number of IMTs<br>was reduced by half, scaling down from fourteen IMTs to seven. In some cases, two of the old<br>IMTs were merged to form a single new IMT; in other cases IMTs were dissolved. In addition,<br>while some of the old IMTs worked on a part-time basis, all of the new IMTs will be full-time<br>positions.<br>(S//SI) Here's a rundown of the "before" and "after":<br>Pre-7/12 IMTs<br>Iraq<br>Counterterrorism<br>Combating Proliferation<br>Asia-Pacific<br>Korea<br>Latin America<br>Counternarcotics and Int'l Crime<br>MENA/Stans/India &amp; Pakistan<br>Africa<br>Europe<br>CounterintelligenceÂ·<br>Weapons &amp; SpaceÂ·<br>Global Geopolitical IssuesÂ·<br>Information Operations<br><br>Current IMTs<br><br>Iraq<br>Counterterrorism<br>Combatting Proliferation<br>Asia-Pacific (incl.

(Jeanne Zimmer is already at work, and<br>is scheduled to join her.)<br>Leaders are drawing up an IMT CONOP (Concept of Operations), incorporating input from<br>current and former IMT members.<br>Needed resources (budget, space, etc.) will be identified.<br>SID will name initial areas of concentration for each of the new IMTs.<br>(S//SI) The IMTs' job is to concentrate on strategic planning, assessing the end-to-end<br>performance of the SIGINT System against each topic. Since the IMT initiative has been so<br>successful in dealing with crises in Iraq and elsewhere, the teams are "here to stay." In the<br>words of Signals Intelligence Director MG Quirk, these changes represent "the next step in the<br>journey," as the directorate finds the best IMT structure to suit operational needs.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
