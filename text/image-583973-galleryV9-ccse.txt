4 (TS//SI//REL) Once the query finishes, look at the Equivalent IDs section. This will show
you other selectors that your target is using. This is determined by linking content
(loglns/email registrations/etc). It is worth verifying that these are indeed selectors
associated to your target. NSA QUANTUM works best against <yahoo> and
<facebook>. Although, it is worth making note of a <gmail> selector for possible GCHQ
QUANTUM support or for your own notes.
