Response to improving security

•	For the past decade, NSA has lead an
aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely
used Internet encryption technologies

•	Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming on line

•	Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which
have up till now been discarded are now
exploitable

•	Major new processing systems, SIGDEV efforts
and tasking must be put in place to capitalize on
this opportunity

Sensitivities

•	Cryptanalytic capabilities

-	Are extremely difficult and costly to acquire

-	Require a long lead time

-	Depend on sensitive sources

-	Are very fragile

-	If lost, may never be regained

•	The mere “fact of” a capability is very sensitive:

-	An adversary who knows we can/cannot break is
able to elude our capabilities even without knowing the
technical details of how the capabilities work
