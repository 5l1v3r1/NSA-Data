TOP SECRET STRAP1

Response to improving security

For the past decade, NSA has lead an
aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely
used Internet technologies

capabilities are now coming on line

- Vast amounts of Internet data which
have up till now been discarded are now
exploitable

- Major new processing systems, SIGDEV efforts
and tasking must be put in place to capitalize on
this opportunity

PTD ?We penetrate targets? defences.?

 



TOP SECRET STRAP1
Sensitivities
capabilities

Are extremely difficult and costly to acquire
Require a long lead time

Depend on sensitive sources

Are very fragile

If lost, may never be regained

The mere ?fact of? a capability is very sensitive:

An adversary who knows what we can/cannot break is
able to elude our capabilities even without knowing the
technical details of how the capabilities work

TOP SECRET STRAP1

Protecting BULLRUN Capabilities

- Technical and operational details

Need to be known only by and those who
enable 

Protected by established 
- PICARESQUE PAWLEYS, AMBULANT, 

?Fact of? information

Needs to be known very widely within the SIGINT
production chain

Protect with new secure community of interest (COI)

PTD ?We penetrate targets? defences.?

 



TOP SECRET STRAP1
Protecting the Info Secure COI

Secure Community of Interest (COI) protects
?fact of? as well as volume and scope of the
capability

- BULLRUN indoctrination required for access to

COI
- BULLRUN-related material, data 
content and details must

be protected within the COI

TOP SECRET STRAP1
Protecting the information

- BULLRUN is for internal (Sigint) use only

- Implemented at NSA DSD GCSB to
follow

- Not to be shared with UK Partners customers

- EP not to reveal sources methods; further
guidance to be developed

- BULLRUN brief on Gcwiki for reference

TOP SECRET STRAP1

Examples

(S 81) Unspecified capabilities against IPSEC,
SSH, PPTP, eChat, 

- (TS Sl COMINT) Capabilities against the used in
IPSEC, SSH, PPTP, eChat, 

- (TS 82 BULLRUN) Capability against specific applications

TOP SECRET STRAP1

BULLRUN Bottom Line

Groundbreaking capabilities

- Extremely fragile

- Do not ask about or speculate on sources or methods
underpinning BULLRUN successes

- Indoctrination required for access to secure COI
