"Isn't that in the middle of nowhere?"<br>(U) I nodded. We stared at each other across the table, trying to<br>imagine our lives at such a remote location. But <br> applied and<br>was accepted, and more than a year later, here we are in the<br>Outback.<br> <br>(U) Alice Springs is a town of 27,000 people that gets almost<br>400,000 tourists a year. Most visitors prefer to come in the fall and<br>winter; in summer, the heat regularly exceeds one hundred<br>degrees. The nearest cities of any size, Adelaide and Darwin, are<br>eight hundred miles away to the north and south. There's virtually<br>nothing east or west, except snakes, lizards and kangaroos. It's<br>one of the most remote cities of its size anywhere in the world, and<br>that sense of adventure was part of its appeal.<br>(U) Alice is the kind of place where you make your own fun, so<br>we've been to the Camel Cup, the annual camel races, and the<br>Henley-on-Todd, where people race in bottomless boats in the dry<br>Todd riverbed. <br>(U) Besides those two annual events, we've also taken rides on a<br>camel and in a hot-air balloon, and we've enjoyed didgeridoo<br>concerts, a night of star gazing, and trips to Uluru (Ayers Rock),<br>Sydney, Tasmania and New Zealand. We've watched kangaroos<br>hop across the land behind our house, and we've awakened to the<br>screeching of exotic pink and gray parrots. We've seen some<br>incredible sunrises, and for the first time in my life, I've been able<br>to see the milky part of the Milky Way. The stars are so bright in<br>Alice's clear air, you'd swear you could touch them.<br>(U) For an isolated city of its size, Alice has an energetic arts<br>community. I was surprised at how large and modern the local arts<br>center is, with two theaters and several galleries. It attracts<br>national performers, from award winning dance and music groups<br>to the annual Melbourne Comedy Festival Roadshow. Several<br>different arts and music festivals celebrating local talent take place<br>during the year. The Alice Springs Choral Society, which I've<br>joined, performs some of the most challenging music I've ever<br>sung.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '04 <br>1.  Letter From Ottawa<br>2.  Yakima: Fertile<br>Valley in the High<br>Desert<br>3.  Life in Alice<br>4.  Omaha - The Heart<br>of the Heartland<br>5.  Life in the Big Apple<br>6.  'Dropping Anchor' in<br>Anchorage<br><br> </p>(U) Many people associate Alice Springs and its constant sunshine<br>with year-long outdoor sports. Neither of us is the athletic type,<br>but if we wanted to try, there's plenty of opportunity. People play<br>on all kinds of teams, for all age groups - baseball, softball, rugby,<br>soccer, netball, volleyball, Aussie-rules football, tennis, swimming,<br>you name it. There are a couple of cycling clubs, and many folks<br>enjoy camping nearby.<br>(U) Since you don't have to spend time sitting in traffic, Alice is a<br>great place to try new things. I've been fossicking for garnets.<br>We've fed black-footed wallabies that live on a nearby rocky<br>hillside. I'm planning to cycle the eighteen miles to the facility<br>before winter's end this year. I can't draw, but didn't let that stop<br>me from taking up watercolors.<br>(U) Our first year of our two-year tour seemed to fly by, and it was<br>time to decide if we wanted to extend. We didn't have to discuss<br>that very long. For a place in the middle of nowhere, we've found<br>the quality of our lives here to be high. With the lack of traffic, the<br>sunny weather, and the variety of experiences we've enjoyed,<br>we're happy to stay two more years in this town called Alice.<br>(U//FOUO) See the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap webpage .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
