It can be used to establish standalone networks, or to connect to a traditional public phone system via a standard PSTN* line.<br>HPCPs operate in FM mode in the VHF/UHF frequency ranges from 30Mhz - 930Mhz; transmit<br>voice, data, and fax traffic; and have impressive line-of-site ranges of from 5 to 150 kilometers.<br>In light of this, it is easy to understand why HPCP usage is rapidly increasing throughout the<br>world.<br>(C) Use of HPCP technology by the global community was initially found in the environment by<br>RAINFALL in 1998. In May 2001, a large number of HPCP phones were sold in Iraq, which was<br>validated through collection and survey efforts, thereby making it high-value exploitation for<br>NSA.<br>(S//SI) SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Strategy &amp; Governance (SSG) created the HAC in May<br>2003 to further the understanding of worldwide HPCP technology to enhance ongoing HPCP<br>SIGDEV efforts across the extended enterprise. The HAC's unique roles as a Center of Excellence<br>include, but are not limited to:<br>HPCP trend analysis,<br>consolidation and sharing of corporate HPCP knowledge,<br>coordination of HPCP SIGDEV,<br>analytical tool development and training, and the<br>development of general knowledge about HPCP communications.<br>HAC analysts also provide geolocational, network, and dialing analysis of HPCP metadata in<br>support of target development on a worldwide basis.<br>(S//SI) A HAC analyst conducting HPCP trend analysis saw the deteriorating political situation on<br>the ground in Haiti and initiated a baseline study of HPCP activity in there in early February<br>2004. He started by conducting a seven-day data pull of all HPCP Base Stations geolocated in<br>Haiti from the SIGINT Emitter Database (SEDB). Out of this pool of emitters, he conducted call<br>chaining on those with the heaviest call volume. He identified Base Station B3A8 operating in<br>Jacmel, Haiti, a suspected drug lord-controlled town, in contact with Haitian interim President<br>Boniface Alexander and the Interior Ministry's Zero Tolerance team. This data was immediately<br>passed to the Latin America and Caribbean Division (S2A3), which submitted a request for<br>overhead collection of the HPCP base station in Jacmel and the phone numbers tied to the<br>government ministries. S2A3 also asked for further assistance from the HAC for continued<br>SIGDEV support of the target.<br>(S//SI) HAC analysts have been to SOUTHCOM HQs to brief the J2* as to the necessity of HPCP<br>exploitation in the Latin American Area of Responsibility (AOR), specifically Colombia. Current<br>HAC projects also include tracking HPCP activity within the Sunni Triangle (specifically Baqubah,<br>Habbaniyah, Ar Ramadi, and Al Fallujah) and providing CENTCOM an HPCP baseline for all HPCP<br>activity that may be IED*-related along Highway 10 between Ar Ramadi and Baghdad in support<br>of the Global War On Terror.<br>(S//SI) There are currently more than 340 different models of HPCP in use throughout the<br>world. Collecting, identifying, and exploiting them is, and will continue to be, a real challenge to<br>the NSA. For more information about ongoing analytical efforts in the HAC visit the HAC<br>homepage .
