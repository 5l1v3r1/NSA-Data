(S//SI) A shining example of focused mission support to the Games was that being
provided by the Link Access Support to the Olympics (LASO) team. Comprised of
subject matter experts from the Office of Overhead (OH), Radio Frequency
Operations (RFO), Special Collection Service (SCS) and Special Source Operations
(SSO), the LASO team was the focal point for everything Olympics -- from planning
to resource allocation through collection management and crisis response -- for all
Olympics security operations. LA team members supported the SID Olympics team
for more than 10 months, and were in place well before the opening ceremonies.

(S//SI) NSA/CSS Olympic operations included several major initiatives within LA
spanning its accesses: BLUE FORCE TRACKING, SCS and SSO. SCS support
included the activities of US-966G and two survey sites (US-969X183 and
US-969X202). SSO support included deployment of access capabilities (APRIL
FLOWERS) to directly support the Olympics. LA Olympic Operations and the LASO
Team concept were just a small part of the larger corporate effort to the XXVIII
Summer Olympiad made possible with the hard work and dedication of many NSA
organizations working together to achieve a common goal -- a safe Olympics!
