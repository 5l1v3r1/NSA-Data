Collaborative cloud research effort between 5 different
organizations crossing 3 NSA Directorates:

-	Signals Intelligence: S2I, S22, SSG

-	Research: R6

-	Technology: T12, T14

Partnerships

-	TMAC/FASTSCOPE

-	MIT Lincoln Labs & Harvard

SKYNET applies complex combinations of geospatial,
geotemporal, pattern-of-life, and travel analytics to
bulk DNR data to identify patterns of suspect activity

SKYNET Analytic Questions

Who has traveled from Peshawar to Faisalabad or
Lahore (and back) in the past month?

•	Who does the traveler call when he arrives?

•	Who else is seen in the area when the traveler arrives, and
who seen leaving the area shortly afterward?

Who travels to/from Peshawar every other Sunday and
"somewhere else" on a weekly basis?

Who visits Akora Khattak periodically and also travels
between Peshawar and Lahore?

Who fits the above travel profiles and also possesses
unusual behavior:

•	One or two hops from other suspects or known tasked
selectors

•	Frequent handset swapping or powering down

DEMONSPIT is a new dataflow for bulk Call Data Records (CDRs) from
Pakistan

-	CDRs are being acquired from major PK Telecom providers

Data is normalized through TUSKATTIRE, like all other Call Data Records
DEMONSPIT data is forwarded by TUSKATTIRE to several Clouds:

-	GMHalo/DPS

•	Promotes records to FASCIA and feeds the SEDB Tower QFD

-	GMPIace & Cloud 14

•	Ingests DEMONSPIT into Sortinglead summaries to support SKYNET
Analytics

•	Ingests DEMONSPIT into a Perishable QFD which will be available to
analysts via JEMA and CINEPLEX

-	Bulldozer/MDR2
