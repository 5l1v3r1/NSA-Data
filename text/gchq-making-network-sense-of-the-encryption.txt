GCHQ metadata

•	GCHQ now creating metadata on:

-	SSL/TLS

-	IKE

-	OpenVPN

-	SSH

-	SQUEAL signatures (Various crypt packages)

•	Data available in BEARDED PIGGY and/or the

How can Network Analysis help ?

• Can NAC help
make sense using
network

knowledge of the
volumes of data to
isolate that which
we want to
decrypt...

The Seed Approach

•	Turn Seed IP into network block

•	Query on network block against metadata

•	Chain outwards / fuzzy subnet logic

•	Basis of NTAT developed tradecraft:

-	IRASCIBLE HARE

-	IRASCIBLE RABBIT

-	IRASCIBLE MOOSE

-	IRASCIBLE EMITT

Known usage

•	Target known to use encryption

-	Identify target subnet

-	Select on subnet against metadata

•	Or...

-	Start with an AS - look for most interesting wheel

-	BELGACOM - AS6774 - known to run GRX links to MNO

over VPN

Network Knowledge enrichment

•	Internet Registry information

•	IP Geolocation

•	DNS

•	Data derived from network device configuration files

(routers/Firewalls etc)

•	Network information on surrounding IPs (i.e. rest of subnet is

MNO related)

Access Optimisation

•	A given role of Network Analysis is optimising access for a given
problem - in this case enabling two-ended collection

•	Or....Identifying opportunities to get at the data before it is

encrypted therefore no need to make sense of encrypted data.

Can do this both:

-	Passive

-	Active
