• xks_app_launcher is running, but not
starting processes specified in the
Computer Resources window?

• This may indicate that the xks_app_launcher is
defunct. Use the kill command to kill the
app launcher and its related sub-processes:

►	Typepkill -f app_

■ If a PID is not being specified, use the pkill command. The -f
option kills all of the sub-processes.

►	Type ps to look for the new xks app launcher process.
