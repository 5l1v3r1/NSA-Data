We<br>encourage experienced, hard-working intelligence officers to apply.<br>(U//FOUO) Some background on TTIC: TTIC stood up on 1 May 2003, as directed by President<br>Bush in his State of the Union Address. The scope and complexity of international terrorism<br>requires the Intelligence, Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, Defense, and Diplomatic<br>Communities to join forces and combine knowledge. As a result, TTIC is composed of partner<br>organizations including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security,<br>Department of Defense, Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency and others. While<br>today TTIC does not "belong" to any department or agency and reports directly to the DCI, the<br>August 2004 Executive Order establishing a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) calls for<br>the NCTC to undertake all functions assigned to TTIC. TTIC now has over 500 employees<br>(including USG staff and contractors). The organization will grow even more once it transitions to<br>NCTC. Since June 2004, TTIC has been residing in a well-appointed new facility near Tysons<br>Corner, Virginia, along with parts of the DCI's Counter-Terrorism Center (CTC) and the FBI's<br>Counter-Terrorism Division.<br>(U//FOUO) If you want to know what life is like in TTIC, please feel free to contact any of the<br>following NSAers who are already at TTIC: <br> ,<br> , <br> or <br> .
