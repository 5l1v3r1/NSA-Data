Its purpose is to provide a mechanism to<br>enhance the orgnization's ability to get the right people in the right places, to help us take<br>maximum advantage of developmental opportunities for our people, and to help advance the<br>career aspirations of our people. The CDB will consider all GG-15's and those GG-14's who are in<br>GG-15 level positions. It will make recommendations to me; I will make the decisions.<br>(U//FOUO) I would like to include all GG-14's in the future, but the size of our population makes<br>that untenable now. The CDB is not our only mechanism for working personnel issues. Indeed,<br>especially initially, it will likely provide a relatively small but important adjunct to existing<br>processes such as vacancy announcements. My hope is that we will be able to get the CDB in<br>good enough form to be able to assist in assimilating field returnees later this year.<br>(U//FOUO) Also coming soon is the next round of the promotion process. It is almost certain to<br>be the last conducted under the current process, which will be superseded by changes in our HR<br>programs later this year and next. I urge each of you to update your Internal Staffing Resume<br>and to prepare a Promotion Review Package. That package will be due to your first line<br>supervisor on 8 March. The June 04 A&amp;P Promotion Process and Promotion Timeline are available<br>off the A&amp;P web page at the following url: <br>(U//FOUO) Also available at that web site are guidelines for the Language Analysis and<br>Intelligence Analysis Skill Communities. These guidelines do not represent separate promotion<br>criteria, but simply provide examples of accomplishments against the standard Agency criteria<br>for promotion in the LA and IA skill communities. For your convenience, you can link to both the<br>SID Promotion web page and the HRS promotion web page from the A&amp;P web site. If you have<br>questions related to the FY04 promotion process, please contact the team of<br>, <br>, and Jil Aspatore <br>.)<br>(U//FOUO) As you know, the Director has addressed the new Compensation Reform in an email<br>and in a recent session on Talk NSA. I want to let you know that both SID and A&amp;P are fully<br>engaged in this process and that we will be working very closely with HR thoughout this next<br>year in transitioning to the new personnel system at the Agency. We will provide additional<br>information to you as it becomes available. For an overview of the new personnel system, please<br>type "go comp reform." For specific questions, send an e-mail to "ASK _COMPREFORM."<br>(U//FOUO) Changes in personnel-related processes naturally create a great deal of anxiety, but I<br>am confident that these changes will benefit the A&amp;P civilians affected by them.<br>V/R - Jim<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
