Multisearch IP Address:

The Multisearch IP Address query allows you to search on an IP address into seven
different searches. Think of it as a federated query using an IP address. The Multisearch
IP Address query searches on:

•	User Activity

•	Phone Number Extractor

•	Email Addresses

•	Extracted Files

•	HTTP Activity

•	Full Log

•	Web Proxy

Refer to some of the individual searches below for more information about specific
queries

Creating a MuItiSearch IP Address Query:

When you have Filled in your query name, justified it, entered an IP address, selected
your search engines and sites the last thing is to submit the query. If you select “Merge
Results”, then all of your individual queries will be merged into one consolidated result.

“Why would I w ant to merge my results?”

If you wanted to see all of the activity together to get a ‘big picture’ look at the IP
address, regardless of the activity or application that is on the IP. The New GUI's results
screens allow you to filter your results easily which may make viewing your results more
intuitive. Sec "Viewing Your Results" in this Guide.

“What would I w ant to NOT merge my results?"

Viewing the results individually allows you to focus on a particular activity or result (e.g.
Documents or email addresses).
