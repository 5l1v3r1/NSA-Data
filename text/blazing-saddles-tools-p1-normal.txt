[edit! Overview

BLAZING SADDLES is the TDB
portion of the second pilot of the Next
Generation Events project under the Better
Analysis Programme. The primary
objective of BLAZING SADDLES is to
increase the supportability and scale of
presence events stored for a number of
key internet profiling tools. This will be
achieved by the deployment of a range of
Applied Research OFDs and an instance
of Black Hole to a TDB maintained
experiment environment at Cheltenham
and also at Bude. For more background to
this work sec the (J: internet Profiling SE
