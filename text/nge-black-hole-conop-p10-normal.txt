Getting Access to the BLACK HOLE Data

42.	As well as being a source of data for the various QFDs, the NGE BLACK HOLE
will be a source of data for TR, Ops and SD people wanting to perform
investigatory and data-mining tasks on the data.

43.	The task is complicated by the fact that there will be 2 instance of the BLACK
HOLE - one at Cheltenham and one at Bude.

44.	The option for getting access to the data and running analytics against it is:

• Extract the data from the BH storage onto the storage attached to the
analytics platform.

45. Figure 2 shows the methods of getting access to the BLACK HOLE Data.
