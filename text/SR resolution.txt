28/... The right to privacy in the digital age

The Human Rights Council,

Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, including the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

Recalling the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all
human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,

Recalling Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 on institution-building of the
Council, and resolution 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate
Holders of the Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall
discharge his or her duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,

Recalling also General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and
69/166 of 18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, and Human Rights
Council decision 25/117 on the panel on the right to privacy in the digital age,

Recalling further Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 2012 and 26/13
of 26 June 2014 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the
Internet,

Welcoming the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights on the right to privacy in the digital age, noting with interest its report
thereon,1 and recalling the panel discussion on the right to privacy in the digital age held
during the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council,2

Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection
of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism,3 and the report of
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion
and expression,4

Noting with appreciation general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee
on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of
honour and reputation,5 while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place
since its adoption,

A/HRC/28/L.27

Recalling that the General Assembly in its resolution 69/166 encourages the Human
Rights Council to remain actively seized of the debate on the right to privacy in the digital
age, with the purpose of identifying and clarifying principles, standards and best practices
regarding the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, and to consider the
possibility of establishing a special procedure to that end,

Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international
human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in
the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies, the
impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to
examine the principles of non-arbitrariness and lawfulness, and the relevance of necessity
and proportionality assessments in relation to surveillance practices,

Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be
subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or
correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and
recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of the
right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to
freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a
democratic society,

Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over
the world to use new information and communications technology and at the same time
enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake
surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in
particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is
therefore an issue of increasing concern,

Noting also that, while metadata can provide benefits, certain types of metadata,
when aggregated, can reveal personal information and can give an insight into an
individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity,

Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations
regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals
and/or collect personal data and when they require disclosure of personal data from third
parties, including private companies,

Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights as
set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United
Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework,

Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of
communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of
communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out
on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights,

Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations
engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently
face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary
interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities,

Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and
protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their
obligations under international human rights law,

Noting also in that respect that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a
public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any
