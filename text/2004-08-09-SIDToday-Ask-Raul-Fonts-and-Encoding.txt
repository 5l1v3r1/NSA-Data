DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Ask Raul: Fonts and Encoding<br>FROM: 'Raul', a DNI Analyst<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 08/09/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the first of a<br>monthly series of articles on DNI (Digital Network Intelligence)<br>matters by guest columnist Raul:<br>(U) Hey, Raul! What's the difference between a font and a<br>character set encoding? Aren't they the same?<br>(U) Argh!!! If there is one thing that will drive old Raul crazy it is<br>hearing people -- people who have been through endless NSA<br>C2C/DNI courses -- referring to an encoding as a font or vice<br>versa. So, in order to help keep my blood pressure down, here's<br>how it works:<br>(U) A font is simply a collection of symbols (glyphs) of a particular<br>style and size. Fonts have names which may or may not be of any<br>use in figuring out what they cover. For example: Times, Times<br>New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman Cyrillic, Ivan's<br>Crazy Cyrillic, etc. For a given language or glyph set, the different<br>fonts are simply different styles of the same thing.<br>For example, here are the letters 'ABCDEF' in several different<br>fonts:<br> <br>(U) In this case there isn't much difference to the eye between<br>Helvetica and Times but AvantGarde and Courier are obviously<br>different from one another and the last two.<br>(U) Computers use fonts as the means to allow them to display<br>things, whether that be on a monitor or printer, to a human being.<br>At the core though, the computer simply sees things as numbers.<br>To give you an idea, here is an entire font, Lucida Sans Typewriter:<br> <br>(U) In this case, the font name, which is listed at the top of this<br>image, tells us the encoding this font uses is ISO8859-1. This<br>standard says that certain glyphs will be encoded with specific<br>values. Here, 'A', regardless of how fancy it might be, will always<br>be represented by the number 0x41 (decimal 65), 'B' will be 0x42<br>(66), 'a' will be 0x61 (97), etc.<br>(U) An encoding is simply a method of representing one thing with<br>something else. In this case it is glyphs with numbers. In a file, on<br>a computer using ISO8859-1 encoding, the phrase, <br>"The big black bird"<br>is actually stored as: <br>0x540x680x650x200x620x690x670x200x620x6c0x610x630x6b0x<br>200x620x690x720x640x2e<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Ask Raul - Answers<br>to DNI Questions<br>1.

Ask Raul : Getting<br>the Most from<br>Metadata<br><br> </p>It is only when we send this to a display device that it gets<br>transformed, via a font, into:<br>The big black bird<br>(U) Every foreign language is covered by a multitude of encodings.<br>Some are international standards while others are completely<br>home grown.<br>(U) In some cases, an encoding will use a single 7 or 8-bit value to<br>represent a single glyph. In others, 16, 24, or even 32 bits can be<br>used. For example, here are a few of the encodings that cover the<br>Cyrillic letter 'A':<br>Glyph<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br>A<br><br>Encoding<br><br>Value<br><br>ISO8859-5<br>KOI-8<br>CP1251<br>JAVA<br>UCS-2LE<br>UCS-2BE<br>UTF-8<br><br>0xb0<br>0xf1<br>0xd0<br>\u0410<br>0x100x04<br>0x040x10<br>0xd00x90<br><br>(U) As you can readily see, if you go looking for something and<br>don't allow for the encoding, you are not likely to find what you<br>want.<br>(U) So, do Raul a favor and keep your fonts and encodings straight.<br>(U) If you have a DNI-related question for Raul, please use the<br>"comments/suggestions" function at the bottom of this page to<br>pose it.
