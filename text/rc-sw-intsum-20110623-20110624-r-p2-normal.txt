SUBJ: NAD'ALI TALIBAN SECURITY SITUATION IN SHIN KALAY

AS OF 22 JUN 11, DCC CHAIRMAN HAJI BARAKZAI (KHAROTI) (P64495) AND TALIBAN (TB) COMMANDER HAJI MAHMAT
KHAN (NYPI) INTEND TO CREATE AN AFFILIATION BETWEEN THE ALP AND THE TB IN SHIN KALAY (41R PR 158 016).

APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH AGO BARAKZAI SENT THREE KHAROTI TRIBAL ELDERS TO QUETTA (42R UU 08 42) TO
REPRESENT HIM IN A MEETING WITH HAJI MAHMAT KHAN. DURING THE MEETING A PLAN WAS DISCUSSED TO
CREATE AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE ALP AND THE TB. BARAKZAI AND KHAN PLAN A CEASEFIRE BETWEEN THE
TB AND ALP OFFICERS IN SHIN KALAY. THE INTENTION IS TO CREATE A PERCEPTION OF A SECURE DISTRICT,
DEMONSTRATING TO ISAF THAT THE ALP CAN PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR LOCAL NATIONALS (LNS). WHEN THE ALP
HAVE GAINED CONTROL OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN SHIN KALAY, MAHMAT KHAN AND HIS SUBORDINATES INTEND
TO RETURN TO THE AREA WHERE THEY FEEL THEY WILL BE SAFE FROM ISAF. (C/S ^^|) (OBJ INDIA), C/S

AND OTHER TB FIGHTERS HAVE BEGUN MOVING BACK TO SHIN KALAY AS A RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

BARAKZAI'S LONG TERM AIM IS TO GAIN INFLUENCE AND WEALTH FROM GIROA. TO ACHIEVE THIS BARAKZAI NEEDS
TO APPEASE BOTH THE TB AND LNS. LNS IN SHIN KALAY NO LONGER FEEL SAFE UNDER ISAF SECURITY SINCE THE
DEATH OF TWO LNS SHOT BY ISAF APPROXIMATELY 15 DAYS AGO. BARAKZAI HAS ENCOURAGED LNS TO SEPARATE
THEMSELVES FROM ISAF AND IN RETURN HE WILL ENSURE THE ALP PROVIDES A SECURE DISTRICT. BARAKZAI PLANS
TO ALLOW TB USE OF SHIN KALAY AS A SAFE HAVEN TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN NAD 'ALI (NDA) (41R PR 177 014). TB
WILL BE PERMITTED TO USE COMPOUNDS AS BDLS AND WEAPON CACHES DUE TO THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
AFFORDED BY BARAKZAI'S ARRANGEMENTS.

THE SHIN KALAY ALP IS CURRENTLY IN THE FINAL STAGES OF TRAINING AND IS AWAITING WEAPONS AND
EQUIPMENT TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS. BARAKZAI AND NEWLY APPOINTED ALP REPRESENTATIVE GHULAM JILANI
ARE INVOLVED IN THE RECEIPT OF THE WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT FROM GIROA. JILANI IS ALSO AWARE OF THE
ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN BARAKZAI AND KHAN AND FULLY SUPPORTS IT.

TALIBAN CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES

IN MUSA QAL'AH, TALIBAN MEMBERS REPORTEDLY ATTACKED AND KILLED TWO OF THEIR OWN TO COVER UP
THE FACT THEY WERE CONDUCTING AN UNSANCTIONED TALIBAN CHECKPOINT TO ROB PASSERS BYE DUE TO
THEIR LACK OF FUNDS. SUPPLY ISSUES AND FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ARE CAUSING DISCORD BETWEEN SOME
INSURGENTS AND THEIR COMMANDERS. TO THE SOUTH IN NAHR E SARAJ, AN INSURGENT KILLED A LOCAL
NATIONAL DURING A FIST FIGHT OVER THE LOCAL POPULACES' REFUSAL TO PROVIDE FOOD TO THE TALIBAN.
THE LOCAL NATIONALS RETALIATED BY KILLING ONE INSURGENT AND WOUNDING ANOTHER. THIS INCIDENT IS
FURTHER EXAMPLE OF THE LOSS OF LOCAL NATIONAL SUPPORT, WHICH HA^EDUCEtCTHE TALIBAN'S FREEDOM
OF MOVEMENT (FoM). IN SOUTHERN GARM SER, THE ASSOCIATES OF	(OBJ HASTINGS) AND

ANOTHER TALIBAN COMMANDER ARE REPORTEDLY UNABLE TO CARRY OUT OPERATIONS EFFECTIVELY.
PREVIOUS REPORTING INDICATES INSURGENTS IN SOUTHERN GARM SER SUFFER FROM A LACK OF COMPETENT
COMMANDERS AND LOGISTICAL ISSUES. THESE ISSUES ARE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECREASED KINETIC
ACTIVITY IN THE REGION THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST.
