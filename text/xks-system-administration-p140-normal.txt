select status,

count(*),datetime_submitted,(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(now()) -
UNIX TIMESTAMP(datetime_submitted))/3600 from
sdb query jobs where (datetime submitted>(now() - INTERVAL
'1' DAY)) group by status;

■ To display the number of queries processed per
hour for the current day:

• Type

select status,count(*)/24 AS queries_per_hour from
sdb_query_jobs where cancel!="C" and

(datetime_submitted>(now() - INTERVAL ’1' DAY)) AS Backlog

days, to complete based on the backlog and the
processing trends.
