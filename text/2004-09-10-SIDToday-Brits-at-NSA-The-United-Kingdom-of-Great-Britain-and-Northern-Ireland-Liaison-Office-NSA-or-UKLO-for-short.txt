Orange<br>picture passes and cars with peculiar number plates are therefore a common sight at Fort Meade<br>- but what do all these Brits do, and how long have we been here?<br><br>(C) With the ?rst UK Siginter posted to the US in 1941, the UK-US integree programme actually<br>pre-dates UKUSA (the 1946 agreement that cemented the relationship between the Sigint<br>services of the US, UK and Canada; Australia and New Zealand joining the 2nd Party club soon<br>afterwards). At the heart of the early relationship was collaboration on this is still<br>the case today, but UK integrees have for a long time also been embedded in Analysis and<br>Production - where, for example, we are establishing two news posts in the Of?ce of Counter-<br>Terrorism; Data Acquisition; and in a wide range of technical roles.<br><br>(C) The UK Liaison Team (UKLT) goes back almost as far, its history stretching from a Col <br>O'Connor, posted to Washington DC in 1943 to represent the British Governm <br>Cipher School, to the present day GCHQ Senior UK Liaison Of?cer (SUKLO), who<br>splits her time between DC and Fort Meade. Besides -, there are currently 10 other liaison<br>of?cers covering the full range of business:<br><br>RD, HR, security, ?nance, legal and public affairs)<br>- An I Pr duction<br>- Technology, including <br><br> <br>    <br>  <br><br>- Data Acquisition<br>- In ormatlon Assurance<br>Business Support<br><br>   <br> <br><br>UK Liaison Team<br>We also have a support team, and an of?ce at the British Embassy in DC.<br><br>(C) These days the UKLT is busier than ever. This year alone we expect to have nearly 2000 UK<br>visitors to NSA, mostly from GCHQ but also from other UK organisations such as the Secret<br>Intelligence Service, the Security Service (M15), the Ministry of Defense and the UK Joint<br>Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC - the equivalent of US We work closely with the Foreign<br>Affairs Directorate to make sure that visit programmes match visitors with the most appropriate<br>areas of NSA, and that arrangements work smoothly from ?rst arrival at the Visitor Center<br>onwards.<br><br>(C) But it's not just about visits. The UKLT also helps maintain existing relationships, and aims<br>to identify new areas where there are opportunities for GCHQ and NSA to work together for<br>mutual benefit. These opportunities can be identified from within either organisation - but just<br>as often it is the liaison officers who can spot things that need to be done, through being able to<br>take both a UK and US perspective. And, with GCHQ's backing, the UKLOs aim to make an active<br>contribution themselves, especially where our diverse Sigint backgrounds are directly relevant to<br>the issue at hand. This has been particularly true over the last two years, as we have worked<br>together to support coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br><br>(U) Besides work, we are also a source of advice on cultural and historical issues. We deliver<br>regular brie?ngs on how real footballs are round; why it's possible for beer to be too cold; and<br>why petrol (sorry, gas) at $2 a gallon is really very, very cheap. We are also on hand to explain<br><br></p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">that 4 July isn't really all that historically significant, and that we're glad the Royal Navy left<br>enough of Fort McHenry standing to make a great day out for the kids. But seriously - the<br>UKUSA relationship is important to US national security, and absolutely critical to the UK. We<br>are grateful to all those at NSA who devote so much time and effort to working with us as<br>partners, and who help ensure GCHQ-NSA collaboration remains an important success story.<br>(C) Feel free to visit us any time in 2B7042 (or ring <br>) if you would like our help on any<br>issue, or simply to find out more about UK Sigint.
