Although I<br>had been working as a reporter and analyst in SID's Pakistan<br>Branch for approximately 8 months prior to my TDY, I was excited<br>to learn about the technical aspects of SIGINT collection and to<br>provide support to the variety of SIGINT customers forward<br>deployed throughout the region.<br><br>(U) The author pictured with al-Qa'ida graffiti in Murre, Pakistan.<br>The building is a long-abandoned brewery built under British rule.<br>(S//SI) Because this was my first time living and working in a<br>different country, I was not really sure what to expect once I finally<br>landed in Islamabad. However, as I met the rest of the team that I<br>would be working with for the next 74 days, I could see that they<br>were very knowledgeable and dedicated to their jobs and they<br>quickly made me feel right at home.<br>(TS//SI) Because I was already familiar with the target, I was able<br>to jump into SIGINT product reporting via Local Support Reports<br>(LSRs) but was also encouraged to branch out into other SIGINT<br>areas besides reporting. I spent time with the collectors learning<br>about the various signal types that were collected at the site, about<br>the signals processing gear, and about various collection systems - I was even able to physically tune in a signal or two using the<br>spectrum analyzer and dish controller in the site's collection center.<br>(S//SI) As my technical knowledge increased, I became involved in<br>evaluating the content of new signals that were being targeted and<br>collected, examining the various types of traffic being carried on<br>the signal and then determining where the traffic came from. In<br>addition to becoming involved in various DNR* collection projects, I<br>was also able to branch out into the DNI* world, learning about<br>DNI collection and processing and basic DNI traffic analysis.<br>(S//SI) Because of the diversity of the target, working in Pakistan<br>provided me with the opportunity to become involved in a wide<br>range of projects: because I was forward deployed, I was able to<br>help provide near-real time support to counterterrorism operations<br>and was able to help in the exploitation of DNR and DNI lead<br>information gathered through SIGINT and HUMINT.<br>(TS//SI) These efforts paid their greatest dividends when one of<br>the site's terrorist targets who was being tracked via SIGINT was<br><br>1.

It was quite exciting to know that I<br>helped play a role in the target's capture and it was also very<br>enlightening to be a first-hand witness to "SIGINT in action" and to<br>see how the close collaboration between SCS, NSA, and CIA<br>personnel can produce real results.<br>(TS//SI) In addition to tracking specific terrorist targets, I was also<br>involved in helping to exploit and analyze lead information related<br>to several threats on the U.S. Embassy itself. Although Pakistan is<br>not as openly dangerous an area as other places, a real threat does<br>exist there as evidenced by the recent 28 October bombing at the<br>Marriott Hotel in Islamabad<br>(S//SI) While security was a constant concern, I was pleasantly<br>surprised at the level of freedom that Embassy personnel had and<br>was equally surprised at the fine shopping and restaurants to be<br>found throughout Islamabad -- cheap prices, high quality<br>handicrafts, and numerous large marketplaces made for a suitcase<br>that was much, much fuller on my return trip than it was when I<br>departed the States.<br>(S//SI) Overall, my TDY experience was one of most enriching<br>experiences of my entire life from both a personal and professional<br>perspective. I was able to gain broad professional knowledge and<br>experience that made me a better and more well-rounded analyst<br>and living and working in Pakistan for an extended period of time<br>provided me with a unique personal experience that gave me<br>insight into an entirely different culture that I would otherwise<br>never have been exposed to.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>SCS = Special Collection Service.
