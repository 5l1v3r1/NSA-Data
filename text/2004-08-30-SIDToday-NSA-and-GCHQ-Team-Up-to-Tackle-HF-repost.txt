DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(C) NSA and GCHQ Team Up to Tackle HF (repost)<br>FROM: <br>Deputy Chief, RFO/Corporate HF Services (S3311)<br>Run Date: 08/30/2004<br><br>(S//SI) Exploitation of HF (High Frequency) signals is one of the oldest forms of SIGINT. HF<br>technology continues to evolve with new protocols, features, and capabilities that make it an<br>attractive and inexpensive option for some of NSA's highest priority targets. The current HF<br>mission is based around legacy systems deployed in the 1980s and 1990s that are unable to<br>collect advanced HF technologies and long overdue for replacement. NSA is now in the midst of<br>revitalizing the ability to provide a responsive, agile sustained collection capability against HF.<br>(C) In late 2001 and 2002, NSA looked to our partners and industry to assess what they were<br>doing in this area and to take advantage of the current state of the art. It quickly became clear<br>that GCHQ* had solid business practices and a technology roadmap based around their emerging<br>GLAIVE HF/VHF/UHF collection architecture that would meet most of our needs. Discussions with<br>GCHQ led to the establishment of the Joint Strategic Off-Air (JSOA) Programme .<br>(C) Within this Joint Programme, GCHQ and NSA will jointly manage the mission, technology<br>development and deployment of HF/VHF/UHF collection capabilities to meet the intelligence<br>requirements of both nations. The Joint Programme Executive Board, located at GCHQ, is made<br>up of three GCHQ leaders and three NSA counterparts. Corporate HF Services at NSA is an<br>integral part of the JP, primarily providing project management and development services as the<br>JP meets US intelligence needs.<br>(S//SI) The Joint Programme is achieving immediate results while working towards the long<br>term goals of replacing all of the legacy systems by 2009. In early 2003, a GLAIVE system was<br>deployed to Kuwait to monitor Iraqi communications prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).<br>Then in December 2003, the Joint Programme deployed a GLAIVE system to Balad, Iraq to<br>collect local insurgents as well as provide a significant, strategically located SIGINT capability in<br>the Middle East. This system was also utilized for COMSEC monitoring - see the previous SID<br>today article . As of this week, operators in the Meade Operations Center are able to tune<br>receivers at RAF Digby in the UK. In early August, workstations will be installed at GRSOC to<br>give operators' access to existing UK and US front-ends worldwide.<br>(U//FOUO) The Joint Programme is breaking new ground for the UKUSA agreement -- the two<br>countries jointly manage the systems that are deployed in response to US and UK requirements,<br>and each will have access to the others' front-end resources. Look for a future SID today article<br>for an overview of GLAIVE and its current and future capabilities.<br>(U) This article first appeared on July 14, 2004.<br>* (U) Notes: <br>GCHQ = Government Communications Headquarters, the UK's SIGINT organization. <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p>DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
