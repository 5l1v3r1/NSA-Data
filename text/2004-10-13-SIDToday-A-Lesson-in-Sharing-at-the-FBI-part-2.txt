I also mentioned that education and<br>infrastructure can often pose significant challenges to this effort. I would now like to elaborate<br>on each of these and also describe the great strides that are being made to face these<br>challenges.<br>Education<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to attempting to make sure that NSA products are routed to the FBI<br>squads that should see them, and submitting requests for information back to NSA on their<br>behalf, a large portion of my time at WFO was spent explaining who NSA is, what we do, and<br>how we can help them. Almost every one of the analysts and agents I encountered at WFO was<br>cleared for TS//SCI, but a relatively small percentage of them took advantage of the wealth of<br>information that was readily available to them at that level. Many of them were simply not used<br>to working with SIGINT and had not learned the value of it. Others relied on the NSA<br>representative to give them any products that might be relevant to their investigations, which<br>was often difficult due to the large number of investigations being conducted at any one time.<br>(U//FOUO) I tried to take advantage of every opportunity I had to encourage WFO personnel to<br>get Intelink accounts so they could do their own research and pull product reports for<br>themselves. Inevitably, as soon as they found something relevant to their case they would begin<br>to realize the value of SIGINT and continue to come back for more. It's not easy for a "culture"<br>to start thinking differently than it has for so long, but education is the key to bringing<br>institutional change and it is beginning to happen at the FBI. Former SID director Maureen<br>Baginski has initiated several programs to help facilitate this transition, including mandated<br>SIGINT training for new agents as well as senior managers.<br>Infrastructure<br>(C) Infrastructure issues such as facilities and computer systems have also traditionally been a<br>key challenge to information sharing. Many of FBI's field offices have little or no SCIF space and<br>the computer systems and electronic databases that they access from their workstations on a<br>daily basis can only contain information up to the SECRET level. Obviously this makes it very<br>difficult for them to exchange any information with NSA.<br>(C) NSA's Customer Response is currently working on a series of tearline seminars, and FBI<br>personnel will have easier access to tearline reporting through Intelink-S. This is the most<br>customer-oriented approach and allows the FBI to gain the greatest benefit from NSA's<br>products. The facilities are improving also, as more SCIF space is being built and the FBI deploys<br>its Sensitive Compartmented Information Operational Network (SCION) systems to the field<br>offices. SCION allows access to TS/SI/TK/G/HCS material and users can request Intelink and<br>ICemail accounts. This system will greatly enhance FBI's access to NSA information once it is<br>fully operational in all of FBI's field offices.<br>(C) In fact, I was fortunate to be involved in a "virtual representative" initiative at FBI's Los<br>Angeles Field Office. Personnel in LA's counterterrorism division, acting as an intelligence hub for<br>the FBI's west coast offices, will use InfoWorkSpace (IWS) to network with NSA subject matter<br>experts as well as representatives at FBI HQ, Washington Field Office, and the Joint Terrorism<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">Task Force (JTTF) in New York. Once the necessary infrastructure upgrades are in place, this<br>technology will be used to augment LA's CT efforts and facilitate the exchange of information<br>from coast to coast.<br>Tour at FBI HQ<br>(S//SI) My tour at FBI HQ has been different from my experience at the field office in several<br>ways. First, I am working inside of a large SCIF with the analysts and agents that comprise the<br>Communications Analysis Unit. Although we still must pass only SECRET information to the field<br>offices, information can be shared freely with my colleagues in the CAU and it is easy to reach<br>back to NSA via secure communications. Secondly, CAU personnel have fairly extensive<br>experience with SIGINT and have already established a working relationship with the CT product<br>line at NSA. In fact, several CAU detailees are currently sitting with CT analysts in OPS2B.<br>(S//SI) But the biggest difference is that, after working through some policy-related questions, I<br>am now sitting here as an analyst and not in the representational role that I had at the field<br>office. This allows me to have access to more databases and analytic tools, which better equips<br>me to assist the CAU in their mission to uncover the domestic connections to international<br>terrorism and prevent potential attacks on U.S. soil before they can be carried out. For example,<br>the FBI routinely conducts call-chaining analysis on domestic numbers of interest. These<br>numbers are often in contact with foreign numbers, but until now the FBI had no way of knowing<br>if the foreign numbers had terrorist connections. As a result, potentially valuable leads were<br>frequently overlooked.<br>(S//SI) Now I am able to use NSA resources to analyze any foreign contacts and determine if<br>they could possibly be associated with terrorist activity. Additionally, the CT product line is<br>providing the CAU with a weekly listing of terrorism-related phone numbers, and we hope to be<br>able to soon do the same with e-mail addresses. So FBI analysts can now immediately tell if an<br>individual in the U.S. has any foreign terrorism-related contacts, which enables the FBI to better<br>protect our homeland by focusing their effort and resources appropriately.<br>(U//FOUO) This is an example of Transformation 2.0 in action and I believe it is a glimpse into<br>the future of NSA's relationship with FBI. I am proud to be a part of these information-sharing<br>success stories.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
