(U) The Fourth of July is fast approaching. We'd like to gather anecdotes from NSA'ers who were
overseas on that holiday, describing what they experienced at that time. For example, did they
congregate with other Americans for a celebration? Was the setting unusual?
(U) If we receive some interesting stories, we'll put them together and post them as a SID today
article to mark the holiday. Please send your comments to 
 and 
.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
