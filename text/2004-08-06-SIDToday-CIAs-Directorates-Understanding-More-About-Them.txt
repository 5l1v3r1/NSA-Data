Understanding More About Them<br>FROM: <br>Customer Account Manager for CIA (S112)<br>Run Date: 08/06/2004<br><br>(C) The CIA-NSA relationship is certainly complex and multi-faceted. Some of the complexity<br>stems from the diverse missions and resulting unique cultures in each of CIA's three main<br>directorates -- the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), the Directorate of Operations (DO), and the<br>Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&amp;T). Understanding the differences in these<br>organizations and their cultures may help when dealing with individuals or requests from each<br>directorate.<br>(S) The Directorate of Intelligence (DI) is the analytical arm of the CIA, charged with<br>providing timely, accurate, and objective analysis on the full range of national security threats<br>and foreign policy issues facing the United States. Functions of this directorate include providing<br>US policymakers with the information and analysis needed to carry out their mission of<br>formulating and implementing US national security policy and providing daily current intelligence<br>briefings to senior White House (Presidential Daily Briefing - PDB) and designated Cabinet-level<br>officials (Senior Executive Information Briefing - SEIB). Although there is certainly collaboration<br>between CIA/DI's analytic community and NSA's SIGINT analysts, the CIA/DI is mostly a SIGINT<br>customer using finished NSA/SID product as one of their most valuable sources in producing allsource intelligence products. Of the three CIA directorates, the analytic nature of CIA/DI's<br>culture makes it most like that of NSA/SID.<br>(S) The Directorate of Operations (DO) is the HUMINT-collection arm of the CIA. Even<br>though this directorate and SID both perform collection, the nature of the HUMINT business<br>creates a culture with some dramatic differences to SID's but also with some similarities. A<br>priority for both the DO and SID is protecting collection sources and methods. For the DO, this<br>means protecting people (assets) while SID protects technical sources of intelligence. As a result<br>of these differences and similarities, the DO and SID have very different relationships with<br>foreign partners. There are many examples of DO and SID partnerships with HUMINT and<br>SIGINT enabling each other -- almost essential to obtain the most valuable accesses in today's<br>world. In an effort to better understand and relate to a HUMINT organization, SID has detailed<br>many representatives or referents into the DO to handle specific issues related to each target<br>area.<br>(S) The Directorate of Science &amp; Technology (DS&amp;T) is the technical arm of the CIA. Its<br>mission is to access, collect, and exploit critical intelligence by applying innovative scientific,<br>engineering, and technical solutions. Some of the technical services provided by the DS&amp;T, such<br>as technical collection in support of HUMINT operations, require a very technical workforce -somewhat similar to NSA's technical workforce (electronics, signals, etc). As a result of these<br>similarities, there are some excellent examples of SID-DS&amp;T partnering in some areas and other<br>examples of "turf wars" due to real or perceived mission overlap. The DS&amp;T also possesses some<br>very different technical skills/disciplines (disguises, document replication, and audio collection<br>devices, etc.) which can complement SID operations. As in the case with the DO, SID has placed<br>several NSA representatives or referents in the DS&amp;T to facilitate the relationship in specific<br>mission areas.<br>(S//SI) Some joint CIA-NSA efforts , which actually include people from across CIA directorates<br>and SID organizations, offer the best examples of how these two agencies can work well<br>together. The Special Collection Service (SCS) is a joint NSA-CIA organization whose mission<br>is the covert collection of SIGINT from official U.S. establishments abroad. The Clandestine<br>SIGINT Program (ClanSIG), run by the jointly staffed Technology Management Office (TMO)<br>at CIA, provides numerous excellent examples of HUMINT enabling SIGINT and vice versa. In<br>addition to these long standing programs, a more recent example includes the SIGINT<br>proliferation cell -- physically located in the Counterproliferation Division (CPD) in CIA/DO but<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">jointly staffed with NSA/SID, CIA/DO and CIA/DI analysts.
