This knowledge, or how we<br>know what we know, is often what customers have in mind when they ask for "raw SIGINT."<br>What if we could capitalize on the time and effort put into documenting this knowledge and find<br>an easy and effective way to share it?<br>(U//FOUO) Allowing customers to access the information in our databases -- instead of SID<br>disseminating it to them narratively -- has many benefits. An interactive mechanism for<br>retrieving the data allows the customers to get the specific information they need, when they<br>need it. This format is more useful to them, because they can manipulate and analyze<br>information themselves. This also reduces the need for SID analysts to issue product reports and<br>respond to RFIs* -- saving time and effort.<br>(U//FOUO) For example, a directory of target-related facilities naturally lends itself to a<br>database structure. Rapidly changing sets of information are not easily shared via traditional<br>product reports: adding two names to a list of four hundred can be a difficult task. With<br>"Database Reporting", however, it's simply a built-in feature.<br>(S//SI) In July 2001, a joint S1/S2 team completed development of the PRC Defense Industries<br>database-reporting prototype (FIDIR**), which is accessible to external customers via Intelink.<br>Valuable intelligence that is typically gathered in a target office database was made available to<br>both internal Agency analysts and customers throughout the Intelligence Community. This<br>represents NSA's first instance of Intelink-base database COMINT reporting.<br>(S//SI) The prototype was a first step towards defining a "standardized" way of sharing SIGINT<br>fact. The next iteration, SCORPIOFORE, provides database reporting via NSAnet with planned<br>releases on Intelink and the Second Party Mall. The concept was introduced in March 2002 as an<br>interim-solution database reporting initiative on Iranian nuclear proliferation procurement<br>activities. It was in response to stated customer needs and information gaps on this high priority<br>target. OpSIGINT worked in partnership with S1 and S2 to create SCORPIOFORE, which should<br>be available in the next few months.<br>(S//SI) S1 is currently working on a scalable solution of this new concept which could be applied<br>to many different data sources. (More about this new architecture called 4S -- Structured<br>SIGINT Sharing Space -- is available at <br>or "go 4S".)<br>(S//SI) The ability to share SIGINT fact via Database Reporting will not replace narrative<br>reporting altogether; however, it does facilitate information sharing and provides a powerful<br>vehicle for analysts to add more information into shared analytic space.<br>(S//SI) Notes: <br>* RFI = Request for Information <br>** FIDIR = Factories and Institutes Directory<br>(U) Do you have comments on this topic?
