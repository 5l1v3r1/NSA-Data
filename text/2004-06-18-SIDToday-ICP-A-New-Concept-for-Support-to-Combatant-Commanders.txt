Based on the study "Taking Stock of Defense Intelligence"<br>undertaken at his direction last fall, and lessons learned from Operation Enduring Freedom<br>(OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the USD(I) has introduced a new concept called<br>"Intelligence Campaign Planning." The effective support of Combatant Commanders<br>requires support agencies to create very detailed plans and the USD(I) has initiated an effort to<br>come up with a comprehensive methodology for developing an integrated, fully coordinated, and<br>executable Intelligence Campaign Plan (ICP).<br>(S) To help focus the ICP effort, a decision was made to develop a plan in support of the<br>Combined Forces Command (CFC) Korea -- specifically OPLAN 5027. On 2 March 2004, the<br>Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence &amp; Warfighting Support, LTG Boykin, and<br>Joint Chiefs of Staff J2, MG Burgess, co-hosted a conference at the Pentagon to design the way<br>ahead.<br>(S) Representatives from the Services, a number of Commands, and the Intelligence Community<br>attended. BG DeFreitas, United States Forces Korea (USFK) J2, provided an overview of OPLAN<br>5027, outlining the campaign's operational objectives and identifying the key Priority<br>Intelligence Requirements for each phase of operations. The group agreed to follow a mission<br>analysis format for information gathering with the goal of producing an ICP that supports the<br>CFC Commander's Ten Critical Fights across all four phases of the OPLAN.<br>(S) Following the kick-off session, COL <br> of the USD(I)'s Office and LTC <br> of the Joint Staff J2 facilitated VTCs in late-March and mid-April to review the progress<br>of the mission analysis being conducted. It was decided that the ICP Working Group would take<br>advantage of NSA's Rock Drill 5 (see related article ) being held in Korea 19-23 April to meet in<br>Korea the last week of April.<br>(S) BG DeFreitas hosted the CFC Korea ICP Conference at the Yongsan Post in Seoul from 28-30<br>April. COLs <br>and <br> from the Office of the USD(I) directed the activities.<br>Participants included representatives from the Combat Support Agencies--e.g. the Defense<br>Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and NSA<br>(participants from NSAW, KRSOC, and SUSLAK*); the Services; a number of personnel from the<br>CFC/USFK J2 and J5 staffs; and others. Participants divided into focus groups and achieved the<br>objective of the conference -- to establish a methodology and baseline of information -- was<br>achieved.<br>(S) An aggressive timeline for continuing the CFC Korea ICP effort has been set: the groups are<br>to complete their mission analysis by the end of June; in early July the results will be briefed to<br>Dr. Cambone and GEN LaPorte (the directors of the Combat Support Agencies are expected to<br>attend); the groups then will develop functional Courses of Action that are to be completed by<br>the end of October; between October and December, a draft ICP will be prepared/coordinated<br>and presented to Dr. Cambone/GEN LaPorte; and an ICP "Rock Drill" is planned for January<br>2005 which will lead to the refinement of the ICP.<br>(S) As the ICP concept evolves, it is expected to be the comprehensive methodology for<br>integrating intelligence into the Combatant and Joint Task Force Commander's adaptive planning<br>and operations processes. In fact, an ICP for CONPLAN 5077 already has been discussed at<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">USPACOM and lessons learned from the current CFC Korea effort are to be provided in the<br>August timeframe so that a mission analysis can begin.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>KRSOC = Kunia Regional Security Operations Center <br>SUSLAK = Special United States Liaison Advisor-Korea <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
