CNE Access to BELGACOM GRX Operator: (GREEN) This work has been very
successful and has enabled not only CNE but also Ops by identifying a large
number of VPN exploitation opportunities. The NAC held a joint with 
Ops (OP SOCIALIST II) to identify the huge extent of opportunity that this work has
identified. Work continues on a reduced number of ONE requirements.

MERION ZETA (support for NEP and Ops teams): This surge which included
contributors from other areas - was a continuation of the involvement in the
project to exploit Belgacom's GRX network, as required by the Mobile Theme. This
particular surge, which was completed successfully, included efforts to: identify the
mobile network operators that connect to the Belgacom network via 
characterise each VPN and determine those that contain GTP: facilitate the

processing of these GTP events to enable the extraction and use of target selectors;
conduct access analysis to identify the best point of access for the key networks;
make recommendations for further sustained GTFJ processing.

- Successful VERACIOUS Project-enabling conducted; key requirements for upcoming work
identi?ed, which are key to reducing risk exposure. Network Analysis on BELGACOM hugely
successful enabling exploitation.
