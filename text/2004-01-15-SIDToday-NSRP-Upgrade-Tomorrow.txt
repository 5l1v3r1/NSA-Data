DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) NSRP Upgrade Tomorrow<br>FROM:<br>and <br>Information Needs (S111)<br>Run Date: 01/15/2004<br>FROM: <br> and<br>Information Needs (S111) <br><br> <br><br>(U//FOUO) On 16 January 2004, the National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) will be<br>upgraded to incorporate the IC-wide National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) topics and<br>priorities in accordance with National Security Council and DCI directives. NIPF replaces the old<br>PDD-35-based Community Priority System (CPS) topics and priorities for all Active Standing and<br>Limited Duration Information Needs (INs) and for all new INs. You can find out more about NIPF<br>at the link listed below. A complete list of the changes to NSRP is at the end of this notification.<br>(U//FOUO) What does this mean for users of INs? Most INs will get new versions and new<br>priorities. This will affect citations on reporting. New versions won't generate an error in<br>SKYCAST, but the new priorities might. The NSRP team is helping analysts by preparing a web<br>site where you can find out how your current key INs will change with the rollover. This site is<br>linked to the NSRP secure tools site (see below for links). In addition, a new field in the<br>Topic/Geopolitical/Priority table will provide the correct reporting citation to be used for that<br>combination. You can copy and paste directly from the IN into your reporting tools. Lastly, the<br>PLUS team will be closely monitoring citation errors during the rollover period and do everything<br>they can to minimize unnecessary error messages by making what corrections they can. Error<br>messages will be suspended for a brief period as we monitor the impact of these changes.<br>(U//FOUO) Changes to INs by the NIPF Transition on 16 January:<br>1.  All Active and On-Hold Standing and Limited-Duration INs will get a new version number<br>and most will get new national and SIGINT priorities.<br>2.  All Active and On-Hold Standing and Limited-Duration INs will be converted to NIPF SubTopics<br>3.  New TOPIC Identifiers will be displayed next to the topic/sub-topic names.<br>4.  Research INs will NOT be updated; they will continue to reflect CPS Topics<br>5.  All new INs will contain NIPF sub-topics<br>(U//FOUO) The development of this new version of NSRP has been focused on a successful NIPF<br>implementation. Other than NIPF, only a few new features have been added. They include the<br>ability to export INs into html format from the NPI client, showing the correct reporting citations<br>in the IN, and more flexibility in the Basic Query Tool. A follow-on upgrade containing other<br>improvements and any heretofore-undiscovered bug fixes will follow in February 2004.<br>(U//FOUO) Important contact information and links:<br>NSRP Division Office:<br>or <br>, <br>NSRP Help Desk or<br>@helpdesk.www.nsa <br>NSRP or "go nsrp" <br>NSRP Secure Web Tools Site (requires PKI certificate) <br>NIPF or "go S17" <br>NIPF Intelink Site (Requires INTELINK access) <br>PLUS or "go plus" <br><br> or<br><br>@nsa <br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
