DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) The Bald Truth: Helping Your Leaders Make Decisions that Stick<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 03/18/2004<br><br>(U) I bet you will agree that we have a problem<br>with revisiting decisions. It seems like every time<br>a decision is announced around here, there is a<br>retraction and a revisit within 24 hrs. Can you relate? I can. Sadly,<br>I have issued plenty of retractions myself. Honestly, many were<br>due to my mistakes -- but others were the result of a faulty<br>decision-making process. Did you ever wonder what causes this<br>and what we could do about it? Never fear, Dr. Berlin has a<br>diagnosis and a prescription.<br>(U) The Symptoms and the Disease<br>(U) Most leaders have to make decisions in uncertainty.<br>Uncertainty exists in a lack of knowledge of our current state and a<br>murky prediction about the future. Still, leaders have to make<br>decisions anyway -- waiting for perfect information is not a smart<br>thing to do since it never really arrives. We need to make our<br>decisions with some lesser amount of information, somewhere<br>around 70 to 90 percent. But the problem is that we make<br>decisions with way less than 70 percent, and the equation changes<br>from a risk to a gamble somewhere around the 50 percent mark.<br>When the leader feels he is in the gamble region, he is particularly<br>vulnerable to the nugget virus . That is, when a single nugget of<br>new information comes in, the leader's confidence in the decision<br>is shaken and a revisit is in the making.<br>(U) One reason this happens is the way the leader's immune<br>system is suppressed by the point solution briefing . Many an<br>outstanding, up and coming, subordinate can craft up an advocacy<br>briefing that spells out the efficacy of the answer, the single<br>answer. Our culture promotes the point solution briefing because<br>the antibodies to the answer will form early if the idea is<br>unpopular to the established status quo, so it is best to keep it<br>quiet and don't even mention the other possibilities lest they spur<br>on the antibodies (I guess I am overdoing the medical analogy a<br>bit, but bear with me). Anyway, I often see great ideas literally<br>sprung on the leadership with no notice. Ever wanting to<br>encourage innovation, our leaders hate to say no to a good idea<br>and the decision is made to go ahead (usually with funding and<br>personnel support to follow - not further specified). As we work out<br>the details, the nuggets begin to arrive and the inevitable revisit<br>takes place. We immediately go into the paralysis-by-analysis<br>mode and everything grinds to a halt. I got the T-shirt on this one.<br>(U) The Cure<br>(U) Well the first thing is get the good staff work done in the first<br>place (odd that a chief of staff would advocate for this, no?). This<br>means producing the good options brief rather than the evil<br>point solution brief . The options brief is really an intellectually<br>honest depiction of the many ways to skin this cat. It usually<br><br> SERIES: <br>The Bald Truth<br>1.  The Bald Truth:<br>Technical Leadership<br>2.  The Bald Truth: The<br>Sweet Conspiracy<br>3.

Letters to the Editor:<br>Helping Your Leaders<br>Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br>6.  Letter to the Editor:<br>Helping Your Leaders<br>Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br><br> </p>contains, among others, the "do nothing" option, the partial option,<br>the full option, the cheap option, the opposing organization's<br>option and the out of the box option. The idea is to present the<br>landscape of solutions to the decision maker. The options brief lists<br>the criterion by which the leader would judge the decision and<br>evaluates the pros and cons of each option according to the<br>criteria. Criteria could be:<br>cheaper,<br>faster,<br>more efficient,<br>supports others, etc.<br>The result is a matrix of options versus criterion that shows the<br>total picture including resource implications. Please do me a favor:<br>if there is a resource cost, make a well-staffed recommendation as<br>to the source of the resource. It is only half a decision if we identify<br>a need and not the source of satisfaction.<br>(U) Now, there is a place for advocacy here. At the end of the<br>options discussion, you are expected to make a staff<br>recommendation on which of the options you would recommend,<br>being careful to list the pitfalls and risks for each option. It is also<br>important to explain why the decision needs to be made now. The<br>timing of a decision is a legitimate factor in the discussion especially at the strategic level. Be ready to answer the question,<br>why now? If you are smart and a little bit lucky, your leader will<br>select an option, decide and move on without looking back.<br>(U) How does this prescription help your leader make sticky<br>decisions? Well, it inoculates the decision maker from the nugget<br>virus . With a good view of the landscape, the leader can evaluate<br>the impact of the newly arrived nugget. The leader can determine<br>if the new information is significant enough to warrant a legitimate<br>re-look or just an insignificant additional piece of data. The wellstaffed options brief keeps your decision maker in the risk regime<br>and out of the gambling casino.
