DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) 'Dropping Anchor' in Anchorage<br>FROM:<br>NSA/CSS NORAD/NORTHCOM Alaska Representative (NCNAR)<br>Run Date: 11/04/2004<br>FROM: <br>NSA/CSS NORAD/NORTHCOM Alaska Representative (NCNAR) <br> the NSA Representative in Alaska, works at Elmendorf<br>Air Force Base in Anchorage. He describes what life is like in the<br>region... (U//FOUO)<br>(U) Alaska or "Alyeska" stems from an Aleut word that means "The<br>Great Land," a very appropriate name. The state comprises about<br>1/5th the territory of the United States, has five times the coastline<br>of the "Lower 48," and prior to the Alaska Territory gaining<br>statehood in 1959, many wanted to create two states -- just so<br>Texas would be the third-largest state. Every day when the tide<br>(second-highest in the world) goes out, Alaska gains more<br>landmass than the state of Texas. A map of Alaska overlaid on the<br>Lower 48 shows extremities spanning from coast to coast -Ketchikan aligns with Savannah, Anchorage aligns with Kansas<br>City, and Shemya aligns with Los Angeles.<br>(U) In 1935, aviation pioneer Gen Billy Mitchell testified before<br>Congress that "Alaska is the most central place in the world for<br>aircraft, and that is true either for Europe, Asia, or North America.<br>I believe in the future, that he who holds Alaska will hold the<br>world, and I think it is the most important strategic place in the<br>world." Several cargo carriers already have created hubs at<br>Anchorage's Ted Stevens International Airport for just that reason<br>-- to take advantage of short polar routes to other areas of the<br>world.<br>(U) Areas such as San Diego and Norfolk can have noticeably good<br>relations with large, nearby military installations, but nowhere is<br>solid military/civilian synergy more manifest than throughout<br>Alaska. Notwithstanding the gold rush, the territory was largely<br>developed by the military, and cementing the foundation was the<br>buy-in from the native Alaskans who first acted as scouts after the<br>Japanese invasion of the Aleutians during WWII. Natives later<br>became members of the National Guard, and today constitute a<br>good share of those positions in the bush ("not serviced by roads").<br>About one in five Alaskans throughout the state has some affiliation<br>with the military -- that figure becomes about one in three in<br>Anchorage.<br>(U) Anchorage is located in what is referred to as the "Anchorage<br>Bowl" because of the protection afforded by the Chugach Mts., the<br>Alaska Range, and the warm Japanese Current, which provide the<br>milder climate for Alaska's "banana belt." Rich alluvial soil and long<br>hours of summer sunlight produce world-record flowers and<br>vegetables -- this year's Alaska State Fair featured a 707-lb<br>pumpkin. Temperatures range from the 80s to the minus 30s - but<br>not for protracted periods. I've been colder in 35 degrees in Seattle<br>than in 20 below here. Pick a subject.

'Dropping Anchor' in<br>Anchorage<br><br> </p>Borealis, lakes, mountains, rivers, glaciers, wildlife, quality of life<br>issues, and friendly people -- when someone in a store offers to<br>help, and he doesn't even work there, you know you are in Alaska.<br>(U) Outdoors takes on a new meaning in Alaska because there is so<br>much of it -- flying in, passengers cross hundreds of miles of<br>uninhabited land. The road system, however is inversely<br>proportionate to the territory with only one major north-south<br>highway, but there are plenty of secondary (unpaved) roads that<br>allow for a lot of driving/RV-ing. There are hundreds of miles of<br>hiking/biking trails, and in the winter even more room without<br>trails. Hunting, fishing, boating, skiing... you name it, Alaska has it.<br><br>(U) Is having to ring twice for room service your idea of roughing<br>it? Would you prefer something less strenuous, more genteel? My<br>wife and I attended "St. Matthew's Passion" in English, in its<br>entirety, with two full orchestras, two adult choirs and a children's<br>choir -- a once-in-a-generation, if not lifetime, experience. It was<br>performed in Anchorage, NOT in New York, Washington DC, Los<br>Angeles, Chicago, or Dallas! The arts are well represented here as<br>evidenced by a robust concert season and world-class entertainers<br>who regularly cycle through. Every summer from May through<br>September, Anchorage puts on a Saturday Market that is easily the<br>equivalent of the Sugar Loaf Mountain crafts festival in the DC<br>metropolitan area. Pick a medium... wood, metal, plastic, fur,<br>ivory, gold, papier mache, stone grass, glass baleen, etc. and you<br>can find world-class artisans displaying their wares.<br>(U) Downside (for some) is remoteness, i.e. the distance from<br>family and friends in the Lower 48. Daylight can exceed 19 Â½<br>hours around the summer solstice, and many newcomers find that<br>disconcerting -- but that's why God invented eyelids. During the<br>winter, there is only about 5 Â½ hours of daylight, which can result<br>in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in some who are susceptible.<br>Nevertheless, full-spectrum lights, light boxes and plenty of activity<br>can counteract those effects.<br>(U) When we first arrived, locals could identify us as cheechakos<br>("newcomers") because every time we stepped outside to look at<br>the scenery, we'd say, "Gee..." Sourdoughs ("pioneers") would tell<br>us, "When you've been here awhile, you'll begin to say, 'Just<br>another pretty mountain.'" That hasn't happened yet, and it's not<br>likely to. Even lifelong Alaskans constantly remark, "Did you see<br>the sunrise this morning? Last night the sky was like a large, green<br>dancing curtain." All in all, if you spend any length of time in<br>Alaska, you may love it or hate it, but you are not likely to forget<br>it.<br>(U//FOUO) Here's an "EXECmessage" about the switch from<br>NCPRA (NSA/CSS Pacific Representative Alaska) to NCNAR:<br>.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are thinking of applying for a field position, see<br>the Field Vacancy Announcements .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
