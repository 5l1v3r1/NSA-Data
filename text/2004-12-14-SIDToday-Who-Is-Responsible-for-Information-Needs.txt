You may have wondered, "Who is responsible for these INs?" The answer is, S111 Customer<br>Service Managers, also known as CSMs.<br>(U//FOUO) The CSMs in S111 are a very diverse group of people comprised of collection<br>managers, intelligence analysts, data flow managers, signals analysts and linguists. CSMs are<br>responsible for the end-to-end health of the customer's INs. Some CSMs focus on and respond<br>to INs in a particular region of the world such as Southeast Asia or Middle East/North Africa.<br>Other CSMs specialize on a particular topic such as Information Operations or Counterterrorism<br>INs. The CSMs work closely with counterparts in SID and IAD, and take the appropriate action<br>on the customers' INs to provide the best support possible.<br>(U//FOUO) CSMs play a critical role in the Information Needs process, as they interact with the<br>external customers and members from the SIGINT Requirements Validation and Evaluation<br>Subcommittee (SIRVES) to understand and cultivate their INs. CSMs often coordinate with<br>members of SIRVES to rework a duplicative IN by identifying other INs that are similar and<br>suggesting a course of action to take. They collaborate with SIRVES when it comes to<br>negotiating with a customer regarding a due date for a LOE or Research IN response that cannot<br>be met or needs to be extended.<br>(U//FOUO) CSMs also partner with Senior Executive Account Managers (SEAMs) and Account<br>Managers (AMs) to ensure a healthy, successful relationship with the customers in regards to<br>their current and future requirements for INs. Within NSA, CSMs collaborate with personnel from<br>the SID Production Lines and Data Acquisition on the IN and the crafting of the Level of Effort<br>(LOE) Statement.<br>(U//FOUO) LOEs are a very important part of the Information Needs process. The LOE is the<br>vehicle used by the Unified Cryptologic System (UCS) to respond to INs. The LOE is a<br>characterization of how the SIGINT system can respond to an intelligence need given current<br>priorities, resource constraints, and legitimate capabilities. The LOE seeks to provide customers<br>with a realistic assessment of the SIGINT system's ability to satisfy an IN from a production and<br>dissemination perspective. Sometimes the LOE contains aspects of access and collection, too.<br>LOEs are fluid documents and are routinely updated.<br>(U//FOUO) The S111 CSMs are the stewards of the INs and LOEs, managing over 3,200 active<br>INs in the National SIGINT Requirements Process, making each day as a Customer Service<br>Manager busy, diverse, and challenging. The CSM role allows one to glean an overview of the<br>entire SIGINT System's capabilities and resources, be exposed to all collection disciplines, and<br>interact with analysts, collection managers, and customers from the entire Intelligence<br>Community.<br>(U//FOUO) Being a CSM is rewarding, knowing that you have contributed to the War on Global<br>Terrorism (GWOT) and supported the war fighter through the National SIGINT Requirements<br>Process.
