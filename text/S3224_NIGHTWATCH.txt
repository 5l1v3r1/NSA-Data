NIGHTWATCH

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) NIGHTWATCH is a portable computer with

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The current
implementation of NIGHTWATCH consists of
a general-purpose PC inside of a shielded
case. The PC has PCI digitizing and clock
cards to provide the needed interface and
accurate clocking required for video
reconstruction. It also has:

•	horizontal sync, vertical sync and video
outputs to drive an external, multi-sync
monitor.

•	video input

•	spectral analysis up to 150 kHz to provide for indications of horizontal and
vertical sync frequencies

•	frame capture and forwarding

•	PCMCIA cards for program and data storage

•	horizontal sync locking to keep the display set on the NIGHTWATCH display.

•	frame averaging up to 2A16 (65536) frames.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The video output from an appropriate collection
system, such as a CTX4000, PHOTOANGLO, or general-purpose receiver, is
connected to the video input on the NIGHTWATCH system. The user, using the
appropriate tools either within NIGHTWATCH or externally, determines the
horizontal and vertical sync frequencies of the targeted monitor. Once the user
matches the proper frequencies, he activates "Sync Lock" and frame averaging
to reduce noise and improve readability of the targeted monitor. If warranted, the
user then forwards the displayed frames over a network to NSAW, where
analysts can look at them for intelligence purposes.

Unit Cost: N/A

Status: This system has reached the end of its service life. All work concerning
the NIGHTWATCH system is strictly for maintenance purposes. This system is
slated to be replaced by the VIEWPLATE system.
