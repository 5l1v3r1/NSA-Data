(S) NSA/CSS/JFCC-NW National Initiative Brief Sheet

1.	(S//NF) You arc being indoctrinated on SENTRY EAGLE, the NSA/CSS and
JFCC-NW's compartmcntcd program protecting the highest and most
sensitive level of information related to NSA/CSS’s and JFCC-NW’s support
to the U.S. Government’s efforts to protect America’s cyberspace. America’s
cyberspace is the combination of U.S. National Security Systems, Military
Systems, Intelligence Systems, Federal Government Systems, Critical
Infrastructure Systems and all other U.S. systems (private industry, academia
and private citizen.)

2.	(S//NF) NSA/CSS’s effort to protect America’s cyberspace encompasses the
combination of all abilities to detect nation and non-nation attacks on U.S.
cyberspace via active and passive SIGINT and Information Assurance means.
JFCC-NW’s effort to protect America’s cyberspace encompasses the efforts to
plan, synchronize, and when tasked, attack an adversary’s cyber space via
Computer Network Attack. The combination of these two efforts constitutes
NSA/CSS’s and JFCC-NW’s Core Computer Network Operations (CNO)
Secrets.

3.	(TS//S17NF) In order for NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW to accomplish, along with
other U.S. and foreign government agcncics’clcmcnts, the protection of
America’s cyberspace, NSA/JFCC-NW must combine the full capabilities of
authorized Computer Network Operations capabilities (SIGINT, Computer
Network Exploitation (CNE); Information Assurance, Computer Network
Defense (CND), and Network Warfare, Computer Network Attack (CNA))
and all supporting activities.

4.	(TS//S17NF) SENTRY EAGLE and its subordinate programs protect the
combined facts related to NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW’s abilities to conduct
CNO operations. It encompasses the most sensitive aspects of NSA/CSS’s:
relationships with industry (U.S. and foreign) and the U.S. Information
Operations/CNO community; ability to exploit enciphered communications;
ability to conduct CNE; ability to conduct CND; and, relationships with
Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Agencies.

5.	(TS//SL7NF) These NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW Core CNO Secrets arc being
provided to you based upon your “need to know" as determined by the
Director, NSA/Chief, Central Security Service and Commander, JFCC-NW.
While many of the facts in this briefing are contained in separate NSA/CSS
Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECIs) or DOD Special Access
Programs (SAPs) structures, no other program combines the totality of all
these facts into one overarching program. The facts contained in this program
constitute a combination of the greatest number of highly sensitive facts
related to NSA/CSS’s overall cryptologic mission. As such, depending upon

TOP SECRET'//COMINT//NOFORN//20310524

your mission nccd-to-know or management position, you may be read on for
one, a combination of two or more, or all aspects of SENTRY EAGLE.

6.	(TS/7SL7NF) Individuals briefed into SENTRY EAGLE may not share
information regarding this program with those not read into this program, or
with foreign nationals, including those with whom NSA/'CSS has Second and
Third Party relationships. Depending upon a specific fact, you may share
such a fact with foreign partners as noted on the SENTRY EAGLE or
subordinate classification guides as paragraph marked or within specific
NSA/CSS SAP or ECI channels. Under no circumstances will you share the
totality of SENTRY EAGLE nor facts that arc marked NOFORN.

7.	(S) SENTRY EAGLE material must be protected within this compartment and
discussed only with cleared personnel on a nccd-to-know basis. Disclosure of
SENTRY EAGLE information tonon-indoctrinatcd personnel may result in
disciplinary action to include criminal prosecution. When sharing SENTRY
EAGLE compartmcntcd information, it will be protected with PK1 when
transmitted via electronic means or with sealed, by name envelopes when
transmitted via hard copy.

(U) INFORMATION REQUIRING SENTRY EAGLE PROTECTION:

(TS//SI//NF) Details related to the combination of NSA/CSS’s and JFCC-NW’s abilities
to conduct CNO in the defense of America’s cyberspace.

(U) VALUE OF SEE:

(TS//SI//NF) Protecting sensitive NSA/CSS industrial and human intelligence
relationships; SIGINT exploitation of adversary computers and computer networks and
infrastructure and their use of encipherment; Information Assurance defense of U.S.
Government National Security Systems; and, JFCC-NW’s Computer Network Attack
mission capabilities.

(U) JUSTIFICATION FOR SENTRY EAGLE PROTECTION:

(TS//SI//NF) Unauthorized disclosure of NSA/CSS relationships with industry (U.S. and
foreign) and the U.S. Information Operations/CNO community; ability to exploit
enciphered communications; ability to conduct CNE; ability to conduct CND; and,
relationships with Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Agencies will cause exceptionally
grave damage to U.S. national security. The loss of this information could critically
compromise highly sensitive cryptologic U.S. and foreign relationships, multi-year past
and future NS A investments, and the ability to exploit foreign adversary cyberspace
while protecting U.S cyberspace.
