Here's part one...<br>(S) " NSA/CSS does not have enough Cryptologic Language Analysts with the skill level<br>necessary to prosecute cryptologic language missions, especially in the Global War on Terrorism<br>." This statement is the opening line of an NSA report to the Joint Requirements Oversight<br>Council on the status of our language capabilities. The ability to understand a target's language<br>is more crucial than it has ever been, and this shortcoming must be rectified. In this special<br>mini-series, we'll look at the nature of the problem and describe some of the NSA/CSS initiatives<br>to fix it.<br>(C) First, what kinds of cryptologic language skills does the SIGINT System need? The NSA/CSS<br>Senior Language Authority (SLA), together with target offices and experts, documents all<br>cryptologic language missions worldwide (2300+), along with the language skill level required to<br>prosecute those missions. Currently 85% of the NSA/CSS cryptologic missions require a<br>skill level of 3 or better , meaning that the cryptologic language analyst must be able to read<br>and listen "between the lines" to unformatted, unpredictable discourse that includes analysis,<br>commentary, opinion, arguments, diplomatic exchanges, and extended outbursts. In addition to<br>the level-3 nature of the discourse itself, the language analyst, as the unintended recipient of<br>the message, must deal with "Signals Intelligence factors" such as garbled text, incomplete<br>messages, lack of redundancy in the exchange, uncertain context, and distortion. The demands<br>on the language analyst are high.<br>(S) The SLA also maintains a real-time Language Readiness Index (LRI), which shows the<br>percentage of cryptologic language missions being prosecuted by "qualified" language analysts.<br>(There are over 6500 Cryptologic Language Analysts - CLAs - worldwide.) CLAs are considered<br>"qualified" if their language test scores are equal to or higher than the language level required<br>for their job. The overall worldwide LRI is 51%, with 80% representing a minimum acceptable<br>risk. In other words, only half of the missions are being prosecuted by qualified<br>personnel .<br>(C) The number of mission areas that demand high-level language proficiency continues to<br>increase, with over 25% of current cryptologic missions requiring a level higher than 3, requiring<br>the CLA to read and listen "beyond the lines." The language level for many missions, particularly<br>those related to counterterrorism and force protection, continues to be measured at the<br>extremely difficult 4/4+ level because the targets "talk around" the subject and use what<br>appears to be almost gibberish metalanguage and idiolects. Targets are communicating via a<br>variety of 21st century technologies, using very colloquial speech and writing in their particular<br>dialects, rather than the standard written language.<br>(C) The 2/2 language standard of yesterday can no longer suffice to provide the actionable<br>intelligence that is critically needed to support our troops and high-level policy leaders. In April<br>2002, DIRNSA documented for the record that the operational standard required for NSA/CSS<br>cryptologic language work is level 3/3. (See announcement .)<br>(C) As you can see, the demands are great... but NSA/CSS is taking steps to get the language<br>capabilities it needs.
