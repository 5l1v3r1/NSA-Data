As our DIA visitors were briefed on activities within Data<br>Acquisition, including the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC), Link Access,<br>Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES) and Tailored Access Operations (TAO), many<br>examples of the similar challenges both agencies experience crystallized. Several<br>representatives from the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) and from Analysis &amp;<br>Production were also present.<br>(C) For example, both Data Acquisition and DIA counterparts are investigating ways to measure<br>progress from an end-to-end mission management perspective. Each is challenged with keeping<br>up with the fast pace of technology (remember the horn graph?) by developing ways to exploit<br>new, emerging forms of communications -- without losing sight of the more common<br>technologies that are still used around the world by our targets. Each must find a way to ensure<br>that collection results in delivering relevant, actionable, timely intelligence to our common<br>customers. Each organization is addressing ways to eliminate or refine collection of irrelevant<br>data. And both agencies see the need to go far beyond just coordination of their individual<br>activities -- integration into each other's operations is the key to truly be effective.<br>(C) As a result, the CSRC is working with DIA representatives and with the CRD Customer<br>Account Manager to find ways to work more closely. The possibilities range from Collection<br>Officer exchanges to permanent integrees, as well as collaborative efforts against particular<br>targets. This will result in a closer collaboration between DA and DIA to fill common gaps, to<br>address mutual challenges and to build an effective partnership that reduces redundancy and<br>increases effectiveness.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
