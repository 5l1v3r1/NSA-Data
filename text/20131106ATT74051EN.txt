Dear Mr Lopez Aguilar

Re: Invitation to participate in the European Parliament Libe Committee inquiry
on Electronic Mass Surveillance of EU Citzens

Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2013 and for the kind invitation for BT to
appear at a LIBE Committee Hearing on either 7 or 11 November 2013.

We believe that questions relating to national security and any associated matters
about surveillance are for governments and most appropriately addressed to them;
and not to telecommunications service providers. Having said that, we can offer
reassurance that we do comply with the law wherever we operate and we do not
disclose customer data in any jurisdiction unless legally required to do so.

We fully understand the importance and topicality of the issues you set out. However,
any BT representative at a Hearing would not be able to add further to the statement
in the previous paragraph. We must therefore, with regret, decline your invitation.

Yours sincerely

L. ou.

LW STONE
