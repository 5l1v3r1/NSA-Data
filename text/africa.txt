(S//SI//REL) The |SA* is a joint US-German SIGDEV operation conducted from a
German SIGINT facility. It has been filling collection gaps for the US-run European

1 of 3

Security Operations Center's (ESOC) counterterrorism effort, as well as other
African missions, for over a year now** So far in 2007, NSA has produced thirteen
Africa-related SIGINT reports fromJSA collection, a success which has opened the
door to greater cooperation at JSA on the African target set.

(S//SI//REL) Mangfall Kaserne in Bavaria, home to JSA.

(S//SI//REL) ESOC and JSA: A Logical Match

(S//SI//REL) Due to higher priority ongoing tasks for Iraq and Afghanistan, ESOC
(see background) has had difficulty in getting collection resources to survey for
African signals. As a result, ESOC has been investigating possible Third Party
relationships to leverage partner accesses and linguistic capabilities, DND is both a
trusted partner and a very modern and capable SIGINT service, which lessens
concerns about sharing capabilities and SIGINT selectors with this partner as
opposed to other potential African partners, JSA's collection resources, as well as
BND's overlapping requirements regarding North Africa, made JSA an obvious
choice to quickly respond to ESOC's SIGDEV requirements,

(S//SI//REL) JSA Collects Against Africa

(S//SI//REL) In fall of 2006, JSA began collecting email traffic related to
GSM infrastructure, producing a number of SIGDEV-related reports, Then in the
summer of 2007, ESOC requested that JSA perform a survey of six satellites in
search of specific North African communications. During the course of the survey,
JSA located and initiated collection on^^^^^|GSM signals carrying
communications. In October 2007, ESOC issued its first CT SIGINT report from
JSA's GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) collection, In addition to
supporting ESOC, JSA is now collectingsignals in support of
NSAW's CT mission,

(U) Overlapping Requirements

(S//SI//REL) NSA and DND have similar SIGINT requirements regarding Africa,
DND has standing intelligence requirements for various political and humanitarian
issues throughout Africa, BND's current priorities in Africa are Sudan, Algeria, and
Somalia, In Sudan, BND is collecting two different GSM networks at another
FORNSAT facility, and using the metadata to track targets, Germany is very
interested in the peace process in Darfur and southern Sudan, Regarding Algeria,
BND has been processing border guard communications fromJSA collection, but
these signals appear to be migrating to a new data network, requiring a new
processing capability, DND HQs analysts are eagerly awaiting a processing solution
in order to more fully exploit these internal Algerian communications. For Somalia,
Germany has forces in the Horn of Africa region supporting Operation Enduring
Freedom, and is very interested in the political and humanitarian issues
surrounding Somalia,

(U) Future

(S//SI//REL) NSA analysts at JSA are working with CSRC (Collection Strategies and
Requirements Center)-Europe and NSA/CSS Representative AFRICQM to explore
new areas where JSA can support overlapping African SIGINT requirements from

2 of 3

NSA and DND.

(U) Notes:

* (S//SI//REL) "JSA" stands for ' Joint SIGINT Activity," It is operated by NSA and
the Dundesnachrichtendienst (DND ■ German Foreign Intelligence Service) at the
German SIGINT facility Mangfall Kaserne in Davaria, Any association of NSA with
Mangfall Kaserne is SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY
