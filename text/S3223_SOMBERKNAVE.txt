SOMBERKNAVE

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL) SOMBERKNAVE is Windows XP wireless software implant
that provides covert internet connectivity for isolated targets.

08/05/08

(TS//SI//REL) SOMBERKNAVE is a software implant that surreptitiously routes
TCP traffic from a designated process to a secondary network via an unused
embedded 802.11 network device. If an Internet-connected wireless Access
Point is present, SOMBERKNAVE can be used to allow OLYMPUS or
VALIDATOR to “call home” via 802.11 from an air-gapped target computer. If
the 802.11 interface is in use by the target, SOMBERKNAVE will not attempt
to transmit.

(TS//SI//REL) Operationally, VALIDATOR initiates a call home.
SOMBERKNAVE triggers from the named event and tries to associate with an
access point. If connection is successful, data is sent over 802.11 to the ROC.
VALIDATOR receives instructions, downloads OLYMPUS, then disassociates
and gives up control of the 802.11 hardware. OLYMPUS will then be able to
communicate with the ROC via SOMBERKNAVE, as long as there is an
available access point.
