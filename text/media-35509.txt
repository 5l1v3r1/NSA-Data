Part 1 - Experiment Overview

Business Case_______________________________________________________________________

Detail the nature of the Experiment as a high level plain English description. Refrain from using overly
technical terms if possible. Justify briefly why this Experiment should run, with a high level
summary of Experiment, Conditions, De-risking effort, Business Case and Expected
Outcomes/Benefits.

As part of the Joint Capability Activity (JCA) in partnership with GCHQ, experiments
are to be conducted within the Joint Capability Experiment (JCE) to test the
robustness, scalability and interoperability of cryptanalytic services integrated into
the corporate high speed DNI architectures of each agency. The cryptanalytic
services experiment will explore a new hardware configuration for sensitive
cryptanalytic mission applications integrated into a secure processing enclave
interfacing to the corporate high speed DNI architecture. This will also include the
testing of hardware accelerated decryption at the frontend. The business case for
running this experiment is to demonstrate the following:

-	Stress the processing capability under heavy load of “tasked” common
internet encryption technologies

-	Test the throughput capability of common internet encryption
technologies processing including:

•	Higher bandwidth common internet encryption technologies
streams

•	Throughput of ISLANDTRANSPORT messaging support for CA
Service requests to NSAW LONGHAUL key recovery service

•	The temporary storage of encrypted data while waiting for a
response from LONGHAUL

-	Test the Hardware accelerated (CAVIUM card) common internet
encryption technologies processing component

-	Test the impact of XKEYSCORE as Stage 2 of TURMOIL for follow on
processing of exploited common internet encryption technologies
streams

Plan

The cryptanalytic Services processing experiment will consist of several additive
experiments. The first two will mostly consist of preparatory work. The subsequent
experiment will explore scalability and interoperability.

Note that the below list is not exhaustive; this represents the initial list of experiments
to be conducted in JCE with respect to cryptanalytic services. Subsequent
experimentation upon conclusion of the below experiments will be negotiated with
INNOV8 as appropriate.

EXP. 1: Test dataflow (~1 month) This experiment will set up and configure the new
cryptanalytic processing hardware as well as basic dataflows into the cryptanalytic
services for further experimentation. Streaming dataflows of common internet
encryption technologies and ISLANDTRANSPORT dataflows to LONGHAUL for
cryptanalytic recovery will be established. This experiment will ensure that the
cryptanalytic services can properly process data using existing capabilities from NSA-
centric TURMOIL systems. Additionally, the appropriate analytics will be put in place
and evaluated to identify viable candidate input streams (case notations) containing
the common internet encryption technologies of interest.

EXP. 2: Stress testing (~1 month) This experiment will stress test the current suite of
cryptanalytic services to identify the baseline throughput and scalability parameters.

This experiment will leverage and validate candidate input streams (case notations)
containing the common internet encryption technologies of interest.

EXP. 3: Integration of new cryptanalytic processing functionality (4-6 months)
This experiment will introduce new and enhanced capabilities to increase throughput,
scalability and interoperability. This will include but not be limited to hardware
accelerated decryption, agile management of buffered encrypted data, the
development of an interoperable API for sharing CA services requests across
NSA/CES and GCHQ/PTD key recovery architectures, the ability for follow-on
processing architectures to consume large volumes exploited common internet
encryption technologies of interest.

PUT Involvement

Team members include:
o NSA

■	CES

Migration Approach

The goal is to transition new cryptanalytic capabilities as they are tested and validated
in the JCE environment into the JPC operational environment to provide mission
value.

Hardware Requirements

The cryptanalytic services experiment requires the inclusion of 4 IBM 3650 M3
servers (2 servers per 10G LPT) to run the sensitive cryptanalytic mission
applications. The cryptanalytic processing servers are dedicated to cryptanalytic
processing and are firewalled off from the rest of the LPT system. These are an
extension of the NSA/CES cryptanalytic enclave and can only be administered by
CES approved sys-admins. This will include appropriately cleared GCHQ/PTD for
monitoring and auditing purposes. The individuals will need to have a minimum of ECI
PIQARESQUE. The results of cryptanalytic processing will be TS//SI/REL FVEY for
the purposes of this experiment.

Software Requirements

Owner should detail here any additional software requirements and the steps taken to procure the
required items. Note: All software should be registered with SAM.

Connectivity (Dataflows)

The success of the cryptanalytic services experiment relies on the ability to extract
and pass crypto-synch parameters associated with common internet encryption
technologies to NSAW/LONGHAUL for cryptanalytic attack and recovery. The crypto-
synch parameters are extracted in the cryptanalytic processing servers and passed to
NSAW/LONGHAUL via a corporate messaging system (ISLANDTRANSPORT)
connection. The messages are encrypted prior to leaving the cryptanalytic processing
servers using the secure corporate messaging software (ISLANDHIDEAWAY) for
security and authentication.
