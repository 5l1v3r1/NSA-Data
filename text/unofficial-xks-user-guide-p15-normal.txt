Document Metadata

Document Metadata query allows you to search on document authors, organization,
encryption*, and many other things about a document. This is extremely helpful if you
have found a file attachment from a target (e.g. Brick-and-mortar targets, person, or
Organization) and you want to see all of the other files they have sent. With the
Document Metadata query you don’t have to know the email address of the person
sending the document, you just have to know the document’s properties.

“Most Microsoft Office allows uses to encrypt files by clicking Tools -> Options ■> Security and password
protecting the files. The Document Metadata query looks for that type of encryption. It doesn’t look for
PGP or oilier 3"1 party encryption.

“How do I find a document's properties?”

The easiest way to see this is to open a MS Office document and click on File •>
Properties. To find the document properties for a file you target sent, the easiest way is to
view the file in Agility and click on Properties.

Finding your target’s file properties

If you can view the target’s document in Agility, click on the Properties tab to show the
target’s Organization and/or Author. If the fields are unique or random enough you can
query on the term itself. If the Organization or Author aren’t enough to comply with
USSID-18, then you must AND that query with supporting information (IP or Country).
