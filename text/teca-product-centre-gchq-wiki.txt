Objectives

The Technical Enabling Covert Access Product Centre (TECA) is a
product centre within TEA that develops a range of specialist
technologies designed to bridge the gaps to communications that our
conventional accesses cannot reach. We work very closely with SIS
on technical operations for GCHQ requirements, providing technical
solutions and, in most cases, the staff with the skills to deploy and
operate such equipment covertly in the field.

The Product Centre delivers primarily to MTI/aCNO requirements but
also supports certain SSMO and PCS activities. TECA divides its

Whilst TECA manages a portfolio of products, it does not offer them
directly for customer use - the delivery of our specialist requirements
usually requires a combination of sensitive deployments, hardware
and/or software as well as data management services. TECA
provides a bespoke mangaged service that combines all necessary
elements to deliver the required access to the customer.
