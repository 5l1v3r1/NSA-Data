DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) CRD Launches 'CRD Forward' Initiative with Roadshow to<br>Germany and the UK<br>FROM: Sandy Stanar-Johnson<br>Deputy Chief, Customer Gateway (S11)<br>Run Date: 03/23/2004<br>FROM: Sandy Stanar-Johnson <br>Deputy Chief, Customer Gateway (S11) <br>(U//FOUO) From 7 to 13 February 2004, members of the Customer Relationships Directorate<br>leadership team took the CRD message on the road to the<br>US European Command (USEUCOM) and NSA/CSS Europe (NCEUR) at Stuttgart,<br>the European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden,<br>the Joint Analysis Center (JAC) at Molesworth, and the<br>Special U.S. Liaison Office London (SUSLOL) with a video teleconference (VTC) to<br>SUSLOL-Cheltenham.<br>Mr. Carl L. Johnson, Assistant Deputy Director for CRD, led the group.<br>(S//SI) The focus of the trip was to clearly define CRD missions and programs for NSA field<br>personnel who are performing "CRD Forward" functions. CRD pledged to collaborate better with<br>field activities by jointly establishing processes, setting standards and better linking the field to<br>CRD.<br>(S//SI) CRD's assessment of these visits should come as no surprise to anyone - SIGINT<br>continues to be critical to our customers. We (NSA) are hitting the mark, but there is much<br>improvement to be made by engaging the extended enterprise workforce and in developing<br>creative ways to engage and understand our customers.<br>(S//SI) Both USEUCOM, as a customer, and NCEUR, as CRD's functional forward element,<br>welcomed this message. An on-site explanation of how NSA Headquarters is executing<br>Transformation 2.0 proved to be very beneficial to the audience. This trip helped to make real<br>the philosophies of "SIGINT as a team sport" and "swimming upstream."<br>(S//SI) Major focus areas for CRD briefings included:<br>the Customer Engagement Strategy (including soliciting support for reinvigorating<br>Customer Support Plans),<br>Database Access processes,<br>Transformation 2.0 and Dissemination Initiatives, and<br>Support to Military Customers and organizations.<br>Based on initial feedback from NSA personnel, the CRD message was much appreciated and well<br>received.<br>(S//SI) At Stuttgart, Mr. William Crumm, Chief NCEUR , and 40 people from his staff attended<br>the CRD briefings and discussions. His focus was on forward production, information sharing,<br>database access, and soliciting more customer feedback. He also suggested that it would be<br>helpful for DA (S3) to provide more information on new capabilities to those interfacing with the<br>customer because knowledge of these capabilities would further refine EUCOM's Information<br>Need requests. Mr. Crumm expressed his approval of "CRD rolling the message beyond the<br>fence line to the worldwide enterprise."<br>(S//SI) Although the CRD team's focus was on updating NSA personnel, the team also took the<br>opportunity to engage the USEUCOM customers, who were eager to listen and respond to the<br>CRD message. LTG Sylvester, USA, USEUCOM Chief of Staff, applauded the effort, reinforced the<br>need to communicate regularly, and concluded by declaring he had "zero complaints." He did<br>ask that NSA "look hard at our intelligence priorities and requirements, and focus as you can."<br><br> </p>Similarly, RADM Tallent, USN, USEUCOM Director of Operations, declared, "Without SIGINT,<br>we'd be in the dark." All spoke very highly of the network of relationships used to focus SIGINT.<br>They lauded the on-site services performed by NCEUR as well as the continued good relationship<br>with DDAP (S2).<br>(S//SI) At ETC , Mr. Kevin Ford and his leadership team provided their organizational backdrop,<br>and the CRD team focused on key issues for the ETC, Database Access and Partner Relationship<br>Management (PRM). The ETC would benefit from Partner Profiles that would show the big picture<br>relationship with that particular partner and would link ongoing activities at NSAW with mission<br>being performed in the field. The ETC asked the CRD team to explore the S3 connection to<br>CRM/PRM in order to develop business processes that link collection capabilities to customer<br>outcomes.<br>(S//SI) At JAC Molesworth , the CRD team focused on those who are performing CSG-like<br>functions as well as forward-deployed analysis. Those working in support of watch operations<br>made the most of the information CRD presented on changes to exercise support and changes in<br>CSG missions by preparing to change their own job descriptions.<br>(S//SI) In London, Mr. Chris Inglis, SUSLOL , hosted the CRD group for discussion with his staff<br>and then attended a VTC with SUSLOL-Cheltenham to deliver the CRD message. After hearing<br>the presentations and discussions, he declared that he "likes the vector CRD is taking. Clients<br>should go to CRD first and should not have to go anywhere else!" He particularly applauded the<br>Customer Response approach to Information Sharing through identifying the Five Threads to<br>pull through the process with a "just do this" attitude.<br>(U//FOUO) CRD is now discussing follow-on actions to this very fruitful first tour in order to<br>improve our CRD Forward program message before making the next major field visit.
