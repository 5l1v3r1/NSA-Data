What is it?<br>The National SIGINT Committee, or SIGCOM .<br>(U) What does the SIGCOM do exactly? Its overall purpose is to advise and assist the Director of<br>Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Director of NSA (DIRNSA) on a wide range of SIGINT matters.<br>One of the most notable responsibilities of the committee is to provide an independent forum for<br>those with SIGINT equities to meet and exchange information, to discuss policy and other<br>issues, to build consensus, and to provide well-reasoned recommendations to the DIRNSA and<br>the DCI. The committee also:<br>conducts independent assessments and evaluations;<br>provides guidance on national priorities;<br>formulates policy recommendations on foreign affairs, security, and other matters; and<br>serves as an advocate for SIGINT in other IC venues.<br>(U) The DCI established the SIGCOM in 1962. Recognizing the vital role of SIGINT in preserving<br>the nation's security, the DCI selected a former DIRNSA (1956-1960), retired Lieutenant<br>General John A. Samford (USAF), to serve as the SIGCOM's first chairman. Today, the SIGCOM<br>is part of a Community organization that operates with NSA support under the organizational<br>designator D4. The Chairman (currently William P. Marshall) is appointed by DIRNSA in<br>consultation with the Assistant DCI for Collection, and reports to the DIRNSA and the DCI's<br>senior leaders. The SIGCOM's permanent membership includes representatives from each IC<br>organization**, including NSA (Dr. Leonard T. Reinsfelder, CRD Chief of Staff). A 15th member,<br>the Department of Homeland Security, will be joining the SIGCOM soon.<br>(U) The SIGCOM maintains close ties to many other IC organizations, such as the Office of the<br>Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, Community Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)<br>Management Office, Unified Cryptologic Architecture Office, to name just a few. The SIGCOM<br>also includes a small interagency staff that supports the activities of the committee and its<br>subcommittees.<br>(U) The SIGCOM has three subcommittees that carry out specific responsibilities:<br>SIGINT Requirements Validation and Evaluation Subcommittee (SIRVES): validates and<br>prioritizes all SIGINT Information Need statements submitted by customers, evaluates the<br>performance of the U.S. SIGINT System in addressing those needs, and collaborates with NSA in<br>the management of the National SIGINT Requirements Process.<br>SIGINT Overhead Reconnaissance Subcommittee (SORS): develops mission guidance for<br>SIGINT satellite collection systems, conducts independent assessments and evaluations related<br>to collection systems, and provides advice and support on a wide range of operational, system<br>acquisition, policy, programmatic, and other matters. Additionally, SORS has begun to address<br>other forms of SIGINT collection in response to direction from the DCI and DIRNSA.<br>National Emitter Weapons &amp; Space Subcommittee (NEWSS): provides a forum on SIGINT<br>matters for the weapons &amp; space intelligence community, serves as an advocate for the<br>technical SIGINT disciplines of ELINT, Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence, and<br>PROFORMA, conducts independent assessments and evaluations associated with weapons &amp;<br><br> </p>space-related SIGINT, and produces the National Weapons and Space SIGINT Priority List .<br>(U) For further information about SIGCOM and its subcommittees, please contact:<br> SIGCOM SIGINT Issues Manager, <br>, NSA Alternate SIGCOM Member,<br> SIGCOM Executive Secretary, <br><br>.<br><br>;<br>; or<br><br>**(U) The other IC members are: the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency,<br>National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,<br>U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of State, Department of<br>Energy, Department of Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
