Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., announced Sunday.<br>"The Department of Defense has pretty well settled on locating the communications base at the<br>Yakima range," Sen. Jackson said. The department has a number of problems to resolve,<br>"including a hang up on the funding," said Jackson, a member of the Senate armed services<br>committee.<br>"This has the promise of a long-term operational with a high caliber, well paid staff - it will be a<br>fine addition to our state," Jackson said. The facility could be in operation by 1974 if all the plans<br>are worked out, he predicted.<br>(S//SI) The below letter was received by YRS in 1974, accompanied by a wood carving of the<br>Imperial Parabolic Lion of Judah.

The site sported two huge dishes, one measuring 150 feet, to<br>collect the distant radio transmissions. The Soviets launched very few space probes. As a result,<br>STONEHOUSE's main value turned out to be the collection of Soviet MOLNIYA communications<br>satellites which were first launched about the time STONEHOUSE went into operation.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(S//SI) STONEHOUSE closed in 1975.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
