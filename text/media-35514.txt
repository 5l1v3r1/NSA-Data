Requirements

@Scale

Deploy more widely
- Leverage peering with partner

@Volume

Increased system size: 10G -> 40G -> 100G
Increased target volumes: CORNERKICK ++

@Scale

Need

§ Peer to forward “ ‘missing’ attack-events to LONGHAUL”, to LONGHAUL, so
LONGHAUL can use them to complete single-sided processing.

5 LONGHAUL to reciprocate.

Approach

5 LONGHAUL to become aware of which ‘Events’ are not pairing local to agency
and to request peer to send (copy) of such events to LONGHAUL

§ Minimise bandwidth required to communicate requests

§ Peering is a back-end (KPS <-> LONGHAUL)

§ Peers process independently
