@Scale

Need

Peer to forward ?missing? attack-events to to LONGHAUL, so
LONGHAUL can use them to complete single-sided processing.

LONGHAUL to reciprocate.
Approach

LONGHAUL to become aware of which ?Events? are not pairing local to agency
and to request peer to send (copy) of such events to LONGHAUL

Minimise bandwidth required to communicate requests
Peering is a back-end (KPS LONGHAUL)

Peers process independently
