First, British cryptologists at GCHQ<br>successfully broke encrypted faxes from the vessel's INMARSAT terminal, the "Africa 1". This<br>intercept identified the ship as a smuggler. Next, the ship was geolocated by CANYONDUST and<br>the coordinates were passed to Spanish Customs for interdiction.<br>(S//SI) A total of 5.4 tons of cocaine with a United Kingdom street value of 378 million pounds<br>(~$ 689M USD) was seized. Four Greek and one Italian crew members were arrested, and three<br>additional arrests were made in Greece. Operations continue to locate the principal Greek<br>target, to identify additional vessels associated with the organization, and to identify links with<br>South America.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, contact <br><br> at <br><br>@nsa, <br><br>.<br><br>(U//FOUO) See a previous SIDtoday article CANYONDUST Goes Global .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
