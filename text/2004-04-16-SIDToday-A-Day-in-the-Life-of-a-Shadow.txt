DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) A Day in the Life of a Shadow<br>FROM:<br>SIGINT Policy System Manager (S02L1)<br>Run Date: 04/16/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>SIGINT Policy System Manager (S02L1) <br>(U//FOUO) On February 5, 2004, I had the opportunity to "shadow" MG Quirk. I was a bit<br>apprehensive, but MG Quirk quickly put my mind at ease and made me feel like part of the<br>team. Our day started at 0700 with a meeting with the U.S. Army members of the Junior Officer<br>Cryptologic Career Program. MG Quirk had many meetings throughout the day, and some<br>meetings sparked actions and the scheduling of other meetings that had to be squeezed in<br>throughout the day. The meetings varied from personnel meetings to an IWS (InfoWorkSpace)<br>with the Second Party Partners, with just about every topic related to SID in between.<br>(U//FOUO) As I observed MG Quirk's interactions, I was very proud be part of the SID and<br>serving under MG Quirk as the SIGINT Director. Even though every minute of his day was<br>spoken for, he made time to have personal and professional discussions with me. He shared<br>information on what skills and abilities I would need to succeed as a manager in the SID and<br>NSA. He treated everyone with great respect and consideration which made everyone feel<br>welcome and very comfortable in his office. We ended our day at 1900 -- yes 12 hours!<br>(U//FOUO) I learned a great deal on how to work with people of all levels and skills and this was<br>a great experience for someone with only a year in a management position. However, anyone<br>who wants a deeper insight into the SID or management in general should really take advantage<br>of this great program. MG Quirk's advice to me can be summarized with this statement: "My job<br>is to add value." This was very insightful and thought provoking and I hope that as I hone my<br>skills and abilities and work in management that I do add value to the job, SID, and NSA. To top<br>off the day, MG Quirk presented me with a SID Coin, providing me a lasting token to<br>commemorate my day as a "Shadow".<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
