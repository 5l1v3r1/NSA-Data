Here's one:<br>(TS//SI) My wife, daughter and I arrived in Moscow on a Friday<br>morning in August to start our first SCS tour. We were thrilled -we were about to spend two years in a place none of us ever<br>thought that we would ever even see. Under the tutelage of our<br>sponsor, Saturday and Sunday were filled with sightseeing and<br>learning how to get around the city. We went to bed Sunday night<br>worn out from miles of walking and exploring.<br>(TS//SI) Early Monday morning we awoke at sunrise to the sound<br>of heavy equipment outside of our bedroom window. We crawled<br>out of bed to peek around the drapes and found a column of tanks<br>rolling along the street outside. This certainly seemed strange, but<br>didn't cause us a lot of concern. I had never heard of the Red Army<br>conducting an exercise in the city, but that didn't mean it couldn't<br>happen. We had breakfast and went out onto the embassy<br>compound to meet my new boss and start in-processing.<br>(TS//SI) The first person to walk by hollered, "There's been a coup,<br>Gorbachev is missing." My boss came running up the street and all<br>thoughts of in-processing were forgotten. We left our families and<br>hurried to the site where we spent the next 24 hours trying to sort<br>out the communications environment and figure out what was<br>going on. Eventually we organized site personnel into two teams,<br>each working 12-hour shifts. We spent the next week monitoring<br>the activities that eventually led to Gorbachev's fall and Yeltsin's<br>rise to power.<br>(U) Since I was working the night shift, I was home during the day<br>and was able to watch and hear Yeltsin, from our bedroom window,<br>addressing the crowds outside of the battle scarred Russian White<br>House while standing on top of a tank.<br>(U) This was our welcome to the SCS world and the beginning of<br>eleven years overseas peppered with moments of surprise, fear,<br>sadness, and regret but always filled with a sense of<br>accomplishment.<br>Look for more from <br><br> soon.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.
