I have been offered the job of Chief Technology Officer at the FBI, and it is an<br>opportunity I just could not pass up. In 25 years, one develops an enormous number of solid<br>friends and professional acquaintances, and my hope is that these relationships will endure<br>beyond this transition.<br>(S//SI) As many of you know, my passion as Technical Director for Analysis &amp; Production for the<br>past 3 and a half years has been to build the stature of that position to positively influence the<br>corporation. Many often think that technical folks, subject matter experts, TDs, TLs or whatever<br>the appellation of the day is, do not have much authority or control. But I want to testify that<br>serving in all of those roles at one time or another in my career at NSA, you have more authority<br>and control than you think.<br>(S//SI) I've tested boundaries that I thought were there, and each time found out they were<br>only in my mind. I've been enabled to conquer significant language and analytic problems early<br>in my career, have a major impact on a critical new collection capability mid-career, and play a<br>key role in driving corporate solutions to problems late in my career. This isn't a checklist about<br>me, but a testament to the impact technical leaders can have anywhere when they put their<br>minds to it.<br>(C//SI) As I leave NSA, I would challenge you continue to test those "boundaries," and provide<br>leadership on the hard problems facing the agency. Don't shy away from them. If you don't take<br>the lead on solving information overload problems, complex analytic and language tasks, or<br>something like exploiting the Internet, nobody else will. Step into these hard challenges and fill<br>the gap. I'll be watching from a distance and rooting for your success.<br>God Bless,<br>Jack Israel<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
