In the latter case. the extracted ccntent fragments are stcred in the metadata table 30 days.

If ycu are gcing tc use search criteria that will extract data abcut pecple and stcre that in the

and sccpe cf any data being red in case it includes at least the names cf indiyid uals and the
majcrity cf the data is net believed tc relate in prcbable intelligence targets- This wculd make
this data particularly sensitive-

 

 

In additicn. a quarterly check is new being made cn all new which add data tc the

metadata table te ensure they meet UK legal and pelicy requirements-

Please alse be aware that usually are autematically shared with atleast NSA and
may alse get depleyed in ether 2P I-IKS- By mid-2011 a new versien ef I-IKS sheuld have been
depleyed where individual will still be depleyed in every KKS- but they can be
tagged net te run en certain I-IKS- The enly exceptien is where yeu depley a micreplugin enly te
GTE's I-IKS ?eet: these will net be visible te 2P partners.

[edit] Types. nf 

There are currently three different types ef I-IKS:

- deitiena]
I Stage 2
a Deep Dive

They differ principally en where in the precessing chain they sit whether the data they receive
has already been sessienised er net and whether they ingest all ef the data they receive er
whether they apply rules te enly ingest seme data.

[edit] "firaditienal

1ill-rhen I-IKS was ?rst develeped it was used te receive data frem lew data rate signals being
precessed threugh WC sessienised all the data en the link and
presented it all te I-IKS- data was ingested inte I-IKS-

GCHQ has traditienal I-IKS at many ef eur sites- including all ef eur Cemsat. Terrestrial and SMD
sites. The ?163 is alse a traditienal KKS- theugh in that case data has been sefily selected
at the implant and sessienisatien takes place in TEE-RAIN. rather than WC-

Stage 3

Fer higher data rates. a ?Stage 2" ?163 was develeped te ingest data frem TURMDIL- 
passes 5% cf the packets te I-IKS which I-IKS then sessienises. decides which 5% cf
packets te pass based en the fellewing criteria:

streng selectien

subnet premetien

technelegy premetien

e-mail demains

persena sessien premetien [where if a streng selecter is seen- IEII minutes? er MB ef data
is cellected}

I persena sessien eellectien [where the data is cellected and ferwarded te PINWALE
but is alse passed te the 

This data is then sent in the Stage 2 I-IKS- ether data is lest-

at GCHQ uses a Stage 2 XKS-
[edit] Deep Dive

Deep Dive was develeped te preve that sessienisatien at IBIS data rates was pessible. First it
sessienises all data en a link- Then it premetes data using the GENESIS selectien language te
identify data types where we assess there is petential intelligence value and ingests these. The
premetien precess can make ene ef three decisiens:

I Sleek data that is legally net allewed in be in the system ie traf?c
I data that is knewn te he wanted threugh use ef premetien rules
I And then te drep any data that deesn't meet either ef these

?ne ef the experiments in TINT is seeking te identify where the best balance lies between what
is kept and what is net. facterin deciding hew much data te keep is the scale ef sterage
capacity that can be previded-

GCHQ already eperates a number ef Deep Dive I-IKS:
