COTTONMOUTH-III

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL) COTTONMOUTH-I (CM-I) is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) hardware implant,
which will provide a wireless bridge into a target network as well as the ability to load exploit
software onto target PCs.

(TS//SI//REL) CM-III will provide air-gap bridging, software persistence capability, “in-field"
re-programmability, and covert communications with a host software implant over the USB.
The RF link will enable command and data infiltration and exfiltration. CM-III will also
communicate with Data Network Technologies (DNT) software (STRAITBIZARRE) through a
covert channel implemented on the USB, using this communication channel to pass
commands and data between hardware and software implants. CM-III will be a GENIE-
compliant implant based on CHIMNEYPOOL.

(TS//SI//REL) CM-III conceals digital components (TRINITY), a USB 2.0 HS hub. switches,
and HOWLERMONKEY (HM) RF Transceiver within a RJ45 Dual Stacked USB connector.
CM-I has the ability to communicate to other CM devices over the RF link using an over-the-
air protocol called SPECULATION. CM-III can provide a short range inter-chassis link to
other CM devices or an intra-chassis RF link to a long haul relay subsystem.
