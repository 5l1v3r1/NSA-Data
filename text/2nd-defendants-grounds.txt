SECOND DEFENDANT’S DETAILED GROUNDS FOR
RESISTING THE CLAIM

Introduction and summary

1.	On Sunday 18 August 2013, at 0805, Mr David Miranda was stopped by officers of the
Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) whilst in the international transit area of Heathrow
Airport. He was detained for the purposes of questioning, and certain items of his
property were seized and retained, under powers conferred by Schedule 7 to the
Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT). He was offered food, water and legal representation and
then released after nine hours. The VIPS bought an airline ticket to enable him to
continue his journey to Rio de Janeiro.

2.	By this claim, Mr Miranda challenges the legality of his detention and of the
seizure and retention of his property on three grounds. The MPS submits that the
detention and the seizure and retention of property were proportionate and lawful

and that this claim should therefore be dismissed. As to the three grounds of

challenge:

2.1.	Ground 1 (The use of Schedule 7 powers): The MPS believed, on the basis
of intelligence, that Mr Miranda might be connected to a conspiracy between
Edward Snowden and others to disclose highly sensitive material unlawfully
obtained from US and UK intelligence agencies. The MPS considered that
past or future disclosures by Edward Snowden and/or his associates might
constitute acts of terrorism as defined by s. 1 of TACT because these
disclosures: (a) might endanger lives or be designed seriously to interfere
with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system; (b) might be designed to
influence the Government of the United Kingdom; and (c) might have been
made for the purpose of advancing a political or ideological cause. Because
they did not know whether Mr Miranda had any role in these disclosures, or if
so what role, the MPS decided that it could not arrest him on suspicion of an
offence. Instead, it decided to stop, question and detain him for the purpose
specified in para. 2(1) of Sch. 7 to TACT, namely, to determine whether he
appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission,
preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, as defined, in doing so, the
MPS acted proportionately and lawfully.

2.2.	Ground 2' (Transit passengers): Schedule 7 on its face applied to Mr
Miranda because (a) he was at a port (Heathrow Airport) and (b) his presence
there was connected with his entering the United Kingdom, albeit only en
route to somewhere else (Rio de Janeiro). There is nothing to indicate that the
special meaning of “entering’ that applies in the immigration context (ie
passing through immigration control) applies here. Mr Miranda’s
construction would lead to the anomalous position that Schedule 7 would
apply to persons travelling by air internally (who are not intending to cross
any border) and also to persons on ships or aircraft (even if they are in
transit), but not to persons such as Mr Miranda who are in the international
transit area of the airport. Such a construction would make little sense and
should be rejected.

2.3.	Ground 3 (Convention compatibility): The powers of detention conferred
by Schedule 7 to TACT are compatible with Articles 5, 6 and 8 ECHR for the
reasons given by the Divisional Court in Beghal v Director of Public



Prosecutions [2013] EWHC 2573 (Admin). The exercise of powers in this
case did not engage either Article 10 ECHR or the protections accorded to
journalistic material under Schedule 5 to TACT because (a) the MPS did not
know or believe that Mr Miranda had acquired the material for the purposes
of journalism; and (b) Mr Miranda did not when questioned claim to be a
journalist or to be carrying the material on behalf of anyone else who was a
journalist or to have acquired the material for the purposes of journalism.

The law

The power to question

3.	Section 53 TACT gives effect to Schedule 7.

4.	Para. 2 of Schedule 7 confers power on "an examining officer" to question a person
"for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person falling within
section 40( I Xb)'T see para. 2(1). By para. 2(2), it applies to a person if:

"(a) he is at a port or in the border area; and

(b)	the examining officer believes that the person's presence at the port
or in the area is connected with his entering or leaving Great Britain or
Northern Ireland or his travelling by air within Great Britain or within
Northern Ireland."

By para. 2(3), the power to question also applies to a person "on a ship or aircraft
which has arrived at any place in Great Britain or Northern Ireland (whether form
within Great Britain or Northern Ireland)". By para. 2(4), an examining officer may
exercise his powers under para. 2 "whether or not he has grounds tor suspecting
that a person falls within section 40(l)(b)'\

5.	Section 40(1 )(b) covers a person who "is, or has been, concerned in the
commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism".

6.	Terrorism is defined by s. 1 as follows:

"(1) In this Act terrorism' means the use or threat of action where —

(a)	the action falls within subsection (2),

3

(b)	the use or threat is designed to influence the government [or an
international governmental organisation] or to intimidate the
public or a section of the public, and

(c)	the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political,
religious, racial or ideological cause.

(2) Action falls within this subsection if it—

(a)	involves serious violence against a person,

(b)	involves serious damage to property,

(c)	endangers a person's life, other than that of the person
committing the action,

(d)	creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a
section of the public,

(e)	is designed to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic
system.

The powers to detain and search persons and detain things

7.	Para. 6(1) of Schedule 7 confers on an examining officer the power (a) to stop a
person and (b) to detain a person "for the purpose of exercising a power under
paragraph 2 ', but, only for a maximum period of nine hours.

8.	Para. 8 confers on an examining officer powers of search in relation to a person
questioned under para. 2. The power may be exercised "for the purpose of
determining whether he falls within section 40(l)(b)v.

9.	Para. 11 confers on the examining officer power to detain for 7 days anything given
to the examining officer or seized during questioning.

The obligations of the person examined

10.	Para. 5 imposes upon a person questioned under para. 2 the obligations, inter alia,
(a) to give the examining officer any information in his possession which the
officer requests and (d) to give the examining officer on request any document
which he has with him and which is of a kind specified by the officer.

11.	Para. 18 makes it an offence wilfully to fail to comply with a duty imposed under or
by virtue of Sch. 7 or wilfully to obstruct or seek to frustrate a search or
examination under or by virtue of Sch. 7.

The Code of Practice

12.	Under powers conferred by para. 6(1) of Sch. 14 to TACT, the Home Office has
issued a Code of Practice (the Code) for examining officers.

13.	At paras 9 and 10, the Code provides:

"9. The purpose of questioning and associated powers to determine
whether a person appears to be someone who is or has been concerned
in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The
powers, which are additional to the powers of arrest under the Act,
should not be used for any other purpose.

10. An examining officer may question a person whether or not he
suspects that the person is or has been concerned in the commission,
preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism and may stop that
person for the purposes of determining whether this appears to be the
case. Examining officers should therefore make every reasonable effort
to exercise the powers in such a way as to minimise causing
embarrassment or offence to a person who is being questioned.”

14.	The accompanying Notes for guidance underline that the powers must be used
' proportionately, reasonably, with respect and without unlawful discrimination”.
They go on to say that “[examining officers must take particular care to ensure that
the selection of persons for examination is not solely based on their perceived
ethnic background or religion.” The powers are not to be exercised so as to
‘ unfairly discriminate” against anyone on the grounds, inter alia, of race, colour,
religion or creed.

Case law interpreting Schedule 7

15.	Sch. 7 was considered by Collins J in CC v Commissioner of Police for the
Metropolis [2011] EWHC 3316 (Admin), [2012] 1 WLR 1913. Collins J made
these observations about the circumstances in which the power may be used:

T4... in fact, as must be obvious, the existence of prior information is
likely in many eases to mean that an examination will be considered

necessary. But the officers are able to act on an intuitive basis even if
no prior information exists.

15.	The wording of section 40(1 )(b) is important. It in my judgment
recognises that it must be open to an officer to act under Schedule 7 to
determine whether a person appears to be or to have been concerned
and to identify any acts constituting that concern. Thus, even if it
appears that he has in the past been concerned in any such acts, it is
open to the officer to examine him to determine whether he is still so
concerned. Equally, it may be apparent that he is concerned in acts
against a foreign government, but it must be open to officers to examine
him to determine whether his acts affect this country or, indeed, any
country other than that affected by his known acts...

16.	it in my view goes further than those obvious requirements which
are essential to fulfil the purpose of the Schedule 7 powers, namely the
protection of the inhabitants of this (or indeed any other) country from
acts of terrorism. If officers are informed by the Security Service or
from any other source that a person, who appears to be a terrorist, is
suspected of possible involvement with others in a specific terrorist
plot,, they may examine him for the purpose of determining whether he
appears to be so involved. This is because the language of section
40(1 )(b) is wide enough to allow for examination not only of whether
he appears to be a terrorist but also of the way in which or the act by
which he so appears. The officer is not, unless the powers are to be
ineffective in their purpose to protect from terrorism, prevented from
examining a person even if it appears he is a terrorist in particular
respects, for example if in the past or by acts only affecting a foreign
government/"

16. At [17]-[18], Collins J rejected the submission that an examination must come to an
end once the examining officer determines that the person being examined is, or is
not, a terrorist:

'17... First, the determination is not necessarily one for the examining
officer. For example, searches may have taken place or samples taken
and examination of anything obtained may show that an apparent
concern in the relevant acts was not correct. It may therefore be
important that all relevant information is obtained. Secondly, the
apparent concern may be of past or particular acts amounting to
terrorism and it may be important to see how far such concern goes.
Thirdly, there may be a stage at which the officer is persuaded that the
person concerned is a terrorist but further examination may dispel that
view. It must be for the officer to judge when the examination should
come to an end. No doubt his conclusion will then be forwarded to his
superiors and the Security Service to see whether surveillance is

6

required or there is sufficient to arrest under section 41 , The officer
himself has the power of arrest under section 41 , but I would suppose
that he would not save in the clearest case exercise that power, it might
be necessary if the officer were satisfied that the person concerned was
a danger and needed to be kept in custody, but that could sometimes be
addressed by informing the Home Office who could then impose
immigration or other controls.

18... There may come a point when the officer does consider that the
examinee does not appear to be a terrorist, but his conclusion may not
be shared by others and may, when what has emerged from the
examination or any search is put together with other material which
may, for example, be in the possession of the Security Service be
shown to be wrong. Equally, further examination may show that the
officer's view formed at a particular point was wrong. Again, in my
view he must be able to ask all questions that he reasonably believes to
be needed to enable him or others to reach the necessary
determination.1'

17.	At [18], Collins J rejected a submission that the power to search was confined more
narrowly than the power to question. At [20], he made plain that the existence of a
power to arrest does not imply a duty to do so, nor does it imply that the Sch. 7
power is unavailable.

18.	On the facts, Collins J concluded at [34] that the powers conferred by Sch. 7 had
been exercised for a purpose which ;had nothing to do with determining whether
[the claimant] was a terrorist in any particular way A At [35], he said this:

"I have no doubt that this is a very rare case and that this decision will
not damage the efficacy of the powers. They are properly given a wide
construction for the reasons 1 have set out but cannot extend to the facts
of this case. ’1

19.	More recently, in Beghal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] EWHC 2573
(Admin) the Divisional Court (Gross LJ, Swift & Foskett JJ) considered and
dismissed a wide-ranging human rights challenge to the powers conferred by Sch.
7. The legislative history is set out at [35]-[52]. The views of successive
Independent Reviewers of Terrorism Legislation (Lord Carlile of Berriew QC and
David Anderson QC) are noted at [53]-[67]. As to the compatibility of the Sch. 7
powers with Article 8 ECHR, the Court distinguished the power considered by the
House of Lords in R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2006]
IJKHL; [2006] 2 AC 307 and Gillan v United Kingdom (2010) 50 EHRR 1105. At

7

[90]	, Gross LJ (giving the judgment of the Court) referred to the Code as affording
;'a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the Executive". At

[91]	, he added;

"In our judgment port and border control is very different from a power
to stop and search, potentially exercisable anywhere in the jurisdiction.
Conclusions as to the arbitrariness of the latter do not readily, still less
necessarily, translate into conclusions as to the former. As Schedule 7,
para. 2 {supra) makes clear, the relevant powers apply only to a limited
category of people — namely those 'at a port or in the border area’,
where 'the examining officer believes that the person’s presence... is
connected with his entering or leaving...’ the country and also to a
person on a ship or aircraft which has arrived at any place in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. That the category of persons to whom
Schedule 7 powers are applicable may itself be numerically large is
neither here nor there; port and border controls cannot be simplistieally
assimilated with generalised powers of stop and search exercisable
anywhere in any circumstances."

20.	At [94], Gross LJ again stressed the importance of port and border controls. At
[95], he noted that the powers were "applicable only to a limited category of
people, as explained earlier: namely, travellers in confined geographical areas"; and
noted that the statistics bore out the proportionate use of the powers. At [96]
reliance was placed on the limited purpose for which the powers could be
exercised. At [97], Gross LJ noted that:

"...the Schedule 7 powers, though principally exercised by police
officers, are an aspect of port and border control rather than of a
criminal investigation. Viewed in this context, it is perhaps unsurprising
that there is no requirement of reasonable suspicion for the powers to be
exercised (as made clear by Schedule 7, para. 2(4) ). At all events,
having regard to the context, the absence of a requirement of reasonable
suspicion does not lend any or significant support to the Appellant's
case that these powers are exercised arbitrarily. Realistically, in the
present context, the requirement of reasonable suspicion would deter
the proper exercise of Schedule 7 powers and render them all too easy
to evade, so increasing the risk to the public."

At [98], Gross LJ drew attention to the importance of the purpose served by Sch. 7,
namely, protecting the public from terrorism, having regard to its international
character.

8

21.	At [112], Gross LJ concluded that the Sch. 7 powers strike "a fair balance...
between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community'' and that
the Article 8 challenge therefore failed. At [113], he held that the conclusions
reached in relation to Article 8 were also applicable to the Article 5 claim, which
therefore also failed.

22.	So far as Article 6 is concerned, Gross LJ held at [129] that:

' Overall, as a matter of reality, the examination of the Appellant under
Schedule 7 was not an inquiry preparatory to criminal proceedings. This
examination was in no sense part of the scheme under PACE. It was
instead an inquiry relating to border control with the specific public
interest of safeguarding society from the risk of terrorism. The purpose
of the exercise of these Schedule 7 powers of examination is separate
and distinct from that relating to the instigation of criminal
proceedings.''

For that reason, the conclusion was drawn at [133] that the examination under Sch.
7 did not engage the Claimant's rights under Article 6. Even if it had been, s. 78 of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), which enables a criminal court to
exclude evidence, provided a sufficient safeguard preventing the unfair use of
material obtained pursuant to Sch. 7; so that even if Article 6 had been engaged, it
would not have been violated: see at [143].

The facts of this case

23.	The background to the use of the Sch. 7 powers in this case is set out in detail in the
witness statements of Acting Detective Inspector "A" and Detective Superintendent

J	"B". It is not repeated here. However, the essence can be stated as follows.

24.	Mr Miranda was stopped as a result of a joint Security Service/MPS operation.

25.	DSupt "B ' received information from the Security Service that Mr Snowden had
highly sensitive information stolen from the UK intelligence community. Mr
Snowden and his associates had begun and were continuing to disseminate this
information. It was known that Glenn Greenwald, a freelance journalist working for
The Guardian, together with an individual in Berlin (Ms Poitras), were involved.
Mr Miranda was Mr Greenwald's husband and he would be travelling from Berlin

9

to Rio de Janeiro through Heathrow. It was thought possible that Mr Miranda
could be carrying at least some of the stolen classified material.

26.	If so, the Security Service wanted to obtain the material in order to gain an insight
into what UK classified material, if any, it was thought that Mr Miranda might be
carrying; to deny the use of that material; and to increase their intelligence coverage
in order to protect UK national security.

27.	The MPS, however, considered separately what powers they could and should
exercise. Consideration was given to arresting Mr Miranda, but the decision was
taken that there was not enough information to justify an arrest. DSupt TU
understood that Mr Snowden had been allowed to stay in Russia for a year. He
considered it possible that Mr Snowden might have passed material to a third party
State or to non State actors. He thought it possible that disclosure had been or might
be made by Mr Snowden and/or a third party State or to non State actors that
endangered life, created a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or were
designed seriously to disrupt an electronic system. He considered that such
disclosure might have been made with the intention of influencing the UK
Government; and that they may have been made for the purpose of advancing a
political or ideological cause.

28.	The decision to authorise the stop was taken by Acting Detective Inspector "A’’,
who was responsible for the team at Heathrow Airport. The case for the stop was
communicated directly by the Security Service to him. It was contained in a Ports
Circulation Sheet (PCS), initially, the PCS did not contain enough information to
enable ADI "A” to authorise the stop. However, in its final form, the justification
advanced by the Security Service was accepted. It was in these terms:

'Intelligence indicates that MIRANDA is likely to be involved in
espionage activity which has the potential to act against the interests of
UK national security. We therefore wish to establish the nature of
MIRANDA'S activity, assess the risk that MIRANDA poses to UK
national security and mitigate as appropriate. We are requesting that
you exercise your powers to carry out a ports stop against MIRANDA.

We assess that MIRANDA is knowingly carrying material, the release
of which would endanger people's lives. Additionally the disclosure, or
threat of disclosure, is designed to influence a government, and is made
for the purpose of promoting a political or ideological cause. This

10

therefore falls within the definition of terrorism and as such we request
that the subject is examined under Schedule 7.’’

29.	After he had been stopped, Mr Miranda was questioned and a record made of the
questions posed and answers given. He was offered food and water, given the
opportunity to take medication (after consulting a forensic medical examiner) and
attempts (at his request) were made to contact Mr Greenwald. He was offered legal
representation and in due course a representative from Bindmans attended. He was
released after nine hours.

Ground 1: The use of Schedule 7

30.	Mr Miranda alleges that:

30.1.	Sch. 7 "appear[s] to have been exercised... in order to retrieve the material in
his possession which may have originated from Mr Snowden; and/or to
question the Claimant in relation to his involvement in those disclosures'’:
Grounds for Judicial Review, §49; and

30.2.	this was done in order to ^bypass the appropriate statutory regimes for
obtaining confidential journalistic information and circumvented the
important statutory safeguards (including the requirement to obtain a court
order before seizing material) contained in those mechanisms1’: Grounds for
Judicial Review, §52(7). In this context, reference is made to Sch. 5 to TACT,
which contains in paras 5-10 special protections for (inter alia) journalistic
material.



n

31.	As to the first of these points, it is true that the Security Service wanted to retrieve
the material which it was thought that Mr Miranda might be carrying and to prevent
its further dissemination. However, the evidence makes plain that the MPS did not
unthinkingly execute a Security Service plan. Both DSupt ‘TV' and Acting DI "A"
considered separately whether the preconditions for the exercise of the Sch. 7
power were met (the focus must of course be on the decision of the officer at the
Port - Acting DI "A" - that it was proper to exercise Sch. 7 powers in relation to Mr
Miranda). But both he and DSupt "B" concluded that the conditions for the exercise
of the Sch 7 powers were satisfied. They were right to do so because:

31.1.	The purpose for which the Sch. 7 power may be exercised is determining
whether it appears that the person being examined is a person failing within
section 40(1 )(b). To exercise the power, it was not necessary to have a
reasonable suspicion, let alone a concluded view, that Mr Miranda was a
person falling within s.40(l)(b).

31.2.	Section 40(1 )(b) is drafted broadly. It covers those who are or have been
"concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of
terrorism5'. That formulation covers any kind of participation.

31.3.	All the elements of s. 1(1) TACT were satisfied. As to (a), the MPS properly
took the view (on the basis of what it had been told by the Security Service)
that disclosure(s) of the material which it was thought that Mr Miranda might
be carrying might endanger lives and/or create a risk to public safety and,
additionally, might have been designed seriously to interfere with an
electronic system. As to (b), the MPS properly took the view that the
disclosures might have been intended by Mr Snowden to influence the UK
Government. It was known that Mr Snowden had been allowed to stay in
Russia for a year. It was not known what (if anything) he had disclosed, or
agreed to disclose, to a third party State or to non State actors, nor what was
the intention or motivation behind any disclosures. As to (c), the MPS
properly assessed that the disclosures might have been made for the purpose
of advancing a political or ideological cause. In the circumstances, it was
proper to exercise the Sch. 7 powers for the purposes of determining whether
Mr Miranda was a person falling within s. 40(1 )(b).

12

32.	As to the second allegation, the reference to provisions according special protection

for journalistic material are not relevant here because:

32.1.	The powers conferred by Sch. 5 and Sch. 7 deal with different situations. Sch.
5 powers are appropriate to, and apply, only when material is sought for the
purposes of a criminal investigation. Sch. 7 confers powers which apply when
no criminal investigation is on foot. They are conferred for a different
purpose and apply at an earlier stage: see eg Beghal, per Gross LJ at [97] and
[129].

32.2.	In any event, the evidence does not establish that the material was in fact
"journalistic materiar as defined in TACT (by reference to s. 13 of PACE).
Mr Miranda did not and does not claim to be a journalist. He denied that he
was carrying the material for anyone else. Even when his legal representative
attended, no suggestion was made that the material was "journalistic
material” for the purposes of PACE or TACT.

32.3.	insofar as the protections accorded to journalistic material are designed to
protect sources, there is on the current evidence nothing to indicate that the
material revealed any journalistic source that had not already been made
public. Mr Snowden had, of course, decided to reveal his identity. Ms Poitras’
involvement was also in the public domain. Nothing in the material currently
accessed indicates any other source.

32.4.	Finally, even if the material was 'acquired for the purposes of journalism”
within the meaning of s. 13 of PACE, the protections of the special regimes
applicable to such material do not apply where - as in the present case - the
material was stolen or obtained unlawfully: see by analogy Welwyn Hatfield
Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government [2011] UKSC 15 [2011] 2 AC 304.

Ground 2: Transit passengers

33.	Under his second .ground, the Claimant contends that Schedule 7 confers no power
to question or detain transit passengers because a transit passenger's presence at a
port or airport is not "connected with his entering or leaving Great Britain or
Northern Ireland” for the purposes of para. 2(2)(b) of Schedule 7.

13

34.	The basis for this contention is that the phrase ''entering... Great Britain or Northern
Ireland" is to be understood by reference to the ease law on the concept of entering
the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971.

35.	The short answer to the point is that there is nothing in TACT to indicate that the
phrase "entering... Great Britain and Northern Ireland" was intended to have the
same meaning as the equivalent phrase in the Immigration Act 1971. The two Acts
are not in pari materia.

36.	it is easy to see that, in creating immigration offences of illegally entering the
United Kingdom, Parliament would not have wished to catch transit passengers.
That explains the decision of the House of Lords in R v Naillie [1993] 1 AC 674,
680. But the Schedule 7 power is not concerned with immigration. It is applicable
to travellers using ports and airports even when they are travelling internally and to
travellers on board ships or aircraft even when they are simply using a UK port or
airport to transit.

37.	if the Claimant were correct, Schedule 7 would confer power to question and
detain:

37.1.	passengers at ports or airports who have no intention of crossing any borders
because they are travelling internally (see the final words of para. 2(2)(b),
inserted by the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001);

37.2.	passengers who are on ships or aircraft that have arrived in the United
Kingdom from abroad, even if they are in transit to another country and do
not intend to go through passport control (para. 2(3));

but not:

37.3.	transit passengers who have disembarked from their aircraft.

38.	In other words, on this construction, the Police could have detained Mr Miranda
while he was on the aircraft (even though he had only arrived for the purposes of
transit) but not once he left it.

39.	ft is difficult to see why Parliament should have intended such a construction. The
context suggests that para. 2(2)(b) serves an altogether different purpose: ensuring

14

that the Schedule 7 power is not used in respect of persons whose presence at the
port or airport is not connected with travelling at all (eg port or airport staff).

Ground 3: Convention compatibility

40.	As to the alleged breach of Articles 5, 6 and 8 ECHR, the powers conferred by Sch.
7 have been held by the Divisional Court to be lawful and proportionate: see
BeghaL This Court should follow Beg ha l: see R v Greater Manchester Coroner ex
p Tal [1985] QB 67, 79e-81e.

41.	As to the alleged breach of Article 10:

41.1.	tt is unclear whose Article 10 rights are being asserted here. Mr Miranda did
not claim when questioned to be a journalist or to be carrying the material
seized on behalf of any other person. He did not assert (and nor did his
representative) that the material had been acquired for the purposes of
journalism.

41.2.	in any event, the focus of the Strasbourg authorities on Article 10 is the
protection of journalistic sources: see eg Telegraaf Media Nederland
Landelijke Media BV et alv Netherlands, application No.39315/06 (2012) 34
BHRC 193, at [86]; Goodwin v United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 123, at
[39]; Roemen and Schmit v Luxembourg, application No.51772/9, at [47];
Financial Times Ltd et al v United Kingdom, application No.821/03, at [70]-
[71]. There is no evidence that the material seized reveals any journalistic
source who was not already prominently in the public domain,

41.3.	In any event, there is no principle to be derived from the Article 10 case law
that journalistic material cannot be seized by a procedure which does not
involve a judicial decision. In particular, Sanoma v Netherlands, application
38224/03 does not establish any such general principle. It can be
distinguished on its facts because it concerned a seizure in the context of
criminal proceedings and did not concern terrorism.

Conclusion

42.	For the reasons set out above, the court is respectfully invited to dismiss this claim.

15

Post-script: Relief

43.	If, contrary to the Second Defendant’s position outlined above, the Court were to
find that the exercise of Schedule 7 powers in this case was not lawful, then the
Second Defendant would wish to advance further, separate submissions on the
issue of relief having regard, in particular, to the nature of the contents of the
material in issue, and the progress (at that stage) of the investigations which are
being conducted into the material.

THE QUEEN

on the application of
DAVID MIRANDA

-and-

(2)	THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE FOR THE METROPOLIS

Defendants

SECOND DEFENDANT’S DETAILED GROUNDS FOR
RESISTING THE CLAIM

Introduction and summary

1.	On Sunday 18 August 2013, at 0805, Mr David Miranda was stopped by officers of the
Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) whilst in the international transit area of Heathrow
Airport. He was detained for the purposes of questioning, and certain items of his
property were seized and retained, under powers conferred by Schedule 7 to the
Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT). He was offered food, water and legal representation and
then released after nine hours. The VIPS bought an airline ticket to enable him to
continue his journey to Rio de Janeiro.

2.	By this claim, Mr Miranda challenges the legality of his detention and of the
seizure and retention of his property on three grounds. The MPS submits that the
detention and the seizure and retention of property were proportionate and lawful

and that this claim should therefore be dismissed. As to the three grounds of

challenge:

2.1.	Ground 1 (The use of Schedule 7 powers): The MPS believed, on the basis
of intelligence, that Mr Miranda might be connected to a conspiracy between
Edward Snowden and others to disclose highly sensitive material unlawfully
obtained from US and UK intelligence agencies. The MPS considered that
past or future disclosures by Edward Snowden and/or his associates might
constitute acts of terrorism as defined by s. 1 of TACT because these
disclosures: (a) might endanger lives or be designed seriously to interfere
with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system; (b) might be designed to
influence the Government of the United Kingdom; and (c) might have been
made for the purpose of advancing a political or ideological cause. Because
they did not know whether Mr Miranda had any role in these disclosures, or if
so what role, the MPS decided that it could not arrest him on suspicion of an
offence. Instead, it decided to stop, question and detain him for the purpose
specified in para. 2(1) of Sch. 7 to TACT, namely, to determine whether he
appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission,
preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, as defined, in doing so, the
MPS acted proportionately and lawfully.

2.2.	Ground 2' (Transit passengers): Schedule 7 on its face applied to Mr
Miranda because (a) he was at a port (Heathrow Airport) and (b) his presence
there was connected with his entering the United Kingdom, albeit only en
route to somewhere else (Rio de Janeiro). There is nothing to indicate that the
special meaning of “entering’ that applies in the immigration context (ie
passing through immigration control) applies here. Mr Miranda’s
construction would lead to the anomalous position that Schedule 7 would
apply to persons travelling by air internally (who are not intending to cross
any border) and also to persons on ships or aircraft (even if they are in
transit), but not to persons such as Mr Miranda who are in the international
transit area of the airport. Such a construction would make little sense and
should be rejected.

2.3.	Ground 3 (Convention compatibility): The powers of detention conferred
by Schedule 7 to TACT are compatible with Articles 5, 6 and 8 ECHR for the
reasons given by the Divisional Court in Beghal v Director of Public



Prosecutions [2013] EWHC 2573 (Admin). The exercise of powers in this
case did not engage either Article 10 ECHR or the protections accorded to
journalistic material under Schedule 5 to TACT because (a) the MPS did not
know or believe that Mr Miranda had acquired the material for the purposes
of journalism; and (b) Mr Miranda did not when questioned claim to be a
journalist or to be carrying the material on behalf of anyone else who was a
journalist or to have acquired the material for the purposes of journalism.

The law

The power to question

3.	Section 53 TACT gives effect to Schedule 7.

4.	Para. 2 of Schedule 7 confers power on "an examining officer" to question a person
"for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person falling within
section 40( I Xb)'T see para. 2(1). By para. 2(2), it applies to a person if:

"(a) he is at a port or in the border area; and

(b)	the examining officer believes that the person's presence at the port
or in the area is connected with his entering or leaving Great Britain or
Northern Ireland or his travelling by air within Great Britain or within
Northern Ireland."

By para. 2(3), the power to question also applies to a person "on a ship or aircraft
which has arrived at any place in Great Britain or Northern Ireland (whether form
within Great Britain or Northern Ireland)". By para. 2(4), an examining officer may
exercise his powers under para. 2 "whether or not he has grounds tor suspecting
that a person falls within section 40(l)(b)'\

5.	Section 40(1 )(b) covers a person who "is, or has been, concerned in the
commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism".

6.	Terrorism is defined by s. 1 as follows:

"(1) In this Act terrorism' means the use or threat of action where —

(a)	the action falls within subsection (2),

3

(b)	the use or threat is designed to influence the government [or an
international governmental organisation] or to intimidate the
public or a section of the public, and

(c)	the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political,
religious, racial or ideological cause.

(2)	Action falls within this subsection if it—

(a)	involves serious violence against a person,

(b)	involves serious damage to property,

(c)	endangers a person's life, other than that of the person
committing the action,

(d)	creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a
section of the public,

(e)	is designed to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic
system.

The powers to detain and search persons and detain things

7.	Para. 6(1) of Schedule 7 confers on an examining officer the power (a) to stop a
person and (b) to detain a person "for the purpose of exercising a power under
paragraph 2 ', but, only for a maximum period of nine hours.

8.	Para. 8 confers on an examining officer powers of search in relation to a person
questioned under para. 2. The power may be exercised "for the purpose of
determining whether he falls within section 40(l)(b)v.

9.	Para. 11 confers on the examining officer power to detain for 7 days anything given
to the examining officer or seized during questioning.

The obligations of the person examined

10.	Para. 5 imposes upon a person questioned under para. 2 the obligations, inter alia,

(a)	to give the examining officer any information in his possession which the
officer requests and (d) to give the examining officer on request any document
which he has with him and which is of a kind specified by the officer.

11.	Para. 18 makes it an offence wilfully to fail to comply with a duty imposed under or
by virtue of Sch. 7 or wilfully to obstruct or seek to frustrate a search or
examination under or by virtue of Sch. 7.

The Code of Practice

12.	Under powers conferred by para. 6(1) of Sch. 14 to TACT, the Home Office has
issued a Code of Practice (the Code) for examining officers.

13.	At paras 9 and 10, the Code provides:

"9. The purpose of questioning and associated powers to determine
whether a person appears to be someone who is or has been concerned
in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The
powers, which are additional to the powers of arrest under the Act,
should not be used for any other purpose.

10.	An examining officer may question a person whether or not he
suspects that the person is or has been concerned in the commission,
preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism and may stop that
person for the purposes of determining whether this appears to be the
case. Examining officers should therefore make every reasonable effort
to exercise the powers in such a way as to minimise causing
embarrassment or offence to a person who is being questioned.”

14.	The accompanying Notes for guidance underline that the powers must be used
' proportionately, reasonably, with respect and without unlawful discrimination”.
They go on to say that “[examining officers must take particular care to ensure that
the selection of persons for examination is not solely based on their perceived
ethnic background or religion.” The powers are not to be exercised so as to
‘ unfairly discriminate” against anyone on the grounds, inter alia, of race, colour,
religion or creed.

Case law interpreting Schedule 7

15.	Sch. 7 was considered by Collins J in CC v Commissioner of Police for the
Metropolis [2011] EWHC 3316 (Admin), [2012] 1 WLR 1913. Collins J made
these observations about the circumstances in which the power may be used:

T4... in fact, as must be obvious, the existence of prior information is
likely in many eases to mean that an examination will be considered

necessary. But the officers are able to act on an intuitive basis even if
no prior information exists.

15.	The wording of section 40(1 )(b) is important. It in my judgment
recognises that it must be open to an officer to act under Schedule 7 to
determine whether a person appears to be or to have been concerned
and to identify any acts constituting that concern. Thus, even if it
appears that he has in the past been concerned in any such acts, it is
open to the officer to examine him to determine whether he is still so
concerned. Equally, it may be apparent that he is concerned in acts
against a foreign government, but it must be open to officers to examine
him to determine whether his acts affect this country or, indeed, any
country other than that affected by his known acts...

16.	it in my view goes further than those obvious requirements which
are essential to fulfil the purpose of the Schedule 7 powers, namely the
protection of the inhabitants of this (or indeed any other) country from
acts of terrorism. If officers are informed by the Security Service or
from any other source that a person, who appears to be a terrorist, is
suspected of possible involvement with others in a specific terrorist
plot,, they may examine him for the purpose of determining whether he
appears to be so involved. This is because the language of section
40(1 )(b) is wide enough to allow for examination not only of whether
he appears to be a terrorist but also of the way in which or the act by
which he so appears. The officer is not, unless the powers are to be
ineffective in their purpose to protect from terrorism, prevented from
examining a person even if it appears he is a terrorist in particular
respects, for example if in the past or by acts only affecting a foreign
government/"

16.	At [17]-[18], Collins J rejected the submission that an examination must come to an
end once the examining officer determines that the person being examined is, or is
not, a terrorist:

'17... First, the determination is not necessarily one for the examining
officer. For example, searches may have taken place or samples taken
and examination of anything obtained may show that an apparent
concern in the relevant acts was not correct. It may therefore be
important that all relevant information is obtained. Secondly, the
apparent concern may be of past or particular acts amounting to
terrorism and it may be important to see how far such concern goes.
Thirdly, there may be a stage at which the officer is persuaded that the
person concerned is a terrorist but further examination may dispel that
view. It must be for the officer to judge when the examination should
come to an end. No doubt his conclusion will then be forwarded to his
superiors and the Security Service to see whether surveillance is

6

required or there is sufficient to arrest under section 41 , The officer
himself has the power of arrest under section 41 , but I would suppose
that he would not save in the clearest case exercise that power, it might
be necessary if the officer were satisfied that the person concerned was
a danger and needed to be kept in custody, but that could sometimes be
addressed by informing the Home Office who could then impose
immigration or other controls.

18... There may come a point when the officer does consider that the
examinee does not appear to be a terrorist, but his conclusion may not
be shared by others and may, when what has emerged from the
examination or any search is put together with other material which
may, for example, be in the possession of the Security Service be
shown to be wrong. Equally, further examination may show that the
officer's view formed at a particular point was wrong. Again, in my
view he must be able to ask all questions that he reasonably believes to
be needed to enable him or others to reach the necessary
determination.1'

17.	At [18], Collins J rejected a submission that the power to search was confined more
narrowly than the power to question. At [20], he made plain that the existence of a
power to arrest does not imply a duty to do so, nor does it imply that the Sch. 7
power is unavailable.

18.	On the facts, Collins J concluded at [34] that the powers conferred by Sch. 7 had
been exercised for a purpose which ;had nothing to do with determining whether
[the claimant] was a terrorist in any particular way A At [35], he said this:

"I have no doubt that this is a very rare case and that this decision will
not damage the efficacy of the powers. They are properly given a wide
construction for the reasons 1 have set out but cannot extend to the facts
of this case. ’1

19.	More recently, in Beghal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] EWHC 2573
(Admin) the Divisional Court (Gross LJ, Swift & Foskett JJ) considered and
dismissed a wide-ranging human rights challenge to the powers conferred by Sch.

7.	The legislative history is set out at [35]-[52]. The views of successive
Independent Reviewers of Terrorism Legislation (Lord Carlile of Berriew QC and
David Anderson QC) are noted at [53]-[67]. As to the compatibility of the Sch. 7
powers with Article 8 ECHR, the Court distinguished the power considered by the
House of Lords in R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2006]
IJKHL; [2006] 2 AC 307 and Gillan v United Kingdom (2010) 50 EHRR 1105. At

7

[90]	, Gross LJ (giving the judgment of the Court) referred to the Code as affording
;'a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the Executive". At

[91]	, he added;

"In our judgment port and border control is very different from a power
to stop and search, potentially exercisable anywhere in the jurisdiction.
Conclusions as to the arbitrariness of the latter do not readily, still less
necessarily, translate into conclusions as to the former. As Schedule 7,
para. 2 {supra) makes clear, the relevant powers apply only to a limited
category of people — namely those 'at a port or in the border area’,
where 'the examining officer believes that the person’s presence... is
connected with his entering or leaving...’ the country and also to a
person on a ship or aircraft which has arrived at any place in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. That the category of persons to whom
Schedule 7 powers are applicable may itself be numerically large is
neither here nor there; port and border controls cannot be simplistieally
assimilated with generalised powers of stop and search exercisable
anywhere in any circumstances."

20.	At [94], Gross LJ again stressed the importance of port and border controls. At
[95], he noted that the powers were "applicable only to a limited category of
people, as explained earlier: namely, travellers in confined geographical areas"; and
noted that the statistics bore out the proportionate use of the powers. At [96]
reliance was placed on the limited purpose for which the powers could be
exercised. At [97], Gross LJ noted that:

"...the Schedule 7 powers, though principally exercised by police
officers, are an aspect of port and border control rather than of a
criminal investigation. Viewed in this context, it is perhaps unsurprising
that there is no requirement of reasonable suspicion for the powers to be
exercised (as made clear by Schedule 7, para. 2(4) ). At all events,
having regard to the context, the absence of a requirement of reasonable
suspicion does not lend any or significant support to the Appellant's
case that these powers are exercised arbitrarily. Realistically, in the
present context, the requirement of reasonable suspicion would deter
the proper exercise of Schedule 7 powers and render them all too easy
to evade, so increasing the risk to the public."

At [98], Gross LJ drew attention to the importance of the purpose served by Sch. 7,
namely, protecting the public from terrorism, having regard to its international
character.

8

21.	At [112], Gross LJ concluded that the Sch. 7 powers strike "a fair balance...
between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community'' and that
the Article 8 challenge therefore failed. At [113], he held that the conclusions
reached in relation to Article 8 were also applicable to the Article 5 claim, which
therefore also failed.

22.	So far as Article 6 is concerned, Gross LJ held at [129] that:

' Overall, as a matter of reality, the examination of the Appellant under
Schedule 7 was not an inquiry preparatory to criminal proceedings. This
examination was in no sense part of the scheme under PACE. It was
instead an inquiry relating to border control with the specific public
interest of safeguarding society from the risk of terrorism. The purpose
of the exercise of these Schedule 7 powers of examination is separate
and distinct from that relating to the instigation of criminal
proceedings.''

For that reason, the conclusion was drawn at [133] that the examination under Sch.
7 did not engage the Claimant's rights under Article 6. Even if it had been, s. 78 of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), which enables a criminal court to
exclude evidence, provided a sufficient safeguard preventing the unfair use of
material obtained pursuant to Sch. 7; so that even if Article 6 had been engaged, it
would not have been violated: see at [143].

The facts of this case

23.	The background to the use of the Sch. 7 powers in this case is set out in detail in the
witness statements of Acting Detective Inspector "A" and Detective Superintendent

J	"B". It is not repeated here. However, the essence can be stated as follows.

24.	Mr Miranda was stopped as a result of a joint Security Service/MPS operation.

25.	DSupt "B ' received information from the Security Service that Mr Snowden had
highly sensitive information stolen from the UK intelligence community. Mr
Snowden and his associates had begun and were continuing to disseminate this
information. It was known that Glenn Greenwald, a freelance journalist working for
The Guardian, together with an individual in Berlin (Ms Poitras), were involved.
Mr Miranda was Mr Greenwald's husband and he would be travelling from Berlin

9

to Rio de Janeiro through Heathrow. It was thought possible that Mr Miranda
could be carrying at least some of the stolen classified material.

26.	If so, the Security Service wanted to obtain the material in order to gain an insight
into what UK classified material, if any, it was thought that Mr Miranda might be
carrying; to deny the use of that material; and to increase their intelligence coverage
in order to protect UK national security.

27.	The MPS, however, considered separately what powers they could and should
exercise. Consideration was given to arresting Mr Miranda, but the decision was
taken that there was not enough information to justify an arrest. DSupt TU
understood that Mr Snowden had been allowed to stay in Russia for a year. He
considered it possible that Mr Snowden might have passed material to a third party
State or to non State actors. He thought it possible that disclosure had been or might
be made by Mr Snowden and/or a third party State or to non State actors that
endangered life, created a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or were
designed seriously to disrupt an electronic system. He considered that such
disclosure might have been made with the intention of influencing the UK
Government; and that they may have been made for the purpose of advancing a
political or ideological cause.

28.	The decision to authorise the stop was taken by Acting Detective Inspector "A’’,
who was responsible for the team at Heathrow Airport. The case for the stop was
communicated directly by the Security Service to him. It was contained in a Ports
Circulation Sheet (PCS), initially, the PCS did not contain enough information to
enable ADI "A” to authorise the stop. However, in its final form, the justification
advanced by the Security Service was accepted. It was in these terms:

'Intelligence indicates that MIRANDA is likely to be involved in
espionage activity which has the potential to act against the interests of
UK national security. We therefore wish to establish the nature of
MIRANDA'S activity, assess the risk that MIRANDA poses to UK
national security and mitigate as appropriate. We are requesting that
you exercise your powers to carry out a ports stop against MIRANDA.

We assess that MIRANDA is knowingly carrying material, the release
of which would endanger people's lives. Additionally the disclosure, or
threat of disclosure, is designed to influence a government, and is made
for the purpose of promoting a political or ideological cause. This

10

therefore falls within the definition of terrorism and as such we request
that the subject is examined under Schedule 7.’’

29.	After he had been stopped, Mr Miranda was questioned and a record made of the
questions posed and answers given. He was offered food and water, given the
opportunity to take medication (after consulting a forensic medical examiner) and
attempts (at his request) were made to contact Mr Greenwald. He was offered legal
representation and in due course a representative from Bindmans attended. He was
released after nine hours.

Ground 1: The use of Schedule 7

30.	Mr Miranda alleges that:

30.1.	Sch. 7 "appear[s] to have been exercised... in order to retrieve the material in
his possession which may have originated from Mr Snowden; and/or to
question the Claimant in relation to his involvement in those disclosures'’:
Grounds for Judicial Review, §49; and

30.2.	this was done in order to ^bypass the appropriate statutory regimes for
obtaining confidential journalistic information and circumvented the
important statutory safeguards (including the requirement to obtain a court
order before seizing material) contained in those mechanisms1’: Grounds for
Judicial Review, §52(7). In this context, reference is made to Sch. 5 to TACT,
which contains in paras 5-10 special protections for (inter alia) journalistic
material.



n

31.	As to the first of these points, it is true that the Security Service wanted to retrieve
the material which it was thought that Mr Miranda might be carrying and to prevent
its further dissemination. However, the evidence makes plain that the MPS did not
unthinkingly execute a Security Service plan. Both DSupt ‘TV' and Acting DI "A"
considered separately whether the preconditions for the exercise of the Sch. 7
power were met (the focus must of course be on the decision of the officer at the
Port - Acting DI "A" - that it was proper to exercise Sch. 7 powers in relation to Mr
Miranda). But both he and DSupt "B" concluded that the conditions for the exercise
of the Sch 7 powers were satisfied. They were right to do so because:

31.1.	The purpose for which the Sch. 7 power may be exercised is determining
whether it appears that the person being examined is a person failing within
section 40(1 )(b). To exercise the power, it was not necessary to have a
reasonable suspicion, let alone a concluded view, that Mr Miranda was a
person falling within s.40(l)(b).

31.2.	Section 40(1 )(b) is drafted broadly. It covers those who are or have been
"concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of
terrorism5'. That formulation covers any kind of participation.

31.3.	All the elements of s. 1(1) TACT were satisfied. As to (a), the MPS properly
took the view (on the basis of what it had been told by the Security Service)
that disclosure(s) of the material which it was thought that Mr Miranda might
be carrying might endanger lives and/or create a risk to public safety and,
additionally, might have been designed seriously to interfere with an
electronic system. As to (b), the MPS properly took the view that the
disclosures might have been intended by Mr Snowden to influence the UK
Government. It was known that Mr Snowden had been allowed to stay in
Russia for a year. It was not known what (if anything) he had disclosed, or
agreed to disclose, to a third party State or to non State actors, nor what was
the intention or motivation behind any disclosures. As to (c), the MPS
properly assessed that the disclosures might have been made for the purpose
of advancing a political or ideological cause. In the circumstances, it was
proper to exercise the Sch. 7 powers for the purposes of determining whether
Mr Miranda was a person falling within s. 40(1 )(b).

12

32. As to the second allegation, the reference to provisions according special protection

for journalistic material are not relevant here because:

32.1.	The powers conferred by Sch. 5 and Sch. 7 deal with different situations. Sch.
5 powers are appropriate to, and apply, only when material is sought for the
purposes of a criminal investigation. Sch. 7 confers powers which apply when
no criminal investigation is on foot. They are conferred for a different
purpose and apply at an earlier stage: see eg Beghal, per Gross LJ at [97] and
[129].

32.2.	In any event, the evidence does not establish that the material was in fact
"journalistic materiar as defined in TACT (by reference to s. 13 of PACE).
Mr Miranda did not and does not claim to be a journalist. He denied that he
was carrying the material for anyone else. Even when his legal representative
attended, no suggestion was made that the material was "journalistic
material” for the purposes of PACE or TACT.

32.3.	insofar as the protections accorded to journalistic material are designed to
protect sources, there is on the current evidence nothing to indicate that the
material revealed any journalistic source that had not already been made
public. Mr Snowden had, of course, decided to reveal his identity. Ms Poitras’
involvement was also in the public domain. Nothing in the material currently
accessed indicates any other source.

32.4.	Finally, even if the material was 'acquired for the purposes of journalism”
within the meaning of s. 13 of PACE, the protections of the special regimes
applicable to such material do not apply where - as in the present case - the
material was stolen or obtained unlawfully: see by analogy Welwyn Hatfield
Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government [2011] UKSC 15 [2011] 2 AC 304.

Ground 2: Transit passengers

33.	Under his second .ground, the Claimant contends that Schedule 7 confers no power
to question or detain transit passengers because a transit passenger's presence at a
port or airport is not "connected with his entering or leaving Great Britain or
Northern Ireland” for the purposes of para. 2(2)(b) of Schedule 7.

13

34.	The basis for this contention is that the phrase ''entering... Great Britain or Northern
Ireland" is to be understood by reference to the ease law on the concept of entering
the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971.

35.	The short answer to the point is that there is nothing in TACT to indicate that the
phrase "entering... Great Britain and Northern Ireland" was intended to have the
same meaning as the equivalent phrase in the Immigration Act 1971. The two Acts
are not in pari materia.

36.	it is easy to see that, in creating immigration offences of illegally entering the
United Kingdom, Parliament would not have wished to catch transit passengers.
That explains the decision of the House of Lords in R v Naillie [1993] 1 AC 674,
680. But the Schedule 7 power is not concerned with immigration. It is applicable
to travellers using ports and airports even when they are travelling internally and to
travellers on board ships or aircraft even when they are simply using a UK port or
airport to transit.

37.	if the Claimant were correct, Schedule 7 would confer power to question and
detain:

37.1.	passengers at ports or airports who have no intention of crossing any borders
because they are travelling internally (see the final words of para. 2(2)(b),
inserted by the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001);

37.2.	passengers who are on ships or aircraft that have arrived in the United
Kingdom from abroad, even if they are in transit to another country and do
not intend to go through passport control (para. 2(3));

but not:

37.3.	transit passengers who have disembarked from their aircraft.

38.	In other words, on this construction, the Police could have detained Mr Miranda
while he was on the aircraft (even though he had only arrived for the purposes of
transit) but not once he left it.

39.	ft is difficult to see why Parliament should have intended such a construction. The
context suggests that para. 2(2)(b) serves an altogether different purpose: ensuring

14

that the Schedule 7 power is not used in respect of persons whose presence at the
port or airport is not connected with travelling at all (eg port or airport staff).

Ground 3: Convention compatibility

40.	As to the alleged breach of Articles 5, 6 and 8 ECHR, the powers conferred by Sch.
7 have been held by the Divisional Court to be lawful and proportionate: see
BeghaL This Court should follow Beg ha l: see R v Greater Manchester Coroner ex
p Tal [1985] QB 67, 79e-81e.

41.	As to the alleged breach of Article 10:

41.1.	tt is unclear whose Article 10 rights are being asserted here. Mr Miranda did
not claim when questioned to be a journalist or to be carrying the material
seized on behalf of any other person. He did not assert (and nor did his
representative) that the material had been acquired for the purposes of
journalism.

41.2.	in any event, the focus of the Strasbourg authorities on Article 10 is the
protection of journalistic sources: see eg Telegraaf Media Nederland
Landelijke Media BV et alv Netherlands, application No.39315/06 (2012) 34
BHRC 193, at [86]; Goodwin v United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 123, at
[39]; Roemen and Schmit v Luxembourg, application No.51772/9, at [47];
Financial Times Ltd et al v United Kingdom, application No.821/03, at [70]-
[71]. There is no evidence that the material seized reveals any journalistic
source who was not already prominently in the public domain,

41.3.	In any event, there is no principle to be derived from the Article 10 case law
that journalistic material cannot be seized by a procedure which does not
involve a judicial decision. In particular, Sanoma v Netherlands, application
38224/03 does not establish any such general principle. It can be
distinguished on its facts because it concerned a seizure in the context of
criminal proceedings and did not concern terrorism.

Conclusion

42.	For the reasons set out above, the court is respectfully invited to dismiss this claim.

15

Post-script: Relief

43.	If, contrary to the Second Defendant’s position outlined above, the Court were to
find that the exercise of Schedule 7 powers in this case was not lawful, then the
Second Defendant would wish to advance further, separate submissions on the
issue of relief having regard, in particular, to the nature of the contents of the
material in issue, and the progress (at that stage) of the investigations which are
being conducted into the material.
