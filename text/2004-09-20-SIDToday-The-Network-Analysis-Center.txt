DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S//SI) The Network Analysis Center<br>FROM: <br>Chief, NAC (S31SD)<br>Run Date: 09/20/2004<br><br>(TS//SI) In the last DA Note to the Workforce , we talked about recent and on-going activities<br>designed to connect efforts in our line organizations and around the extended enterprise. Today<br>we focus on the Network Analysis Center (NAC), one of three key SIGINT development centers,<br>providing analysis of our most challenging target networks.<br>(TS//SI) The NAC consists of a skilled cadre of Collection Managers, Computer Scientists,<br>Engineers, Intelligence Analysts, Network Engineers and Mathematicians all performing Network<br>Analysis in order to isolate and obtain access to a myriad of targets within the worldwide digital<br>network. Network Analysis performed by the division is conducted using a variety of data<br>sources, to include open source data, routing protocol data as well as other forms of SIGINT data<br>in order to achieve this goal. As the worldwide network has exploded into the choice form of<br>communication for many targets, NAC is called upon from various elements within both the<br>Analysis and Production and Data Acquisition Directorates in order to assist with both tactical<br>and strategic Network Analysis needs.<br>(TS//SI) The result of NAC's work can be seen through the variety of different tasks we perform.<br>For example, NAC played an instrumental part during the January 2004 apprehension of key Al<br>Qaida operatives within Iraq - namely Husam al-Yemeni, aka Firas -- and the 30 May capture of<br>Umar Baziyani. We've assisted the Office of Regional Targets with developing a more complete<br>understanding <br> infrastructure. We've also assisted<br>this same office with the development of an important digital network associated with<br>Venezuela's leader, Victor Chavez. We regularly assist the Office of Counterterrorism with the<br>daily tracking of several key targets as they move throughout the worldwide digital network.<br>(TS//SI) As well as dealing with current Network Analysis needs, NAC looks to the future needs<br>of the Directorate and ways we can assist in a proactive manner versus a reactionary mode. A<br>few examples of this can be witnessed through anticipatory development efforts we completed in<br>preparation for the 2004 Olympics. We're also spearheading efforts to apply Network Analysis<br>techniques to the analysis of special source data in support of current counter-terrorism needs<br>as well as future needs of operationas against the AQSL (al-Qa'ida Senior Leadership).<br>(TS//SI) And if all this isn't impressive enough, NAC also realizes the importance of not only<br>tracking targets within the worldwide web, but also keeping abreast of the current network<br>technologies used by those targets. To that end, NAC currently holds chairmanship of both the<br>Agency's Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Wireless DNI working groups. Additionally, our<br>Routing Protocols Working Group is working to define smart ways to infuse routing/routed<br>protocol analysis into our mainstream Network Analysis methods.<br>(S//SI) For more information on NAC, please refer to our webpage by typing "go NAC" from any<br>browser.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p>DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
