feditl BROAD OAK HRA justifications in other tools

The BROAD OAK tool provides links to both content and events interfaces. The appropriate HRA
justification fields in BROAD OAK arc pulled through to these interfaces and populate the HRA
justification fields in the interface. If you choose to work in this way, you must ensure that your HRA
justification in BROAD OAK also justifies your intrusion into the communications of or associated with
your target.

feditl Auditor's Responsibility

Whilst the Legal and Policy Lead for each business unit has overall responsibility for audits, he or she
may devolve responsibility for individual audits to a chief auditor (sec audit community* for full list). The
LPL or other delegated person is responsible for ensuring recommendations for improving standards
made by the auditors are followed up. The chief auditor is responsible for the following:

and adhoc spot-checks

•	providing OPP-LEG with the audit report using the audit template

•	ensuring that the report is sent to OPP-LEG by no later than the first week after the month in which
the audit was completed (eg audit conducted in May, report must be with OPP-LEG by first week in
June)

•	cither completing the audit him/hcrsclf or devolving the audit burden amongst a team of established
auditors

•	informing record owners or team leaders of changes required to records that do not meet the criteria
or need to be improved

•	confirming that the necessary changes have been implemented within the two-week deadline

•	engaging with line managers or business unit heads if analysts fail to comply with requests for
amendments, to ensure prompt action is taken

•	advising analysts of shortcomings noted in records that cannot be amended (one-off queries) to
assist with improvements in future queries

•	making recommendations on how to improve standards of compliance

•	advising OPP-LEG about potential improvements to the audit process or of changes to the systems
