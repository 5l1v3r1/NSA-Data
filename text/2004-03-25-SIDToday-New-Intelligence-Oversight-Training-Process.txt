For the first time, all SID<br>employees will be able to access the required reading and register their compliance in a common<br>way via the web. Our hope is that the system will also help us provide more comprehensive<br>compliance statistics to the NSA Inspector General's office.<br>(U) Please read the 5 W's below for more information on what this means to you:<br>WHO : (U//FOUO) The requirement applies to ALL SID EMPLOYEES , including civilians, military,<br>contractors and integrees. In general, if your organizational designator begins with "S," you<br>should be using this process. However, it is not meant to supplant other systems in use by<br>external elements. Most field sites, for example, already have similar web-based systems that<br>employees at those locations should continue to use.<br>WHAT : (U//FOUO) The basic I/O training requirement is to read annually the legal documents<br>that govern our mission in SID. There are now five documents that you are asked to review:<br>Executive Order 12333,<br>USSID 18,<br>NSCID 6,<br>DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and<br>NSA Directive 10-30.<br>The first three are the core documents covering NSA's legal authorities and restrictions and the<br>definition of SIGINT. The latter two implement the Executive Order within DoD and NSA, so it's<br>important to be familiar with them as DoD/NSA employees.<br>WHERE : (U//FOUO) The documents can be accessed via the NSA web at the SID I/O training<br>webpage . The first time you log on to the system you'll be asked to register and obtain a<br>password. In subsequent visits to the site, you will simply enter your user ID along with that<br>password. You are not expected to read all the documents at once. While the system cannot<br>bookmark your place in each document, it will keep track of each document you have<br>completed.<br>WHEN : (U) You may log on to the system at any time to begin. You are asked to have your<br>reading completed by the end of fiscal year, i.e., by 30 September 2004.<br>WHY : (U//FOUO) The basic principle behind these documents is the right to privacy. Since the<br>SID mission involves electronic surveillance, it is subject to strict control under the U.S.<br>Constitution, federal law, and Executive Branch regulations designed to protect the fundamental<br>privacy rights of U.S. persons. Familiarity with the above documents is therefore an important<br>responsibility of every SID employee.<br>(U//FOUO) Thank you for your cooperation in using this new process and completing the<br>required reading by the end of the fiscal year. I'd also like to thank those in SID who tested the<br>system and/or helped incorporate enhanced features, our IAD colleagues who shared their<br>expertise with us, and especially our colleagues in the Corporate Applications Division, DC82,<br>who provided the application and worked closely with us to customize it for SID use.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
