>■ Primary Goal: To enable on-net access to
target networks via off-net capabilities.

Prerequisite: We need to find the network
of interest in order to target it.

Procedure: Conduct passive survey to
locate network, then perform active op.

^ Solution: Utilize BLINDDATE and the
appropriate plug-in solution(s).

Successful operation of BLINDDATE is
essential to correct usage of plug-ins.

Two types of plug-ins exist:

| Analysis Tool Aids
] Active CNE Tools

>■ We will focus on Active CNE Tools:

BLINDDATE used as both a survey and
vulnerability analysis tool for 802.11
networks.

>- Operator needs to know what
vulnerabilities, or criteria, to look for in order
to utilize the correct Active CNE Tool (if any)

^ We will focus primarily on criteria
necessary to carry out NIGHTSTAND (NS)
and BADDECISION (BDN) operations.

^ What is our end goal?

Provide on-net access via off-net means.
How do we do that?

Redirect the target to the TAO infrastructure.

How do we do that?

Inject payload destined for the target client.

What does that do exactly?

Forces the target to covertly contact a
FOX ACID server.

>• What is FOXACID suppose to do?

5^ Perform vulnerability analysis and exploitation
of the target (if possible).

ACCESS

^ FOXACID is the cover term for a DNT/ROC
project to deliver content based exploits
(CBE) to web browsers.

The greatest vulnerability to your
computer: your web browser.

^ FOXACID Servers sit on Internet.

Publicly addressable, DNS resolved.
Utilizes whitelist for security, filtering.

Requires specially crafted URL tag to
contact FA Servers (FOXACID Tag).

Redirection to FOXACID

CLOSE
ACCESS

A FOXACID Tag is a special URL pointing
to a particular FOXACID Server.

Contacting the FA Server will (hopefully)
result in the contactor being exploited.

>■ We want the target to be exploited.

>■ How do we redirect the target to the
FOXACID Server without being noticed.
