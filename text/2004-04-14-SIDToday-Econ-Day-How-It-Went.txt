Well over 100 external guests gathered here at NSA on Friday, 2 April<br>2004, for Global Economic Security Day. As part of SID's Customer Engagement Program, a new<br>strategy called "Customer Days" has been implemented. "Econ Day" is the second in the series,<br>following behind the highly successful "Law Enforcement, Intelligence Community, Homeland<br>Security Day" in December 2003. Nearly 200 SID managers and analysts also participated in the<br>morning and afternoon sessions, bringing the Friedman Auditorium to near capacity.<br>(C) Ambassadors, Under and Assistant Secretaries, Directors, managers at every level, and<br>analysts from varied disciplines -- from State, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, Energy,<br>Transportation, the National Security Council, Executive Office of the President, Federal Reserve,<br>Export-Import Bank, CIA, DIA, NGA, JWAC, FAA, FCC, EPA -- attended the event. Hosted by the<br>SIGINT Directorate's Customer Relationships Directorate, this event was the first interagency<br>forum bringing together policy makers, intelligence managers, and analysts from across the U.S.<br>Economic and Intelligence Communities in a secure setting to exchange information and to<br>promote understanding and networking opportunities.<br>(U//FOUO) The Friedman Auditorium was filled for the morning plenary session. Alan Larson,<br>Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, gave the Keynote<br>Address, speaking on the "Importance of Economics in the Geopolitical Context - the Nexus of<br>Economic Policy and Foreign Policy." Other plenary presentations included the "Role of<br>Intelligence to further US Policy" and the "NSA Perspective: the Evolution of NSA reporting in the<br>Post 9/11 Period and the Impact on Economic Intelligence." The morning culminated with a<br>distinguished panel of representative economic clients who described their information needs<br>and the value of SIGINT to their respective missions with representation by the appropriate<br>Senior Executive Account Managers.<br>(C ) The afternoon featured 11 breakout sessions in conference rooms booked to capacity with a<br>cross section of participants - from Under Secretaries to analysts - from across the Community.<br>These sessions offered wide-ranging economic discussions on regional issues such as trends in<br>East Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America as well as on topical issues such as information<br>technology dependency, threats to economic security, terrorism finance, sanctions, infectious<br>diseases, trade, energy, and the complexities of assessing economic information. Participants<br>have already begun to plan follow on activities to develop contacts made at the sessions and for<br>further networking.<br>(U//FOUO) The conference was planned and presented by the SID Customer Gateway and the<br>Strategic Intelligence Issues Office, but it couldn't have happened without the support and<br>assistance of scores of people across SID, NSA, and from partner agencies.<br>(U) Thanks are in order -- to all those who helped and especially to the participants whose<br>presence made the event a success.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on the agenda and speakers, type "go Econ".
