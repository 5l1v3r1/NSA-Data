The benefits of this are clear: anything that will save analysts time and effort (and<br>annoyance) will result in higher productivity and greater accuracy in getting the reports where<br>they need to go, in the proper format.<br>(U//FOUO) One effort in this regard is the development of an Information Needs (IN) Matcher,<br>which will help analysts determine which INs and key facts (Essential Elements of Information,<br>or EEI's) are associated with their reports. This will no doubt come as a relief to the analysts,<br>who have felt overwhelmed in performing the necessary research to properly cite INs while the<br>number of INs has continued to grow.<br>(U//FOUO) Development of the IN Matcher has taken place in two phases. First, an IN Matcher<br>prototype has been created. It is based on a Production Services (S21) pilot that was designed<br>to ease the transition from the old NSRS (National SIGINT Requirements System) to the new<br>NSRP (National SIGINT Requirements Process). In the second phase, multiple approaches and<br>technologies will be evaluated in a laboratory environment to see which technology (algorithms)<br>work best. One tactic was to create a web site that "suggests" appropriate INs for draft reports.<br>If the performance is good, then the tool could be integrated into report authoring tools.<br>(U//FOUO) Where are we now?<br>The preliminary operational testing of the prototype has been conducted.<br>The laboratory testing will be conducted from March through July.<br>Upon conclusion of the testing, the laboratory results will be analyzed and a plan developed for<br>next steps in acquisition and integration into the IN Matcher tool.<br>(U//FOUO) The initial testing showed fair results with the INs, but poor results with EEIs.<br>Customer Gateway (S11) is working with S2 to adjust the operational test plan, and with the<br>vendor to evaluate the results. They are also finalizing the evaluation plan for the laboratory. At<br>a recent stakeholder conference, key partners and stakeholders reviewed the evaluation plan<br>and evaluation criteria, and recommended products to test. Customer Gateway appreciates the<br>collaboration of many analysts from S12, the Advanced Analytic Lab, RAD, TRAILBLAZER, CMM,<br>and other organizations as they work to make the IN Matcher a reality!<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on the IN Matcher, please contact these poc's:<br> Technical Leader, Customer Gateway (S11) (<br> SETA Support, Customer Gateway <br><br>)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
