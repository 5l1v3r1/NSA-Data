But I don't think so. Now, to add to my confusion, I have been hearing another term:<br>TechSIGINT. Huh?<br>(U) This is the straw that broke the camel's back! I couldn't take it anymore so I asked someone<br>who should know, and this is what he told me:<br>(U) ELINT stands, as always, for Electronic Intelligence.<br>(U//FOUO) Many, many years ago, the portion of the Intel Community working ELINT (which<br>includes many military organizations) split the discipline of ELINT into the two main categories<br>(OPELINT &amp; TechELINT: these terms have been in use for over 4 decades).<br>(U//FOUO) OPELINT stands for Operational ELINT and its product is often of high value to<br>tactical military users since it gives specific info about a threat emitter's location, how often it<br>operates, it's type, what function it's performing, various parameters and characteristics of it's<br>emission, and the like, but no detailed technical characteristics.<br>(U//FOUO) TechELINT stands for (you guessed it) Technical ELINT. The product from<br>TechELINT comes from careful, detailed analysis of the signals collected from ELINT emitters.<br>The analysis often leads to the understanding of what kind of emitter is radiating the signal,<br>what its function is, and all kinds of data on its characteristics. In fact, for newly intercepted<br>emitters, it is vital to do the TechELINT work so that there will eventually be OPELINT available<br>(since you can't produce the operational product until the emitter is fully known and<br>understood). Also, the tech work is required in order for the military services to build<br>sophisticated threat warning receivers and electronic warfare devices (jammers and more).<br>(U//FOUO) Now for the nouveau (at least to me) TechSIGINT term. Technical SIGINT includes<br>all ELINT, as well as FISINT and PROFORMA and even Communications Externals (external<br>characteristics of COMINT signals; not the internal structure or data/traffic content).<br>(U) So, how's that? Need any more info? You can find it on the Weapons &amp; Space web page .<br>(U) Pretty good, I think. But, I'm not putting my name on this just in case it is only me!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
