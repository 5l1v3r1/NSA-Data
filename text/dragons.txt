the outskirts of Darmstadt, Germany. To the passing ECC
motorist, the facility looks like many ofthe other
random U.S. government facilities in the area, with
one exception. Cine can almost hear a discernable
buzz of activity from the of the ECC
executing queries, authoring ?ngerprints, and
consuming metadata garnered from In the past three months,
the ECC has tripled, and even quadrupled in some cases, the number of queries
performed, the number of items pushed tn PINWALE, and the number of sessions
viewed. And these numbers continue tn grow.?f

 

What has been the cause ofthis flurry of success? The ECC points tn a
recent IKE training blitz in support of the Analytic Modernization ?ntr'eaoh
Campaign to encourage discover}; In early March, ECC held
an KRIS Circuit Training event designed to expose to five, Ell-minute
one-on-one sessions in a circuit-type environment. This "speed dating" for KRIS
consisted of five stations covering topics titled "Intro to the GUI and Basic
Queries," "Metadata Setup and Manipulation," "Content and Manipulation of
Results," "Introduction to Fingerprints," and "Introduction to Microplugins."

Dyer four days, 63 students were walked through these topics with five
different instructors, able to ask specific questions and get more comfortable with
the tool. "Everyone likes a new toy, and there was a lot of excitement about it. The
will at least try it against their target and see what they will get out of it," said
_one of the instructors and a Analyst embedded in Africa
Division.

With traditional targeting, cast their nets wide into the murky
waters of network traf?c and haul in anything that gets caught in the net. We are
like Forrest Cump on his shrimping boat off the coast ofAlabama pulling in a boot,
toilet seat, seaweed, and there they three shrimp! We burn up a lot of
resources getting those shrimp, those reportable documents or metadata used to
expand target knowledge, and we deal with tons oftoilet seats, the spam and other
junk. Then, we repeat the same process and hopefully catch enough "shrimp" to
have ourselves a little cocktail. KRIS has become so important because with it,
can downsize their gigantic shrimping nets to tiny, handheld goldfish-sized
nets and merely dip them into the oceans of data, working smarter and scooping
out exactly what they want.

And a short, two-hour class is an easy gamble of time for the hopes of
being able to work smarter and more ef?ciently. ECC have been trading in
their old nets for new ones and are thrilled with their catches. Discovery can only
occur ifpeople are willing to try new things, and more of our are getting
comfortable with leaping into the relatively unknown world of HRS.

"The first time I saw KRIS, I said, 'Whoa!!' It is intimidating because you
open it up and you see all these queries and fields," said_ "We took the
students from that response to being able to approach it and navigate around in it.
They see it differently now and know it's not a seven-headed dragon." This gentle
introduction has definitely enabled to ease into KRIS and get more
comfortable, and with that it has radically changed the overall mentality towards

the tool.

Across the ECC, wholeheartedly agree that the Circuit
Training setup and content was a catalyst to give IKE a try or take existing
users to the next level. The one-on-one setup provided a heavy injection oftool
knowledge into each student. "Before the training, I was just happy jail," said a Circuit Training student and Arabichrench
Language Analyst for CT [Counterterrorism}. "flow I feel comfortable in my ability
jail. I used to always ask someone to look over my query
before I submitted it. blow, my hand doesn't need to be held."

That Circuit Training must be one tough training to pull off, you say? blot
so, says _who spoke about the "off-the-shelf" nature ofthe training. "The
framework was already developed by so it was simple for us to read over
their notes, make it applicable to NSA, and conduct the training. We didn't have to
spend time writing modules."

From the leadership level's perspective, the time invested sending
to the class had a tremendous return. Tech Lead for the
Ell-person strong Africa Division, said, "The brevity of the class made it easy to
send our people. blow we know exactly why we want to use it, and we have
discovered new traf?c and documents. Cur have been building hashes for
document tracking and rolling them into fingerprints. We have been getting
documents in KRIS that we were not getting in our PINWALE queries. just today
found reportable material from the Tunisian Ministry of Interior that was
not from any selectors we were targeting. blow we know what we can do with KRIS
and exactly why we want to use it -- to make these discoveries."

These discoveries are igniting a trend ofusing HES on a daily basis. "For
daily pulls, go through TransK, PINWALE, and now KRIS to see what's new

Combine these exciting finds with the introduction of HRS Skilx points,
and you can see why McDonald's teamed up with Monopoly years ago: people buy
more and even super size their orders just to get game pieces. With the brainchild
ofSkilx, where can earn points and unlock achievements for performing
tasks in KRIS, people are willing to try new things within the tool. think to
themselves, "Using the Pivot Data feature will earn 3D I'm going to try it
and see what happens." Discovery! Points! We have been lured by our geeky desire
to unlock achievements and earn points, and bragging rights are everything.

"Definitely a number ofusers have gotten into the Skilx points. We have
several people at level six. They see what they need to do to earn more points and
start trying out different things," said_ In fact, ECC now have the
highest average of Skilx points compared to all ofthe SE product lines and have
written the most fingerprints per-capita! Some people say that the potent
combination ofSkilx points, the Circuit Training, and the team of easily-accessible,
on-site instructors is the secret to ECC's successes with KRIS.

Maybe KRIS is a seven-headed dragon as _mentioned. Big and
scary? Sure. Strong and powerful? Uh yeah. But, the ECC is taming it, and it is ours
