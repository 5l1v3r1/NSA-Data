(U//FOUO) The 2004 Summer Olympic Games were held 13-29 August 2004 in
Athens, Greece. Athletes from over 200 countries participated in the Games
themselves; over 150 heads of State or heads of government attended at least one
Olympic event; and over 5 billion people watched the Olympics on television or
followed it on the Internet. The Olympic venues were located throughout Greece,
including Athens, Crete, Volos, Patra, Olympia, and Thessaloniki. Such an
important international event with a worldwide audience wrapped to their
television and PCs for two weeks presented a very tempting target for terrorists.

(S//SI) Well before the start of the Summer Games, NSA began supporting
Intelligence Community efforts to:

•	provide Force Protection/Indication and Warning of imminent, indigenous and
transnational threats to U.S. interests in the Olympic area of responsibility
(AOR);

•	develop an awareness of the Greek Government's knowledge of threats to the
Games and or U.S. interests;

•	understand how countries bordering Greece were prepared to respond to a
potential attack; and,

•	support the U.S. Military in any operation to provide assistance to the Greek
Government and/or evacuate U.S. entities from the area.

(S//SI) To accomplish this herculean task, NSA personnel, at the heart of the action
in Athens, were working very closely with the State Department, which was
responsible for providing security for U.S. Olympic officials, judges and athletes --
at the sporting events, the Olympic Village and aboard cruise ships in Piraeus
Harbor serving as floating hotels. From the Olympic AOR, around the world and
back to the Fort, NSA personnel were manning 24-hour watches and operations
while working with Home Land Security, the FBI, NGA, CIA and DIA, as well as
EUCOM and SOCOM in support of NATO. NSA support to the 2004 Summer Games
encompassed a wide range of offices to include:

•	the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD),

•	Installations and Logistics (I&L),

•	Information Technology Infrastructure Services (ITIS),

•	Counterterrorism (CT),

•	International Security Issues (ISI),

•	Customer Relationships (SI),

•	the National Security Operations Center (NSOC),

•	Tailored Access,

•	Link Access,

•	Cryptanalysis and Exploitation (CES),
