(part 2)<br>FROM:<br>NSA Representative to BCBP/BICE (S112)<br>Run Date: 11/22/2004<br><br>Here's the conclusion of our article on border security. Part 1 was posted last week. (U//FOUO)<br>A Closer Look<br>(U) The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) consolidates approximately 40,000<br>employees represented by the uniformed inspector personnel of the United States Customs<br>Service, the former Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization Service--which was abolished as<br>an agency in conjunction with the formation of the Department of Homeland Security--and the<br>Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. BCBP's prime mission is the inspection of all<br>conveyances of transportation, goods, and people that cross our nation's borders and essentially<br>serve as our country's last line of defense.<br>(U) The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE) brings together the<br>enforcement and investigative arms of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service,<br>Federal Protective Service, United States Air Marshals, and the United States Customs Service.<br>This effort involves approximately 20,000 employees committed to enforcing the full range of<br>immigration and customs laws, protection of our federal buildings, and the protection of<br>commercial air travel.<br>SID Support to Border Security<br>(U//FOUO) With the statutory creation of BCBP and BICE on 1 March 2003 in the new<br>Department of Homeland Security, SID readied itself to support any new intelligence structures<br>and requirements. SID's Representative to BCBP and BICE, Mr. <br>, worked from the front<br>lines to keep the corporation and our leadership informed about coming changes and helped<br>educate the "new" customer base about our products and services. NSA's Homeland Security<br>Support Office (D08) was also instrumental in helping SID respond to this transition by hosting<br>numerous briefings by the BCBP and BICE intelligence leadership, as well as analyst exchanges<br>with our Production Lines.<br>(U//FOUO) In actuality, big change comes slowly, and neither NSA nor our customers wanted to<br>disrupt the excellent, long-established SIGINT partnerships. It made sense, therefore, to<br>continue supporting the BCBP and BICE intelligence elements as we had done when they were in<br>legacy Customs and INS. With time, as the new DHS components adjusted to their new home<br>and missions, SID made appropriate updates to the reporting requirements and dissemination<br>lists. Every SID Production Line contributes to the varied missions of BCBP and BICE. If a<br>product deals with issues that may impact our border security, then these organizations should<br>be recipients (check out the MARSP listings for "BICE" and "CUSTOMS").<br>(U//FOUO) Facilitating the BCBP and BICE relationships with SID is the following team:<br>SID Representative to BCBP &amp; BICE: <br> <br>SID Account Manager for BCBP &amp; BICE: <br> <br>SID Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) for BCBP: <br>SID Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) for BICE: <br>NCR/DHS: Larry Castro <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
