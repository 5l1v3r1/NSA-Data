Technical Requirements

The ability to understand and track encryption as well as develop new methods as
outlined above requires the use of existing metadata from NSA and GCHQ
processing system, the ability to create new metadata to test the viability of it’s use
for the creation of new methods and to enhance existing data, the ability to correlate
across what is known (strongly selected content) with metadata and potentially the
ability to examine deeper into sessions for evaluation of exploitability. To accomplish
the goals above, the following will be used in the JC environment:

•	A Joint Collaboration (JC) cloud that contains the following metadata sources:

o	MUTANT BROTH
o BEARDED PIGGY
o KARMA POLICE
o MEMORY HOLE
o MARBLED GECKO
o SOCIAL ANIMAL
o ASDF metadata

•	Selected content

o Related to encryption or specific target sets

•	Ability to create new metadata or selected content as needed through XKS or
other local processing sources.

•	Inclusion of enrichment data

o TBD

•	Ability to interact with CA server internal to the JC environment
