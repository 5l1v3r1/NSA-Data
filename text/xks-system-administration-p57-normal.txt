■ xks_meta_ingester - streams metadata over
socket. This process improves database
performance. Instead of each xscore_proc
writing to the database independently, they
stream their metadata over socket to the
metajngester, which combines it by plugin
and writes to the database.

• Reduces the number of connections to MySQL and
gives better control over table size.
