The following functions within<br>HIGHTIDE will support PKI-encrypted e-mail, using Outlook for Windows systems and Mozilla for<br>Unix:<br>EGRAM Readdressal -- PKI encryption optional<br>TELIR -- PKI encryption optional<br>Free Field (tipper) -- PKI encryption required if sent via email<br>Sensitive Series -- PKI encryption required if sent via email<br>(U//FOUO) Please be advised that, effective 20 November, all e-mail recipients of<br>encrypted HIGHTIDE reports will require PKI certificates . HIGHTIDE will verify that the<br>recipient has a registered PKI certificate before releasing the report to that person. PKIencrypted e-mail may be sent by or to any users who have a registered PKI certificate in<br>Searchlight or in the Second Party database. The Full Service Directory (FSD) that supports<br>Intelligence Community recipients will be rolled into HIGHTIDE at a later date. The ICARUS<br>Transition Team estimates the current Initial Operating Capability date for the FSD to be the<br>December 2004 timeframe. Once the FSD is available, we will support it in HIGHTIDE.<br>(U//FOUO) While ICARUS should no longer be used in e-mail (as of October 2004), ICARUS<br>services will continue to operate until June 2005, to permit conversion of stored ICARUS data to<br>PKI encryption. Those concerned with the maintenance of corporate archives (collections of files<br>from various sources) that might contain ICARUS material, those with processes that employ<br>ICARUS encryption, or others with specific ICARUS-related concerns should contact the JESI<br>Trusted Communications Program Manager (<br>@nsa.ic.gov). The ICARUS Replacement<br>Plan is available at URL: <br>.<br>(U//FOUO) As a reminder, the SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE first-tier "Help Desk" transferred its<br>functions from the Customer Response Reporting Tools Branch to ITSC ('Remedy') on 24 May<br>2004. The SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE homepage ("go skywriter or "go hightide") remains on line as<br>a valuable resource for help, with links to the SKYCAST Working Aid, Policy, and FAQs.
