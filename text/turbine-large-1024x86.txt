(TS//SI//REL) A new intelligent command and control capability designed to manage a very large number of covert implants for
active SIGINT and active Attack that reside on the GENIE covert infrastructure (for endpoint data extraction). It will increase the
current capability to deploy and manage hundreds of Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CAN)
implants to potentially millions of implants.
