ROCK DRILL 5 addressed the issues resulting from an allied<br>counteroffensive deep into North Korean territory, the seizure of Pyongyang and the eventual<br>conquest/occupation of the entire North Korean landmass - Phases III and IV of OPLANS 5026<br>and 5027. While reacting to a North Korean attack (Phase II) has been the subject of a previous<br>ROCK DRILL and many exercises, ROCK DRILL 5 represented the first-ever Cryptologic<br>Community-wide discussions on the later phases of a Korean war. As such, a lot of eyes were<br>opened, assumptions challenged, myths exposed and epiphanies experienced.<br>(S//SI) Continuing in the KIMT tradition of breaking new ground with every ROCK DRILL, ROCK<br>DRILL 5 was also the first exercise of this type to be held with a Third Party partner, as the 22<br>and 23 April sessions were held at the ROK's Defense Security Agency (DSA). These sessions<br>exceeded expectations, giving DSA its first glimpse at the recently revised United Nations<br>Command/Combined Forces Command OPLANs and generating lively discussions that indicated<br>shifts in DSA's thinking about supporting the war effort. Since 95% of the troops involved in a<br>resumption of the Korean War would be South Korean, synchronizing DSA's efforts with those of<br>NSA is imperative, and ROCK DRILL 5 succeeded in starting that process.<br>(S//SI) ROCK DRILL 5 was attended by NSA/CSS participants and customers from South Korea,<br>Japan, Hawaii and Maryland. Holding the ROCK DRILL in Seoul allowed for widespread theater<br>participation and an appreciation by NSAW personnel of the challenges of the combined<br>peninsula environment. BG John DeFreitas, United States Forces Korea (USFK) J2, set the tone<br>by emphasizing the need for collaborative yet candid discussions of issues and resolutions. BG<br>DeFreitas then framed the discussions for the ROCK DRILL by detailing the Ten Critical Fights<br>that US-ROK Alliance needs to win in order to score a limited victory (as in OPLAN 5026) or<br>defeat North Korea completely (as in 5027).<br>(S//SI) Large group discussions led to smaller expert-focused groups to work on key issues in<br>the categories of Collection, IT Infrastructure/Network Security, and Analysis/Production. During<br>the DSA sessions, the small groups focused on National-Tactical Integration and Collection. From<br>both the large-group and small-group discussions, gaps were discovered and actions taken that<br>will result in improved cryptologic support for USFK, PACOM and State Department. GEN<br>LaPorte, Commander UNC/CFC/USFK, addressed the U.S.-only ROCK DRILL session and at the<br>conclusion BG DeFreitas expressed gratitude for NSA's "valuable" efforts, declaring the ROCK<br>DRILL a success.<br>(S) On the Saturday following ROCK DRILL, BG DeFreitas treated most of the participants to a<br>"Lay of the Land" tour, which acquainted those from off peninsula with the field sites and<br>command posts associated with prosecuting the North Korean target. Helicopters ferried ROCK<br>DRILLers to Third ROK Army headquarters, P'yÃ´ng t'aek (home to Field Station Korea), Osan<br>(location of the 303rd IS), and the wartime command post (CP Tango). For all, this provided a<br>revealing perspective of the cogs in the peninsula cryptologic machinery, as well as a bird's-eyeview of some of the rugged terrain on which a resumed conflict would be fought.<br>(S) The Korea IMT is now in the process of digesting the material and will soon assign NSA/CSS<br>people and organizations with follow-on actions. Those tapped for actions should be aware that<br>the tasking deadlines will be aggressive. One of the salient points of OPLANs 5026 and 5027 is<br>that the plans are defensive and USFK will be reacting to North Korean provocations - therefore,<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">NSA/CSS has to be ready to respond rapidly and on short notice.
