The daily demands of producing SIGINT eat up<br>much of our collective energy, often leaving little time for developing new approaches and ways<br>of doing business. It is for these reasons that Operation SIGINT (OpSIGINT) was created in<br>September 2001.<br>(U//FOUO) What does OpSIGINT do? We are a small team working on behalf of SID senior<br>leadership to tackle today's impediments with innovative solutions in important, target areas.<br>Our goal is to both provide immediate relief and to better position the SIGINT system for future<br>success. The team applies best business practices to this creativity and brings people together<br>from across the SIGINT Enterprise, all with the aim of collaborating to produce better SIGINT for<br>our customers. In this way, OpSIGINT supports SID's strategic goals for Transformation 2.0 and<br>Horizontal Integration.<br>(S//SI) The OpSIGINT Task Force Leads recently briefed the SID senior leadership team on our<br>activities and impact. OpSIGINT Task Forces are currently addressing specific mission gaps<br>associated with the North Korea and Iraq/Counterterrorism targets and are providing support to<br>the Issue Management Teams on a number of strategic fronts. SID leadership is pleased with<br>how these efforts are going, and has reaffirmed its commitment to the OpSIGINT effort.<br>(U//FOUO) OpSIGINT will kick off a comprehensive recruitment effort in early summer to replace<br>departing OpSIGINT detailees and to address new SIGINT challenges. I encourage everyone in<br>SID to consider taking advantage of this career-broadening, eye-opening opportunity to work in<br>a stimulating environment in which new ideas are encouraged and the opportunity exists to<br>learn from some tremendous SIGINT professionals.
