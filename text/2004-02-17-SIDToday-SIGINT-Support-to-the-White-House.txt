On a daily basis SIGINT reaches President Bush in<br>the President's Terrorist Threat Report; presented by his national security advisor; summarized<br>by the Situation Room staff in their twice-a-day, one-page President's Summary; directly, in the<br>form of the President's Daily Briefing (PDB), or indirectly, woven into PDB all-source articles and<br>separate SIGINT reports presented by the PDB briefer.<br>(S) In addition to the President, a number of high level White House officials and National<br>Security Council (NSC) staff members also receive and use SIGINT as they formulate and<br>coordinate national security policy. These include Vice President Cheney, Assistant to the<br>President for National Security Affairs Condoleezza Rice (the "National Security Advisor"),<br>Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Stephen Hadley, White House<br>Chief of Staff Andrew Card, Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor to the Vice President I.<br>Lewis Libby, about eighty special assistants to the President (senior directors) and directors on<br>the NSC staff, national security assistants and advisors to the Vice President, and a few others.<br>(S//SI) Feedback from the White House shows that SIGINT makes profound contributions to<br>their work and decisions. Some examples:<br>the text of a presidential speech to a large foreign audience was altered a few days<br>before it was delivered due to SIGINT reporting;<br>SIGINT about a foreign government was so timely and important that two NSC special<br>assistants to the President immediately took it to the National Security Advisor, who read<br>it and right away walked it directly into the Oval Office to discuss it with the President;<br>SIGINT alerted an NSC official of a foreign representative's intentions to call him that<br>afternoon and the subject of the call, therefore helping him to prepare;<br>the National Security Advisor used SIGINT to prepare the President for a visit by a head<br>of state;<br>during his daily intelligence briefing (the PDB), the President read a 3-page SIGINT<br>summary report regarding terrorism in its entirety.<br>Our work at NSA impacts the highest levels of our national government, on a daily basis<br>affecting their work, actions and decisions. As the Special Assistant to the President and Senior<br>Director for Near East and North African Affairs, Ambassador Elliott Abrams told two of his<br>directors who were preparing to visit NSA one day last year, "Tell NSA that we love them!"<br>(U) How does SIGINT get to the top?<br>(S) The White House Situation Room (WHSR) is critical to ensuring that our SIGINT reports (and<br>a great variety of other kinds of information) are disseminated to the appropriate officials at the<br>White House. All SIGINT addressed to the White House arrives electronically in the Situation<br>Room, which is located on the ground floor of the West Wing. Three duty officers scan each<br>incoming item (be it SIGINT or another source), determine who needs to see it, and disseminate<br>the item accordingly, sometimes adding a very short summary or background information.<br>Across West Executive Avenue from the West Wing, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building,<br>NSC staff members can access the SIGINT at their workstations. Items for the National Security<br>Advisor and other West Wing officials are placed in their read folders that are kept in the Sit<br>Room or sent electronically to their executive assistants.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(S) Duty officers in the Sit Room, two of whom are NSAers, often include SIGINT in the twice-aday WHSR President's Summary. Also, the WHSR senior intelligence officer (a position that since<br>its inception has been held by an NSAer, currently<br>) forwards select NSA tippers and<br>other SIGINT reports, along with a short summary highlighting the reports' importance, to NSC<br>senior directors and others based on their expressed intelligence needs.<br>(U) Interactions between the SID and the White House take place virtually every day, among<br>NSC staffers, SIGINT National Intelligence Officers (SINIOs), NSOC, experts from several target<br>offices in Analysis and Production, the SID senior executive account manager (SEAM), the<br>account manager, the Sit Room senior intelligence analyst, and the deputy director of the Sit<br>Room<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on SIGINT and the White House, contact Customer Gateway's<br>While House Account Manager, <br>, <br> or visit the White House support<br>website .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
