The exploding popularity of<br>wireless communications has resulted in a high volume of packet data that often seems<br>impossible to process. DRAGONVIEW was developed to meet this challenge, and gives analysts a<br>powerful new way to look at their targets and process packet data more quickly.<br>(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW is a visualization tool developed within Tailored Access Operations'<br>(TAOs') Hardware Bridging Office (HBO). DRAGONVIEW is currently used to analyze wireless<br>network data collected from several SIGINT collection systems targeted at the various flavors of<br>802.11 traffic. The tool will currently display data to show both logical and physical aspects of<br>the data collected during surveys.<br>(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW can process SIGINT data collected from systems BEECOASTAL, OMINA,<br>VINEYARD, FLOODSCOPE, and MOONSHINE.<br>(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW is a stand-alone application used to process survey collection data. In<br>addition to supporting the formats from the SIGINT collectors listed above, DRAGONVIEW can<br>also process tcpdump and files generated by COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) products such as<br>AiroPeek. DRAGONVIEW also has its own native format called DRAGONVIEW File Format (DFF).<br>(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW uses RENOIR and GraphViz to display logical network diagrams. If GPS<br>coordinate data is recorded by the collection system, OpenMap is used to display the survey<br>device's drive path.<br>(C) Watch our DRAGONVIEW video by clicking the following link:<br>. <br>IMPORTANT : Use Netscape Navigator to view the video (some versions of Internet Explorer do<br>not render the video properly), and ensure your speakers are turned on and the volume is<br>turned up.<br>(C) For more information on DRAGONVIEW, go to the DRAGONVIEW web page ("go<br>dragonview") or contact <br> <br>, <br>.
