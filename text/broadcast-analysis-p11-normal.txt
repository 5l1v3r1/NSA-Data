6.1	An analysis was performed on the data in order to see the most popular radio stations
in a given country. The following data was obtained:

Country	IP Address	Radio Station
Iran	190.144.31.82	http://www.radiocomunicate.com
Pakistan	174.36.19.83	http://www.cricbuzz.com/
Russia	212.1.226.163	M2 Radio www.m2radio.fr
China	91.121.65.213	http://www.radio-dzair.com

Zimbabwe	78.157.192.113	www.zeilsteen .com
United Kingdom	88.191.13.53	www.hotmixradio.fr

6.2	Different countries exhibit different behaviours at this level. The top radio stations in
Russia and UK are music and entertainment based stations. The top radio station in
Iraq appears to be for a Saudi based action group to free prisoners in Iraq.

6.3	It is worth noting that the top radio station in China is a French language Algerian
radio station. This is possibly due to inaccuracies in the GEOFUSION dataset or an
motivated and interested community in China.
