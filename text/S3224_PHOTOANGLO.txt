•Maximum Output Power: 2 W
•Output:

•Video

•Transmit antenna
•Inputs:

•External oscillator
•Receive antenna

(U) Concept of Operation

(TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) TS//SI//REL TO USA,FVEY) The radar unit
generates an un-modulated, continuous wave (CW) signal. The oscillator is
either generated internally, or externally through a signal generator or cavity
oscillator. The unit amplifies the signal and sends it out to an RF connector,
where it is directed to some form of transmission antenna (horn, parabolic dish,
LPA, spiral). The signal illuminates the target system and is re-radiated. The
receive antenna picks up the re-radiated signal and directs the signal to the
receive input. The signal is amplified, filtered, and mixed with the transmit
antenna. The result is a homodyne receiver in which the RF signal is mixed
directly to baseband. The baseband video signal is ported to an external BNC
connector. This connects to a processing system, such as NIGHTWATCH, an
LFS-2, or VIEWPLATE, to process the signal and provide the intelligence.

Unit Cost: $40k (planned)

Status: Development. Planned IOC is 1st QTR FY09.
