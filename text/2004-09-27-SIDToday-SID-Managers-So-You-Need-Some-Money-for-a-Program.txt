DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) SID Managers: So, You Need Some Money for a Program?<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 09/27/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) As the new fiscal year approaches many programs face shortfalls either closing out<br>the fiscal year or entering the new one. Other needs arise independent of the calendar. SID<br>Planning wants you to know that there is a mature process in place for vetting and approving<br>unfunded requests and for identifying the sources of funding to pay for them.<br>(U//FOUO) First, you should know that we are not authorized to have a "reserve," or special pot<br>of money, to fund our shortfalls. That means that either ongoing activities must be reduced if<br>SID accepts a request for funding, or the request must be forwarded to the NSA corporation -but SID has had limited success with this latter approach. Second, MG Quirk has delegated all<br>fiduciary responsibility and resources to the deputy directorates. Therefore, on behalf of MG<br>Quirk, SID Planning conducts the unfunded request (UFR) process for the benefit of the<br>deputy directorates.<br>Here is how it works:<br>(U//FOUO) Anyone can identify a shortfall, but only designated representatives from S0, S1, S2,<br>or S3 are able to validate the shortfall and submit it for inclusion on the UFR list. The reps for<br>S0, S1, S2, and S3 are, currently, <br> <br> Jeff Krause, and <br>,<br>respectively. These individuals have a template they must fill out that captures essential<br>information for decision makers about the shortfall, such as the usual identifying information as<br>well as what the money is for and what difference it will make to performance of the program or<br>of SID. The project name is needed, as well as cost center information, type of appropriation<br>needed, amounts, and the status of the request.<br>(U//FOUO) Once this information is complete they can submit the UFR for the list. DF52 &amp; S01X<br>maintain the list. However, if the deputy directorate to which the shortfall is submitted<br>determines that the shortfall is not valid (for any reason), or that they are able to address the<br>need from within the organization, then the item is not eligible for the UFR list.<br>(U//FOUO) At various times during the fiscal year, and more often at times of special need or<br>interest, the above individuals get together under the auspices of SID Planning to "scrub" the<br>list again - getting additional and updated data as needed. Then, they prioritize the list based on<br>urgency and merit. Once the total bill is identified, they have a set of business rules to identify<br>the potential sources of funds within SID for the set of items to be funded on the UFR list. If the<br>sources are deemed to be more valuable than any UFR items, then those items ultimately are<br>not funded. Because sources usually entail a direct and certain cut to level of effort in ongoing<br>programs, there is an incentive to address UFRs no earlier than when the need is pressing.<br>(U//FOUO) Soon thereafter, the list of approved UFRs, and the sources to pay for them, are<br>forwarded to the Senior Working Group (SWG), currently consisting of <br> (DF52), Len<br>Reinsfelder (S1), <br> (S2), Jim Cusick (S3), <br> (S0), Dave Hurry (TD) and<br>chaired by<br>. The SWG makes resource decisions on behalf of leadership<br>using business rules. The SWG can also send a UFR back for further work. Decisions are made<br>by consensus and considered binding on all parties. Immediately after decisions are made, DF52<br>develops change sheets for entry into SEACPS.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have questions on the UFR process, please contact<br>(<br>), <br>).<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
