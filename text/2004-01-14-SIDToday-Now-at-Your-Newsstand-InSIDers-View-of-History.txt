In it,<br>contributors will tell of experiences from their careers in which they were caught up in historical<br>events. These might be stories from people who witnessed major incidents unfold; other times<br>they may be less momentous in nature (such as a story about running into a VIP in an<br>unexpected place). We hope that this series will become a permanent feature of the webpage.<br>(U//FOUO) Were you working shiftwork one night when you had to handle a brewing<br>international crisis? Did you once brief a VIP on a critical piece of intelligence? Did you serve in<br>the military and see an exceptional event take place? -- These are examples of potential stories.<br>Many in SID must have interesting anecdotes along these lines. (Amusing stories would be very<br>welcome!) We invite you to submit your story via our "submit an item" function on the<br>right side of the SID today homepage .<br>(U//FOUO) To get the ball rolling, we have asked the SID senior leadership to think back on their<br>long careers for such stories, and we expect to publish these in the coming weeks. Today's<br>article from Charles Berlin is the first.
