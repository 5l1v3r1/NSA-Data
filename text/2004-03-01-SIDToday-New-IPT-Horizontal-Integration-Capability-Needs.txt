As the Director and Deputy Director have said, "It is not about the need to<br>know, but rather the need to share." The intellectual capital of the "analytic community" here at<br>NSA is as valuable as the SIGINT we produce, but its true value is only realized when it is<br>shared. To facilitate sharing -- be it raw data, analytic knowledge, or finished SIGINT -- we must<br>provide the necessary tools and policy framework.<br>(U//FOUO) The Horizontal Integration Capability Needs IPT will first gather the FY06 budget<br>pieces, which will quantify our near-term capabilities. It will do this by mid-March. Next it will<br>look to the future and how to get there. The IPT will develop operational scenarios that will put<br>the ideas of integration and sharing up against potential real world events. These scenarios will<br>have policy, legal, and cultural/people issues woven into them. Concurrent with the scenario<br>development is the development of a Transformation 2.0 CONOP and integrated systems<br>architecture.<br>(U//FOUO) Once they are completed, the IPT will use the CONOP, architecture, and mission<br>scenarios to perform a functional needs analysis that will expose the gaps in our ability to<br>collaborate and share. As we analyze our capabilities and needs, we will also work with internal<br>and external developmental efforts already underway. The IPT will bound our current<br>capabilities, define gaps in those capabilities, state the requirements to close our gaps, and<br>quantify what we will need to get to our desired goal. These efforts are key pieces to getting to<br>the next level of technological enablers to fulfill our "need to share." The team will finish the<br>analysis necessary to define the "to be" state of Horizontal Integration by mid-July, incorporate<br>vetted feedback, and submit a roll-out plan to the NSA Horizontal Integration Steering Group,<br>chaired by Mr. Jim Allen, by late August.<br>(U//FOUO) Members of the IPT are:<br> (S2) - Chair,<br>Russ Berkoff (DC4) - Deputy Chair,<br>Scott Thayer (S2) - Mentor,<br> (S01A);<br>Dr. Eric Haseltine (RAD);<br> (I),<br>(AB4),<br> (SDN),<br>April Doss (DC31),<br>(DK09),<br> (D21),<br> (DF),<br> (I11),<br> (RAD), and<br>(I11).<br>(U//FOUO) For more information or questions on this initiative, please contact<br>Horizontal Integration IPT Executive Secretary, <br>, or Scott Thayer, Horizontal<br>Integration IPT Mentor, <br>.<br><br> </p>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: For some background information on this and<br>other IPT's, see the related message from Jim Allen , SID Deputy Director for A&amp;P (S2).<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
