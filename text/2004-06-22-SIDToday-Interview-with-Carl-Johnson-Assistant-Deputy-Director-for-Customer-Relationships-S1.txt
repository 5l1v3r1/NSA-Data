Carl Johnson, Assistant Deputy Director<br>for Customer Relationships (S1)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/22/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>Unknown <br>(U//FOUO) Here's another in our series of interviews with SID leaders. Today's interview is with<br>Carl Johnson of the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD, S1)<br>What was your first job at the Agency?<br>(S//SI) My first job at NSA, May 1976, was as an Air Force Traffic Analyst. I was part of a team<br>hand-picked by General Ardisana to update the technical health of the primary threat - USSR.<br>The project was called "PULSEBEAT" and I was personally responsible for updating Soviet Long<br>Range Aviation and Airborne Command Post TEXTA.<br>(S//SI) I was assigned to A62 wherein I applied knowledge learned on my previous assignment<br>as a Soviet Radioprinter Analyst in Misawa, Japan. These were exciting times, mainly because<br>the Soviet Union was our most immediate threat and A Group was the biggest target effort at<br>NSA. This was a great way to be introduced to NSA and to get "knee deep" in traffic analytic<br>technical learning.<br>What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(S//SI) Managing the EP-3 Crisis (emergency landing of the US Navy EP-3E reconnaissance<br>aircraft on China's Hainan Island) while Chief of the China and Korea Product Line. My most<br>important concern was getting our air crew out of China safely and quickly. A huge bonus would<br>be getting the aircraft returned to the U.S. but that was ancillary to freeing our crew. When that<br>crew was released, I breathed a big sigh of relief. When they walked into my office at NSA, I was<br>very near tears looking at how young they were -- truly a highlight of my career!<br>What is the biggest challenge facing your organization right now?<br>(U//FOUO) Making CRD a full partner within the SID construct. We (CRD) view our business as a<br>vital and integral part of the SIGINT production continuum. CRD is the focal point of much of the<br>day-to-day interactions with our customers, but all of us in SID are in the fight together. We are<br>working hard to emphasize and reinforce how the collective efforts of all of us in SID -- together<br>with those of the IAD -- support the SIGINT and national defense missions. We all must share<br>more broadly, perform analysis and report faster-yet-precisely, and work against our highest<br>priorities. It takes the full SID complement to make us successful and a failure by any part<br>could lead to the collapse of any other part.<br>What is the most exciting project for the future that your org is currently undertaking?<br>(S//SI) CRD is the leading edge of SIGINT. We work to understand clients and to ensure their<br>satisfaction. We have projects underway to make both the clients and our fellow co-producers<br>understand the total picture better. JOURNEYMAN aims to assist analysts and reporters perform<br>their jobs better and more efficiently. IN Matcher will save our work force time by automating IN<br>selection. Tool developments will further enhance reporting capability and will help analysts/<br>reporters/ linguists write better products. New products and services will be more futuristic to<br>meet transformation goals and client needs. As we disperse mission to gain efficiencies and for<br>better mission assurance, the DSOC model is instructive on how CRD will engage customers.<br>New policies that are aggressive and progressive are being written. We're providing support to<br>troops and crises in unprecedented ways, to include having over 100 NSA persons in harm's<br>way. These are exciting times and CRD is out front for SID.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) See other interviews in this series:<br>Interview With...
