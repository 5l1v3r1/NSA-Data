Questions like:<br>Is this image in my traffic a warhead, or a newfangled blender?<br>Is this really a beer fermenter, or some sort of dual-use technology?<br>Do you have any information that would support our theory that this charitable<br>organization is a front for terrorism?<br>(S//SI) NSA analysts have long recognized the need to proactively collaborate with Intelligence<br>Community (IC) partners in order to improve intelligence. These same analysts, who have in the<br>past found creative and effective ways to partner, are now meeting the challenge of<br>implementing the Director's Transformation 2.0. With new, easy-to-follow instructions (see<br>Information Sharing Card --"go infoshare"), partnering through information sharing and analytic<br>collaboration is now becoming the norm, not the exception. We would like to share a few<br>"success stories" with you:<br>(S//SI) Analysts from China and Korea Product Line posted information for counterparts<br>at Department of Energy (DOE) in a common analytic space. The traffic only had a nondescript title and a curve. Instead of not reporting the traffic or putting out a report that<br>says, "here's an unidentified curve," the partners, working together, were able to<br>determine that Chinese nuclear warhead designers were building an anechoic* chamber.<br>The DOE partner further clarified that "the frequency of interest is 8.15 GHz where the<br>attenuation is the strongest. The pyramidal reference indicates the 'pyramids' on the wall<br>of the chamber and the material is some microwave-absorbing material. I have attached<br>a copy of the famous anechoic chamber for your reference."<br>Just what you were thinking, right?<br>(S//SI) A CIA Counterterrorist Center (CTC) analyst was investigating a newly-formed<br>Iraqi company. Her searches of open source and classified databases yielded no<br>information. NSA analysts from Counterterrorism (S2I) and Proliferation and Arms<br>Control (S2G) were aware of "promotional" information about the company. Having the<br>background info was a tremendous time saver for CIA. The NSA and CIA analysts are<br>working together now to determine if the company is supporting terrorism in Iraq; when<br>they come up with an analytic conclusion, they will report.<br>(S//SI) Recent HUMINT reporting shed light on an entity mentioned in a transcript from<br>December 2003. Analysts in the Regional Targets Product Line (S2A) thought that the<br>2003 information could possibly give insight into support to the Taliban from Middle<br>Eastern countries. NSA and CIA analysts now have an open line of communication and<br>are working closely to understand the issues related to this important topic.<br>(U//FOUO) These are impressive examples and a good beginning. We are striving to make<br>collaboration an integral part of the job for NSA analysts by improving collaborative tools, policy<br>and processes. We invite you to visit our website at<br>for to learn more about<br>collaboration and information sharing. On that page you will find a "collaboration record" that<br>you can use to easily document your interaction with your counterparts.
