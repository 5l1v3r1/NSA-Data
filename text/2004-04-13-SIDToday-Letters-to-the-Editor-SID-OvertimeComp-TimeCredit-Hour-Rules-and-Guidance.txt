Good to see the problem addressed.<br>(U) I see many NSAers trying to do a good job, but there is just not enough time in the<br>workday. Often, their only choice is to work past the normal workday. The alternative is to not<br>do the work. Good time management can only do so much.<br>(U) Guidance about comp and overtime is helpful, but management must address work loads<br>and in some cases not assign more than can be done in the time avaliable. We are often left<br>with doing ten things poorly instead of doing six things well.<br>From:<br><br>(<br><br>(U) Well done and long overdue! I was glad to see Agency leadership support from the top. Now<br>it needs to filter down. I know of too many offices where they work overtime/comp to justify the<br>need for additional people and then can't use the hours and don't get the people. This should<br>not be the answer to justifying a need for additional bodies.<br>(U) We need to develop separate mechanisms to justify manpower needs without further<br>stressing us in this area. It is hard when the managers force this on people, as I found is the<br>case in so many areas. And the sad thing is that employees think that it will get them a<br>promo/award, and it doesn't. And often it just shows you can't get your work done within<br>prescribed time limits.<br>(U) Perhaps we need more classes in time management and fewer unproductive meetings to<br>provide people with the skills and opportunity to do their jobs.<br>From:<br><br>)<br><br>(U) Kudos to <br>nd SID for putting together a communication that conveyed caring and<br>concern for the SID workforce, sound advice to SID's management, as well as accuracy in<br>presenting "policy correct" guidance that everyone can follow.
