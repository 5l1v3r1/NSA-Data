Continued effort against the South Pacific region - GCSB s access development
activities will be focused on the South Pacific region and entail close partnering and
engagement with DSD, NZSIS and AS1S. This is seen as a continuing high priority iwssuc
given the increasing rollout of cable in the South Pacific region

Auditing issue —indicated that 20% of GCSB’s analytic workforce does not have
accounts or access to key NSA databases. This is a particularly significant issue for
GCSB as they provide NSA with NZL data which they have traditionally accessed via
NSA tool/database interfaces (ie. GCSB analysts are unable to query or access NZL
data). GCSB are also working to gain connectivity to DSD XKEYSCORE (as a first step
towards connecting to other 2P XKs)
