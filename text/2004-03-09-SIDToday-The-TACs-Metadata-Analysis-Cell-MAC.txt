DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) The TAC's Metadata Analysis Cell (MAC)<br>FROM:<br>Technical Director, MAC<br>Run Date: 03/09/2004<br>FROM: <br>Technical Director, MAC <br>(TS//SI) Let's start with an example of how work in the Metadata<br>Analysis Cell (MAC) leads to intelligence results:<br>(TS//SI) MAC Training on MAINWAY Uncovers New CT Leads :<br>Training on a suite of MAINWAY tools assisted the CT SIGDEV effort<br>to discover new high value terrorist-related targets.<br>(TS//SI) In mid-May, MAC analysts briefed the CT Analyst<br>Workshop for telephony on the MAINWAY suite of tools. One month<br>later, a CT analyst who had attended the workshop approached the<br>MAC for assistance in finding new terrorist-related numbers.<br>(TS//SI) The MAC worked with the CT analyst to apply the MAST<br>Cohort and Community of Interest searches. This collaboration<br>uncovered six new terrorist-related numbers that will be included<br>in a technical report. Concurrently, the CT analyst used the SIGINT<br>Navigator's TIMELINE application to track how terrorist-related<br>numbers changed over time as recent events unfolded in Saudi<br>Arabia.<br>(TS//SI) What does the Metadata Analysis Cell do? It is capable of<br>tracking and documenting the communications environment using<br>communications externals. In this process, the MAC works closely<br>with the Network Analysis Center (NAC) and Product Lines to build<br>a deeper understanding of the worldwide metadata that supports<br>Product Line collection, processing, analysis, reporting, and<br>development efforts.<br>(TS//SI) The MAC combines its results with all-source information<br>in search of new targets and identifiers, and for metadata<br>information that ties known identifiers to specific individuals or<br>organizations. It tracks these identifiers to ensure they are tasked<br>through OCTAVE and other collection systems. It develops target<br>communications networks and patterns of activity with a goal of<br>discovering previously unknown communications of interest.<br>(TS//SI) While currently focusing efforts on the counterterrorism<br>problem, the MAC workforce is capable of quickly moving to other<br>targets as priorities change. The MAC has demonstrated success<br>against INMARSAT, GSM and other mobile handsets, PSTN,<br>facsimile, DNI and other modes of communications.<br>(TS//SI) The MAC is a leader in contact chaining procedures,<br>results analysis, and reporting. While the focal point for contact<br>chaining analysis at NSA, the MAC has been very successful in<br>introducing fast and innovative tools into the mainstream at NSA<br>Headquarters and the extended enterprise. For example, there are<br>now over 3,000 users of the SIGINT NAVIGATOR/MAINWAY suite<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SIGINT Development <br>1.  SIGINT<br>Development: A<br>Network of Discovery<br>Networks<br>2.  Target Technology<br>Trends<br>3.  SIGINT<br>Development: the<br>Target Analysis<br>Center (TAC)<br>4.  The TAC's Metadata<br>Analysis Cell (MAC)<br>5.  The TAC's Social<br>Network Analysis<br>Workcenter (SNAW)<br>6.  TAC's Target<br>Development<br>Services (TDS): In<br>the Spotlight and<br>Behind the Scenes<br>7.  The NAC's Advanced<br>Network<br>Development &amp;<br>Analysis (ANDA)<br>Division<br>8.  The NAC's<br>Data/Network<br>Operations Center<br>(DNOC)<br><br> </p>for call chaining analysis. Numerous civilian and military analysts<br>were rapidly trained in its use prior to the war with Iraq.<br>(TS//SI) In addition to the suite, a number of routines, shared with<br>the product lines, were developed in conjunction with the Math<br>Research Group. These routines alert analysts to telephony and<br>DNI communications activity and follow complex communications<br>routing. The MAC developed an extensive process that supports<br>contact chaining and reporting by other SIGINT producers.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
