From Wikiinfo

(TS//SI//REL) VALIANTSURF is the coverterm for the development of Data Network Cipher (DNC)
exploitation capabilities in TURMOIL for integration into the TURBULENCE DNC thread. VALIANTSURF is
the preferred reference for all TURBULENCE DNC exploitation capabilities since the fact that NSA does
work with DNC's is classified "S//REL". The TURBULENCE DNC capability exploits communications
encrypted with DNC Internet Protocols.

■	im/FOUm CLASSIFICATION G1T1DF FOR ECI PICARESQUE (P1Q) 02-10 (I

(U) Guidelines

■	(U//FOUO) The fact that NSA is interested in DNC is U//FOUO.

■	(S//REL) Just the fact that NSA does work with DNC is classified.

■	(S//REL) If the only information given is that you are a DNC expert or you work on DNCs, then the classification is
S//REL

■	(TS//S1//ORCON/REL) If the information given is that you decrypt DNCs, the classification is, at a minimum TS//SI
//ORCON//REL

■	(TS//S1//ORCON/REL) If the fact of DNC exploitation is mentioned or inferred (with or without mention of a specific
target or person), the classification is TS//SI//ORCON//REL

■	(TS//S1//ORCON/REL) The decryption results are classified, at a minimum, TS//SI//REL

(TS//SI//ORCON/REL) The classifications above are the minimum classifications. A higher classification may be required
depending on the rest of the content. For example, mentioning you work on DNCs is SECRET//REL but if you mention you work
on DNCs and are in CES, the classification should be TS//SI//ORCON//REL since CES deals with exploitation.

(U) DNC Protocols

(U) IPsec

(U) The IPsec DNC protocol suite comprises the following protocols:

■	(U) ISAKMP - Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (RFC 2407, RFC 2408)
provides an authentication and key exchange framework.

■	(U) IKE - Internet Key Exchange vl(RFC 2409) and v2(RFC 4306) provide an authentication and
key exchange mechanism.

■	(U) ESP - Encapsulating Security Payload (RFC 2406) provides traffic confidentiality (via encryption)
provides authentication and integrity protection.

■	(U) AH - Authentication Header (RFC 2402) provides integrity and authentication protection the includes immutable IP
header fields. This differs from ESP integrity protection that does not include the IP header.

(U) PPTP

(U) The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) was developed in 1996 by the PPTP Forum, comprised of Ascend
Communications, U.S. Robotics, 3Com, Copper Mountain Networks, ECI Telematics, and lead by Microsoft.

(U) The Microsoft implementation of PPTP (RFC 2637) permits the data link layer protocol, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) (see
STD-0051), to be tunneled through an IP network, encapsulated within an enhanced/modified Generic Routing Encapsulation
(GRE) transport protocol (IP Next Protocol 4 7). The contents of the PPP data is normally IP network protocol packets for a
private network, but can also carry any other Local Area Network (LAN) protocol, like Microsoft NetBEUI or Novell IPX/SPX.

(U) Microsoft PPTP (MS-PPTP) permits the encapsulated PPP data to be authenticated using either version 1 (RFC 2433) or
version 2 (RFC 2759) of the Microsoft extensions to the PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) (RFC 1994),
and to be encrypted using RC4 with key lengths of 40, 56, or 128 bits (RFC 3078, RFC 3079). The mode of the encryption is
negotiated and key lengths are exchanged using the PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) (RFC 1962).

(U) HOOKED

(TS//SI//REL) HOOKED HAND is a DNC protocol used in a commercial DNC product.

(U) CINDER

(TS//SI//REL) CINDERASH/TRACK are ESP-like protocols that use non-RFC defined fields.

(U) TU DNC Products

(S//SI//REL) IPSec DNC Products

(S//SI//REL) The TU DNC products are the outputs of four processing data flows:

■	(S//SI//REL) The TU DNC Metadata flow collects metadata about IPsec (IKE/ISAKMP and ESP) events then forwards the
metadata to follow-on SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) systems.

■	(TS//SI//REL) The TU DNC Decryption flow detects IPsec communications, selects by IP-Address, decrypts the traffic
selected for decryption, and re-injects the encapsulated (cleartext) content into TUFIMOIL for processing.

VAL IANT S URF - Wikiinfo

■	(TS//SI//REL) The TU DNC Survey flow forwards to
XKEYSCORE all encapsulated (cleartext) sessions that are
selected by IP-Address for decryption by the TU DNC
Decryption flow that are also marked for SIGDEV.

■	(S//SI//REL) The DNC Analyze flow selects by IP-Address
IKE/1SAKMP and ESP packets that are then sessionized
and forwarded to PRESSUREWAVE for analysis.

(U) Spin History

(TS//SI//REL) Spin 9 efforts transitioned fielded DNC software
from the Red TURMOIL (TML) architecture to the Blue and
implemented a redesign of the decryption flow that reallocates
some functionality between TURMOIL and the DNC Attack
Orchestrator (VAO).

(TS//SI//REL) Spin 10 efforts started development of a
decryption capability that can be deployed to SMK, improved
DNC detection and processing capabilities, and developed the
DNC Analyze flow.

(S//SI//REL) DNC Metadata Flow

■	(TS//SI//ORCON//REL) The DNC Metadata Flow collects metadata about IKE/ISAKMP and AH/ESP events and forwards the
metadata to follow-on SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) systems.

■	(TS//SI//ORCON//REL) All IKE/ISAKMP packets seen in the incoming data are collected, bundled and then sessionized
within TURMOIL. Then the metadata is extracted, converted to ASDF and then sent to the ASDFReporter component within
TURMOIL. The ASDFReporter gathers all ASDF generated within TURMOIL and sends the bundles to FALLOUT via TUBE.
FALLOUT delivers the metadata records to the appropriate destinations. The IPSec IKE metadata all goes to TOYGRIPPE via
MAILORDER. TOYGRIPPE is a DNC analytic database in CES used by the cryptanalysts in conjunction with a vulnerability
database to determine exploitability.

■ (TS//SI//ORCON//REL) Sampled AH/ESP packets seen in the incoming data are collected, metadata is extracted per session,
and the metadata is converted to ASDF and sent to the ASDFReporter within TURMOIL. The ASDF records follow the same
paths as the IKE Metadata above.

(TS//SI//ORCON//REL) DNC Decryption Flow

■ (TS//SI//ORCON//REL) The DNC Decryption Flow detects and decrypts selected communications that are encrypted using
IPsec then reinjects the unencrypted packets back into TURMOIL Stage 1. TURMOIL Stage 1 applications process the
packets into sessions and when appropriate forwards the unencrypted content to follow-on processing systems. The DNC
eventing (PPF) components in TURMOIL detect all IKE/ISAKMP and ESP packets and queries KEYCARD for each unique
IKE exchange session and each unique ESP session to determine if the link should be selected for processing. Selection is
based on IP address. Decryption is attempted if either the source or the destination IP address is targeted for decryption in
KEYCARD (the KEYCARD tasking action is labeled "TRANSFORM" so as not to use the term "decrypt"). If KEYCARD returns
a hit for an IKE packet, then the IKE packet is sent to LONGHAUL where is is used to recover keys. If KEYCARD returns a
hit for an ESP packet, a key request is sent to LONGHAUL. The IPsec Security Parameter index (SP1) correlates IKE

VALIANTSURF - Wikiinfo

sessions with ESP sessions. A LONGHAUL response message will either return the key or indicate that a key could not be
recovered. If a key is recovered, the ESP packets are decrypted and re-injected into TURMOIL for further processing.

■ (TS//SI//ORCON//REL) All DNC Decryption functions and communications with LONGHAUL, specifically POISONNUT, the
Attack Orchestrator (and a DNC Metrics service via POISONNUT) are hosted on a specially configured and dedicated
TURMOIL processing host called a CA Server. All CA Service blade software is loaded and administered by CES approved
and CA Services authorized administrators. The CA server is firewalled and effectively functions as an extension of the CES
enclave. In the future all communications between the CA Server and the CES services (LONGHAUL, DNC Metrics) will be
a secure JMS messaging service based on the ISLANDTRANSPORT / 1SLANDHIDEAWAY infrastructure.

(TS//SI//REL) DNC Survey Flow

■	(TS//SI//REL) The DNC Survey Flow detects, decrypts selected communications that are encrypted using IPsec; then
sessionizes the unencrypted packets and sends the sessions to XKEYSCORE. The DNC eventing (PPF) components in
TURMOIL detects all IKE/ISAKMP and ESP packets and queries KEYCARD for each unique IKE exchange session and each
unique ESP session to determine if the link should be selected for processing. Tasking is based on IP address. Decryption is
attempted if either the source or the destination IP address is tasked for decryption in KEYCARD (the KEYCARD tasking
action is labelled "TRANSFORM" so as not to use the term "decrypt"). If KEYCARD returns a hit for an IKE packet, then the
IKE packet is sent to the POISONNUT(DNC Attack Orchestration) Service. If KEYCARD returns a hit for an ESP packet, a
key request is sent to POISONNUT. A POISONNUT response message will either return the key or indicate that a key could
not be recovered. If a key is recovered, the ESP packets are decrypted and re-injected into TURMOIL for sessionization. If
KEYCARD also associated a "SURVEY" action with the DNC Tunnel IP-Address the encapsulated sessions are sent to
XKEYSCORE. The DNC Survey flow requires that both "TRANSFORM" and "SURVEY" actions are assigned to a targeted
IP-Address.

■	(TS//SI//REL) All DNC Decryption functions and communications with POISONNUTfand a DNC Metrics service) are hosted
on a specially configured TURMOIL processor called a CA Server. All CA Server software is loaded and administered by CES
approved and CA Server authorized administrators. The CA Server is firewalled and effectively functions as an extension of

missing transforms(see MadForge DNC-analytic project for details).

■	(S) Added capability to process Toygrippe file classification determined by DNC Metadata.

■	(S) Spin 12 - The VPN Analytic has been re-named as the VIAS (VPN IKE Analytic Service). In this spin, there were 2 major
changes.

■	(S) First, the analytic was converted to run in the Metrotube 2 framework, as a JSorcerer Service on the Metrotube
Service Bus.

■	(S) Second, the VIAS is now released by the ValiantSurf (DNC) team directly to Turbulence, where Spin 11 and earlier
versions were packaged by the DNC team, delivered informally to Metrotube Services who performed the software
release to Turbulence.

■	(S) Spin 11 and prior - VPN Analytic runs as a Metrotube 1 service.

1.	Power/space/cooling limitations

2.	Long lead time to gain approval to add CA Services servers

3.	Hardware cost

4.	Limits on public IP address space at some sites
