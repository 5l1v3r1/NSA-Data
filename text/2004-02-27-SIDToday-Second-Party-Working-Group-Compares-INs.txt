The next step, as set forth in the 5-Eyes Business Vision, is for the Second Parties<br>to capitalize on opportunities to act together against global threats as they emerge. To be<br>successful, we must share Intelligence Needs (INs) to the greatest extent possible within the<br>Second Party community. This sharing supports both the strategic goals of satisfying client<br>needs and creating a "default to share" approach in our relationships.<br>(C) With this background, Customer Gateway (S11) recently brought together representatives of<br>each of the Second Party nations to form a Second Party INs Working Group. They reviewed a<br>number of aspects of information needs processes, including the activities of the "Customer INs<br>and Response" Integrated Product Team (IPT), which is reexamining how NSA gathers,<br>manages, and responds to the needs of our customers. The similarities and differences between<br>each of the partners and their related processes led to discussion that focused on the sharing of<br>priorities and mission - rather than individual - INs.<br>(C) Key outcomes of the meeting were agreements that:<br>1.  Sharing INs at the highest level only is desirable at this time.<br>2.  The process of sharing INs and closing intelligence gaps should be agreed upon before<br>significant investment is made in technology.<br>3.  A common IN structure is necessary.<br>4.  Individual bilateral commitments to share INs on specific topics would be honored as we<br>progress toward creating a space each Second Party can populate with high-priority INs.<br>5.  The working group will brief the status of their work at the Second Party Customer<br>Service Conference in April.<br>(U//FOUO) More information, see the 5-Eyes Business Vision briefing on the SIGINT Planning,<br>Programming and Execution (S01X) web site.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
