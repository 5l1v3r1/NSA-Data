Is My Selector Tasked for
QUANTUM?

If you sent your R&T analyst a selector to task for
QUANTUMTHEORY and you want to see if it has been tasked yet,
you can enter the selector in Target Profiler and if you see "tasked
for survey" and the Technique to be QUANTUMTHEORY or
QUANTUMNATION then it is tasked! You can also see when the last
FOXACID redirection took place.
