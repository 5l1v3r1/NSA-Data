Sorry to bother you with constant emails but did you receive any
information on this. We attempted to task some of Sadequee’s selectors
in CADENCE yesterday but feel short as we did not have the FBI FISA
justification. Any help you can provide would be most valueable.

Thanks

again.

- FISA REQUEST

Mr.

/

This is SrA	at NSA/CSS Hawaii HS2I2 (Sunni

Extremism). I am writingyouDecause I am attempting to retrieve a
FISA

justification on Al Qa’ida operative Ehsanul Sadequee. Currently,

HS2I2

in conjunction with HS32 (Network Development Department) and NSA are
planning on conducting a TAO operation against Sadequee’s email
addresses. In order to conduct the operation HS2I2 needs the original
justification as well as any followups and resubmittals. We were
hoping

that you would be able to retrieve this information for us so that we
can submit a TAO on this target. Our intent is to begin the TAO before
this weekend. Sorry about the short notice but the reason behind our
request is that FBI is conducting an operation to apprehend Sadequee
sometime this week. Once he is apprehended NSA can no longer conduct a
TAO operation against him as the AG2.5 we currently have will be
invalid. The reason we are pursing this is because we would like to
retrieve a file that was passed between him and an associate about
three

weeks ago. The original FISA request was iniated in January 2006 and

will expire in April 2006. We appreciate any help you can provide us.
Thanks in advance.
