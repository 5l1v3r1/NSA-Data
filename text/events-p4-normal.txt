Events arc forwarded in a format specified in an ICD. Traditionally each database, c.g. SALAMANCA or
HAUSTORIUM, has had its own ICD. With the arrival of QFDs and the requirement for Convergence it
is becoming necessary for ICDs to focus on the Event type rather than any specific database.

The most important new ICDs in use are:

•	INTERSTELLAR DUST (IDUST)

•	Actor Action (AA)

IDUST was the first ICD capable of covering new GTDIs (Presence Events}. It is a Single-Line Record
(SLR) format.

Each Event type is specified individually in the ICD. They include:

•	Presence Events (for MUTANT BROTH, AUTOASSOC)

•	Google Maps/Earth (for MARBLED GECKO)

•	HTTP GET & POST (for KARMA POLICE)

•	HTTP Host Rcferer (for HR MAP)

•	Web Search (for MEMORY HOLE)

•	VBulletin (for INFINITE MONKEYS)

•	Social Networks (for SOCIAL ANIMAL)

•	Auto TDI (for AUTO TDI)

•	HTTP Host URI (for SAMUEL PEPYS)

•	FTP (for SAMUEL PEPYS)

feditl Actor Action (AA)

AA is the newest ICD. It provides a generic schema allowing for different types of Event. It is replacing
the old CorrcspondcnccData, PrcscnccData, IMData and IMdataOffbox formats while new event types arc
also being developed, for example for Mobile Apps. Some IDUST Events arc also likely to migrate across
to AA, while others may remain in IDUST format.

AA is initially intended to cover Presence and Communication (Social) Events only:

•	Presence (GTDI) (for HARD ASSOC, evolved MUTANT BROTH)

•	Communication (for SOCIAL ANTHROPOID)

Protocols and Apps currently adopting AA format include:
