Data Feeds in BLACK HOLE

10.The NGE and TR BLACK HOLES will store files containing a variety of meta data,
including Target Detection Identifiers (TDIs) and encrypted content.

11 .The feeds into NGE BLACK HOLE Benhall will initially be:

. GTE TELLURIANS
. MTI TELLURIANS
. TR DEBIT CARD

•	MTI IP Probes

•	MTI Debit Card

. Adhoc MAILORDER feeds from TR, OPD-GTE and OPC-TDSD
12.The feeds into NGE BLACK HOLE Bude are:

. MTI TELLURIANS (Via MAILORDER from Bude light distribution.)

•	MTI IP Probes

•	MTI Debit Card

13.lt should be noted that the NGE instances of BLACK HOLE will be fed a
massively increased volume of data compared with the existing TR BLACK HOLE.

14.	The aim is to feed 50 * 10Gs to Cheltenham and 34 * 10Gs to Bude, with Bude
feeds possibly increasing to 50 * 10Gs.

15.	Data stored on the NGE BLACK HOLE is protectively marked up to TOP
SECRET STRAP2 CHORDAL

16.	COI data feeds currently include:

. CHORDAL COI

17.	The retention period for all BLACK HOLE data (including Meta data considered as
Content) is 6 months, although this is subject to change if the nature of the feeds
going into BLACK HOLE changes significantly. The reason for this is that
although most of the content QFDs have a retention period limited to a month or
less, one - MARBLED GECKO has been assigned a retention period of 6 months.
As most of the access to the content data is via the QFDs which have the
individual controls applied, we are happy to grant the longer retention period for
the content data in BLACK HOLE itself for the purposes of developing the new
QFDs. Note: OPP-LEG will be kept abreast of new data types going into BLACK
HOLE in case they impact on the current balance of necessity and proportionality
that has led to the 6 month retention period being agreed.

18.	There is a NGE (SMOKING SADDLES) future requirement for CIRCUIT and
SALAMANCA data feeds into BLACK HOLE.
