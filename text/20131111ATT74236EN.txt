1.	Point 16 f of the resolution of 4 July 2013 on the US National Security Agency
surveillance programme, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their
impact on EU citizens' privacy instructs the LIBE Committee to report back by
"issuing recommendations aimed at strengthening IT security in the EU's institutions,
bodies and agencies by means of proper internal security rules for communication
systems, in order to prevent and remedy unauthorised access and the disclosure or
loss of information and personal data (remedying of security breaches);".

Press reports suggest that in a number of cases the security of EU institutions was
compromised. Reference has been made to EU diplomatic mission in the US but also
the Institutions in Brussels.

In Session I the inquiry will turn to questions such as technical possibilities to protect
the Institutions, current security measures and recommendations for improvements.
One session of the inquiry has already discussed the case of Belgacom and a judicial
inquiry is on-going

(http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/libe/events.html?action=0&id=hea

rings#menuzone).

With regard to the large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice
there have been reports in various media sources before the summer break that the
Schengen Information System has been hacked. The Danish Minister of Justice,
Morten Boedskov, is quoted saying that hackers accessed "some information" from
the Schengen Information System. (http://euobserver.com/tickers/120413)
Commissioner Malmström provided more detailed information on this incident in a
letter to Mr López Aguilar of 18.10.2013.

2.	Follow-up on the previous (7th and 11th November) hearings, Session II will continue
exploring the different national practices of parliamentary or other independent
oversight of national intelligence activities, with representatives of different Member
States' national Parliaments. This Session will consider the situation in Belgium and
in Denmark.
