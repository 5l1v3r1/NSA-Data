MONKEYROCKET: (TS//SI//NOFORN) xks-master went into a frozen state.
After further examination by ETC technicians it was noted with a hard drive
failure. Upon replacement of the hard drive with a new one, the drive would not
rebuild. As such, potential backplane faults. XKeyscore2 was reconfigured to be
the master server and all data and tasking was rerouted to the processing box.
XKS1 replacement logistics are being worked.

(TS//SI//NOFORN) ETC technician is hand-carrying data diodes and some RAMM
DIMMS back to site to repair the high side server and add a diode to the
secondary box.
