-	(U) Talk about the how the need for information sharing (need to share)
became an urgent one after the events of September 11, 2001.

-	(U) 9/11 Commission recommended that the Intelligence
Community transform from a Need to Know to a Need to Share
mentality.

only between the 5-Eyes but within the US SIGINT Systems
(USSS).

with the 5-Eyes.

-	(U) Click 1: In fact the directors committed themselves to developing single
query access to get metadata from across the 5-Eyes community.

-	(U) Click 2: So they signed the Alice Springs Resolution seen here.

-	(S//SI) Click 3: Summed up, they agreed to the development of single query
access to all metadata repositories across the 5-Eyes.

-	(U) QUESTION: Can anyone tell me who the 5-Eyes are?

-	(U) ANSWERS: UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United States

-	(U) Click 4: The result was the establishment of SMAC and a foundation for
realizing broader collaboration among the 5-Eyes for SIGINT.

-	(U) QUESTION: We've been talking a lot about metadata. So what is
metadata?

-	(U) DEFINITION: Metadata

- It is data about data; derived, extracted or inferred information that
represents the original data in some way.

browser.

(U) Student Interaction

- (U) Students should provide input on what metadata is as well as offer
suggestions on who the 5-Eyes are.

-(S//SI) FROM ASR Web
site: The Alice Springs
Resolution (ASR) is a Road
Map to sharing data
between NSA, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and
the United Kingdom. In
July 2004, DIRNSA, LTG
Hayden, and Signals
Intelligence Director, MG
Quirk met with the directors
of our agency counterparts
and their SIGINT directors
to build a Five Eyes agency
partnership. One result of
the meeting was formally
documented in the "Alice
Springs Resolution;" the
document was signed by
the Five Eyes agency
directors. The signatures
demonstrated their
commitment to enable
unfettered access to
metadata repositories
among our five agencies.

Instructor Notes

-	(U//FOUO) Through collaboration is encouraged for many reasons and
access to data across the SIGINT community is growing by the day,
there are still some things that are considered before sharing including

-	(S//SI) Partner identities

-	(S//SI) Partner Agreements

-	(S//SI) Interception Points

-	(S//SI) Partner Identities and Agreements- While 2nd party partners
may know of the existence of a small number of our third party partners
(ex. SISECT), we generally do not share information on the details of
those relationships. Nor do we share the existence of sensitive 3rd
party partners with 2nd party, nor with other 3rd party partners.

-	(S//SI) Interception Points - Even though metadata or content from
communications originating from sensitive access points may be
shared under certain circumstances with our partners, the particulars
on where and how the communications were intercepted are usually
not shared.
