(U) Project Description

(TS//SI//NF) The GENIE Project underpins NSA/CSS’ Computer Network Operations (CNO) Endpoint
capabilities conducted by the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) Group. The GENIE Project plans, equips, and
conducts Endpoint operations that actively compromise otherwise intractable targets and complement Midpoint
programs that passively eavesdrop on communications links. GENIE Endpoint activities use surreptitious virtual
or physical access to create and sustain a presence inside targeted systems or facilities. Targeted systems are
compromised electronically, typically providing access to system functions as well as data. System logs and
processes are modified to cloak the intrusion, facilitate future access, and accomplish other operational goals. Data
of interest is harvested directly or pushed (shaped) to Midpoint collectors (a form of active-passive integration)
and can also assist HUMINT, law enforcement, and DoD Information Operation activities as authorized.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) To maximize agility and minimize risk and cost, a targeted system is usually
subverted remotely, via existing tools/implants and infrastructure. When remote access is not possible, field
operations are undertaken - usually with the aid of other IC or DoD activities - to physically place hardware
implants or software modifications into or near targeted systems, or, if absolutely necessary, to conduct short-
range collection. Flardware and software engineering is required to upgrade capabilities, through anticipatory
efforts against leading commercial products as well as more directed work to fill key gaps against specific targets.

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint activities support the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNC1) and the IC's Next Generation Wireless (NGW) IC Wireless Implementation Plan (ICWIP)
aimed at preventing technological surprise by having the right NGW capabilities at the right time while achieving
cost savings through cross-IC collaboration.

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint capabilities are leveraged to support Title 10 CNO under
USCYBERCOM direction and legal authority. Similarly, TAO uses MIP Intelligence Support to Information
Operations resources to posture the Endpoint infrastructure and tools with sufficient diversity to conduct Title 10
CNO. Additionally, GENIE Endpoint operations are conducted to detect foreign cyber operations to support
dynamic defense of DoD networks.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Exploitation of Endpoint devices (e.g., personal computers, network servers
and routers, computer-controlled cellular systems and infrastructures, mobile computing devices, etc.) contributes
to hundreds of SIGINT reports each quarter, including CT-related and other SIG1NT reports that address the
highest priorities of the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF). GENIE Endpoint methods also
provide law enforcement, the military, and other customers with geolocation, lead information, target access, and
unique technical services. The broad range of GENIE activities requires continuous technical development to
keep pace with the rapid, market driven evolution of IT products and technology, which includes tools/implants

remaining stealthy against ever vigilant personal security products (e.g. anti-virus software and firewalls) that
could detect and thwart CNO.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint operations are performed over foundational infrastructure
capabilities, which must remain robust and defend against hostile intrusion. VALIANTEAGLE is a major
system acquisition that will incrementally provide more efficient planning, management, and execution of CNO
to support growing and diverse Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), Computer Network Defense (CND),
and Computer Network Attack (CNA) mission requirements. This Project contains the GENIE Operations,
Foundation Platforms, Point Solutions, Deployable Tools, and VALIANTEAGLE Sub-Projects.

(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop tools and integrate mission management capabilities with partners
across the IC in response to cyber security threats.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Sustain covert domestic and overseas collection platforms (i.e., listening
posts) working in close collaboration with the FBI and the CIA.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Defend the Endpoint operational infrastructure against increasing foreign
and domestic cyber threats.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Enhance GENlE's Endpoint mission management and processing
infrastructure to more efficiently and effectively plan, manage, and execute diverse sets of CNO operations.
VALIANTEAGLE will integrate into the TURBULENCE architecture and other corporate systems.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide specialized training for an increased number of CNO target network
analysts and exploitation operators to support increased missions.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop and support Endpoint exploitation and collection tools for data
and voice networks, computer hardware and software, specialized solutions for hard target exploitation,
and geolocation capabilities. Develop and sustain software and hardware implants designed to circumvent
security technologies used by targets.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop NGW exploitation capabilities supporting the ICWIP.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support the SIGINT exploitation of NGW, a MIP/NIP collective investment.
This request reflects only the NIP portion of the program. Refer to MIP NSA volume for details on MIP
related activities.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide a covert data exfiltration, and command & control infrastructure,
for voice network exploitation and collection against targets that utilize Code Division Multiplexing
Access 2000 (CDMA-2000) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) technologies.
Deliver geolocation capabilities for commercially-employed NGW technologies (e.g., CDMA-2000, UMTS
including Long Term Evolution) to ensure continued operational success in locating high priority targets
that use evolving wireless technology.

•	(TS//SF/REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide high quality voice collection by delivering implants that can identify
select voice conversations of interest within a target network and exfiltrate select cuts back to NSA/CSS.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide a diverse CNO toolset to allow for the prosecution of varied CNO
missions with increased operational security.

• (TS//SI//NF) Develop shaping capabilities to exfiltrate CNE through passive collection systems to more
effectively handle the increasing volumes of Endpoint derived data, and conversely minimize unnecessary
exposure of the covert infrastructure. Further, shaping extends the reach of passive collection systems by
ensuring network traffic of interest passes a passive sensor in order to be collected and processed.

(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.

(U) OCO resources in this project are used to:

• (TS//SF/REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop, deploy, and sustain CNO access to the most sensitive of the
Pakistan and Afghanistan government's leadership communications.

•	(TS//S1//REL TO USA, FVEY) Keep pace with terrorists’ use of the latest in telecommunication and
information technology. It is imperative that GENIE lean as far forward as possible in developing CNO
exploitation tools against new technologies (e.g., Windows 8, 9). Unlike nation/states that migrate in a more
cost effective manner, terrorists often jump from technology to technology as a means of providing security
for their communications. These funds enable Endpoint operations to be better positioned for these changes
in order to maintain coverage on high value terrorist targets.

(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:

•	(TS//S1//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop and deploy CNO implants for routers, switches, and firewalls from
multiple product vendor lines directed at satisfying Endpoint specific intelligence collection requirements.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Enable automated and on-demand multi-hop operations to reduce the
number of manual interactive operations required and enable deeper penetration into target networks.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Increase reliance on commercial products for hardware bridging implant
concealments to improve cost and shorten development cycle.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop and deliver capabilities that will allow Endpoint implants to persist in
target computers/servers through technology upgrades, and enable the development of new methodologies
to persist and maintain presence within hard target networks. Due to the ever increasing capabilities of
internet security technologies, an emphasis will be placed on developing persistent solutions that incorporate
stealth techniques.

•	(TS/./SF/REL TO USA, FVEY) Increase serialized reporting from Endpoint collection against hard targets
to 55-60 percent, a 5 percent increase over the FY 2012 target level.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Modernize the Endpoint infrastructure by executing the VALIANTEAGLE
acquisition. Verify that developed prototype capabilities satisfy requirements via the Developmental Test/
Operational Assessment activity.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Increase the number of Endpoint Points-of-Presence (PoPs) worldwide to
a range of 85,000-96,000, a 13 percent increase over the FY 2012 target.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Increase Endpoint active accesses to 9,000-10,000, a 12 percent increase
over the FY 2012 target level.
