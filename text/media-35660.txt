(U) Project Description

The GENIE Project underpins Computer Network Operations (CNO) Endpoint
capabilities conducted by the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) Group. The GENIE Project plans, equips, and
conducts Endpoint operations that actively compromise otherwise intractable targets and complement Midpoint
programs that passively eavesdrop on communications links. GENIE Endpoint activities use surreptitious virtual
or physical access to create and sustain a presence inside targeted systems or facilities. Targeted systems are
compromised electronically, typically providing access to system functions as well as data. System logs and
processes are modi?ed to cloak the intrusion, facilitate future access, and accomplish other operational goals. Data
of interest is harvested directly or pushed (shaped) to Midpoint collectors (a form of active?passive integration)
and can also assist HUMINT, law enforcement, and DOD Information Operation activities as authorized.

TO USA, FVEY) To maximize agility and minimize risk and cost, a targeted system is usually
subverted remotely, via existing tools/implants and infrastructure. When remote access is not possible, field
operations are undertaken usually with the aid of other or DOD activities to physically place hardware
implants or software modifications into or near targeted systems, or, if absolutely necessary, to conduct short?
range collection. Hardware and software engineering is required to upgrade capabilities, through anticipatory
efforts against leading commercial products as well as more directed work to fill key gaps against specific targets.

TO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint activities support the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNCI) and the IC's Next Generation Wireless (NGW) IC Wireless Implementation Plan (ICWIP)
aimed at preventing technological surprise by having the right NGW capabilities at the right time while achieving
cost savings through cross?1C collaboration.

TO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint capabilities are leveraged to support Title 10 CNO under
USCYBERCOM direction and legal authority. Similarly, TAO uses MIP Intelligence Support to Information
Operations resources to posture the Endpoint infrastructure and tools with sufficient diversity to conduct Title 10
CNO. Additionally, GENIE Endpoint operations are conducted to detect foreign cyber operations to support
dynamic defense of networks.

TO USA, FVEY) Exploitation of Endpoint devices personal computers, network servers
and routers, computer?controlled cellular systems and infrastructures, mobile computing devices, etc.) contributes
to hundreds of SIGINT reports each quarter, including CT?related and other SIGINT reports that address the
highest priorities of the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF). GENIE Endpoint methods also
provide law enforcement, the military, and other customers with geolocation, lead information, target access, and
unique technical services. The broad range of GENIE activities requires continuous technical development to
keep pace with the rapid, market driven evolution of IT products and technology, which includes tools/implants

could detect and thwart CNO.

TO USA, FVEY) GENIE Endpoint operations are performed over foundational infrastructure
capabilities, which must remain robust and defend against hostile intrusion. VALIANTEAGLE is a major
system acquisition that will incrementally provide more efficient planning, management, and execution of CNO
to support growing and diverse Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), Computer Network Defense (CND),
and Computer Network Attack (CNA) mission requirements. This Project contains the GENIE Operations,
Foundation Platforms, Point Solutions, Deployable Tools, and VALIANTEAGLE Sub?Projects.

and exploitation operators to support increased missions.

TO USA, FVEY) Develop and support Endpoint exploitation and collection tools for data
and voice networks, computer hardware and software, specialized solutions for hard target exploitation,
and geolocation capabilities. Develop and sustain software and hardware implants designed to circumvent
security technologies used by targets.

TO USA, FVEY) Develop NGW exploitation capabilities supporting the ICWIP.

TO USA, FVEY) Support the SIGINT exploitation of NGW, a collective investment.

including Long Term Evolution) to ensure continued operational success in locating high priority targets
that use evolving wireless technology.

Develop shaping capabilities to exfiltrate CNE through passive collection systems to more
effectively handle the increasing volumes of Endpoint derived data, and conversely minimize unnecessary
exposure of the covert infrastructure. Further, shaping extends the reach of passive collection systems by
ensuring network traffic of interest passes a passive sensor in order to be collected and processed.

(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.

(U) OCO resources in this project are used to:

 

TO USA, FVEY) Develop, deploy, and sustain CNO access to the most sensitive of the
Pakistan and Afghanistan government?s leadership communications.

TO USA, FVEY) Keep pace with terrorists? use of the latest in telecommunication and
information technology. It is imperative that GENIE lean as far forward as possible in developing CNO
exploitation tools against new technologies Windows 8, 9). Unlike nation/ states that migrate in a more
cost effective manner, terrorists often jump from technology to technology as a means of providing security
for their communications. These funds enable Endpoint operations to be better positioned for these changes
in order to maintain coverage on high value terrorist targets.

(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:

TO USA, VEY) Develop and deploy CNO implants for routers, switches, and firewalls from
multiple product vendor lines directed at satisfying Endpoint specific intelligence collection requirements.

TO USA, FVEY) Enable automated and on?demand multi?hop operations to reduce the
number of manual interactive operations required and enable deeper penetration into target networks.

TO USA, FVEY) Increase reliance on commercial products for hardware bridging implant
concealments to improve cost and shorten development cycle.

TO USA, VEY) Develop and deliver capabilities that will allow Endpoint implants to persist in
target computers/servers through technology upgrades, and enable the development of new methodologies
to persist and maintain presence within hard target networks. Due to the ever increasing capabilities of
internet security technologies, an emphasis will be placed on developing persistent solutions that incorporate
stealth techniques.

TO USA, FVEY) Increase serialized reporting from Endpoint collection against hard targets
to 55?60 percent, a 5 percent increase over the FY 2012 target level.

TO USA, FVEY) Modernize the Endpoint infrastructure by executing the VALIANTEAGLE
acquisition. Verify that developed prototype capabilities satisfy requirements via the Developmental Test/
Operational Assessment activity.

TO USA, FVEY) Increase the number of Endpoint Points?of?Presence (PoPs) worldwide to
a range of 85,000?96,000, a 13 percent increase over the FY 2012 target.

TO USA, FVEY) Increase Endpoint active accesses to 9,000?10,000, a 12 percent increase
over the FY 2012 target level.
