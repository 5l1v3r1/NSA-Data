Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 03/08/2004<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III <br>SID Chief of Staff <br>(U//FOUO) The SID leadership is proud to announce the newly established Long Term TDY<br>Deployment Process . This new process is intended to deploy skilled personnel in a timely<br>manner for NIST and other recurring TDY's. It will ensure that we select viable candidates far<br>enough in advance so that the individuals can be properly trained and prepared for their<br>deployment. The process will also assist in establishing priorities in the future, will identify<br>funding, and will provide SID leadership with a much-needed overall picture of how many people<br>are out of the building and what they are supporting.<br>(U//FOUO) This new process is very timely, as there are now more personnel being deployed on<br>long-term TDY's (anything over 14 days but less than 129 days) than ever before. Projections<br>are that this number will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, due to both world events<br>and our ever-closer interaction with our customers.<br>(U//FOUO) A new forum will update a corporate list of recurring TDY requirements, monitor the<br>process, and provide OIC/NCR** candidates to the SID Staff for coordination. This forum will<br>include representatives from S1, S2, S3, SID Staff, SIG DEV, and SID SEA. Points of contact are<br>as follows:<br>(U//FOUO) POCs for requirements (i.e. the entry point for any entity submitting a requirement<br>for TDY personnel augmentation):<br>SID Staff - Chief, SIGINT Support Services (<br>, <br>SIG DEV - Chief of Staff (<br>)<br>S1 - S13 Chief of Staff, Military Integration (Steve M. Hart,<br>S2 - Deployment Services <br>@nsa)<br>S3 - Chief of Staff (<br><br>)<br><br>(U//FOUO) POCs for long-term TDY deployments (the specific person to contact in your<br>organization if you are deploying):<br>SID Staff - <br> (<br>SIG DEV - George Mohnasky (<br>)<br>S1 - <br> (<br>) and CW3 <br>S2 - <br> <br>S3 - <br> (<br>); Alternate -<br><br>)<br> (<br><br>(U) Hostile areas POC :<br>(U//FOUO) The above identifies the SID person to contact, but in addition Human Resources has<br>responsibility to prepare and deploy those going to hostile areas. Therefore, in addition to the<br>SID POC, please contact Debbie Rhyne <br>in the HR Deployment Center.<br>(U//FOUO) If you deploy on a frequent basis or believe that you might volunteer or be asked to<br>deploy in the near future, please review the Hostile Area Deployment Center's Pre-deployment<br>Mandatory Processing Checklist (via a link at the top of the left column on their webpage). These<br>guidelines will help you to be prepared both personally and professionally well in advance.<br>**OIC/NCR = Officer in Charge/National Cryptologic Representative<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
