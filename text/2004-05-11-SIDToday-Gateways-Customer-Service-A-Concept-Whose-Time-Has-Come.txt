It was formed to address the many special<br>needs of internal (NSA) and certain external clients, including requirements falling outside the<br>established National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP).<br>(U//FOUO) With the drawdown of Battle Bridge operations in mid-April 2003, the SCC reverted<br>to an 8-hour a day schedule while continuing to support the Customer Information Needs Desk<br>(CINDesk) on the NSOC floor, the 24/7 SID "front door" for time-critical customer requests.<br>Today, the SCC serves as an innovative and much-needed focal point for satisfying customer<br>service needs.<br>(U//FOUO) The SCC handles a wide variety of requests from all kinds of customers. For<br>example:<br>(S//SI) An Army Intelligence Officer assigned to Fort Eustis, Virginia had a hard-drive<br>failure and requested assistance to recover vital classified information on the hard-drive.<br>The officer turned to NSA for help when the command's Information Technology Support<br>Center was unable to provide the necessary assistance. A series of phone calls led to a<br>point-of-contact (POC) in the Hardware Bridging Office who accepted the task. The<br>customer and the POC were united and the problem was resolved.<br>(S//SI) In another instance, the SCC and the CINDesk began coordinating requests for<br>the release of potentially actionable dialing records to foreign liaison partners. When the<br>SCC and CINDesk took this on, it took an average of 38 days to get these released. It is<br>now done in less than a week, and within a few hours for critical requests.<br>(S//SI) In November 2003, the task of tracking incoming requests from tactical elements<br>directly involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom<br>(OEF) for access to four National SIGINT databases was transferred from S141, National<br>Tactical Technology and Interoperability Division, to the SCC. On 8 December, SID<br>expanded this duty to include tracking requests for any database access received from<br>any NSA/CSS activity. The transfer of this process to the SCC reduced the average<br>number of days from request to access from 77 to 8.<br>(S//SI) The SCC anticipates the further expansion of its mission to handle "special requests"<br>from other activities such as CIA's Directorate of Operations. This initiative will continue to be<br>further refined as the SID moves toward implementation of DIRNSA's Transformation 2.0<br>strategy for teaming and greater sharing of information.<br>(U//FOUO) The SCC is currently staffed by retirees brought back to assist during OIF/OEF under<br>the Temporary Employment During National Emergency (TEDNE) program. Collectively, the<br>team members have extensive experience in the military, the commercial sector, and Agency<br>operations. Experience in the field of communications and analysis, education and training,<br>computer applications, oral and written communications skills, and an urgent sense of prompt<br>service to its customers are hallmarks of the SCC team.<br>(U//FOUO) If you would like to know more about the SCC, visit our website or "go SCC," give us<br>call on <br>, drop us an email at <br>@nsa, or stop in for a visit in <br>.<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
