Although I knew going into the meeting<br>that they had done much to assist our tactical forces in the region, I wanted to hear what they<br>had learned on the job, and what the SIGINT System can "learn" as well.<br>(U//FOUO) They told me that they had gained an appreciation for what "timely" means at a<br>tactical level, and highlighted the need for quick responses. The CST'ers also learned what it's<br>like to deal with NSA from the "outside looking in," and how best to make the right connections<br>at NSA to answer questions and resolve problems. They also witnessed the importance of<br>"translating" SIGINT for the tactical commanders to help them understand how the SIGINT could<br>serve as the basis for military operations.<br>(U//FOUO) What can NSA and the SIGINT System learn from their experience? One lesson is<br>that the Agency needs clearer poc's as anchor points for responding to requests from tactical<br>units. This means developing a structured way of providing assistance that will not hinge upon<br>the field representative having the right personal contacts at the Agency. We can also identify<br>the optimal training requirements for CST'ers and deployers of all kinds, and the returnees are<br>helping us do just that. I asked them to write a paper giving their observations, and I plan to<br>provide that to the Army so that they study it for lessons learned, as well.<br>(U//FOUO) These CST'ers gave outstanding service to NSA and to the customer. They each<br>related to me that the tour made an indelible impression, yielding experiences they'll never<br>forget. I expressed my gratitude for their enormous contribution in helping leverage the 20,00030,000 soldiers on the ground in each Division as partners.<br>(S//SI) In the past, about 90% of tactical military operations in Iraq were based on HUMINT;<br>now the share attributable to SIGINT is much higher, thanks to the efforts of SIGINT'ers<br>deployed to the region, such as the CSTs, CSG elements working with the Special Forces,<br>SIGINT'ers with I MEF's Second Radio Battalion, and others. In the last six months, tactical units<br>have captured, killed, or wounded tens of thousands of insurgent forces in Iraq.<br>(U//FOUO) As the Director has often noted, where we have people deployed, our SIGINT has<br>meaning -- otherwise our material is just in the inbox. The CST participants, as well as all those<br>who have volunteered for deployment forward, are helping the Agency evolve into an<br>expeditionary SIGINT force.<br>(U) I encourage all analysts to consider participating in deployments like this, where they can<br>make a decisive contribution to our nation's efforts in Iraq.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
