(S//SI)<br>(S//SI) As I was sitting in the Heathrow terminal on an eight-hour<br>layover, awaiting my flight to Islamabad, I thought about all the<br>advice I had been given the week before my departure. Several<br>experienced travelers had suggested I buy baggy clothes and a<br>headscarf to cover myself, while others claimed that Islamabad<br>was a fairly progressive city compared to the rest of Pakistan. I<br>was anxious to find out for myself and excited about the<br>opportunity to be part of the first NSA SIGINT Fusion Cell at<br>Station* Islamabad. Over the next four and a half months, I would<br>learn the importance of this team and why Station once described<br>SIGINT as "the only game in town" during a critical time in the<br>Pakistani Spring Offensive when there were no other intelligence<br>sources available.<br>(S) Just a few weeks before, I had been making preparations to<br>deploy to Baghdad as part of a NIST team , which was a logical<br>follow-on to the Iraq reporting I had been doing in the<br>Counterterrorism (CT) Sunni Extremism Branch. When the NIST<br>office asked if I would be interested in a brand-new position in<br>Pakistan instead, I eagerly jumped at the chance to experience a<br>country I had studied in graduate school, as well as spent a year<br>targeting in the Pakistan Branch. I quickly went through the<br>deployment processing checklist, put my belongings into storage,<br>and boarded the plane less than three weeks later.<br>(U//FOUO) When I touched down in Pakistan, it was obvious that I<br>would need to get accustomed to the constant stream of stares and<br>curious looks I would receive, since women with blonde hair are a<br>rarity. As I sat alone in the terminal waiting for my driver, with<br>literally hundreds of Pakistanis in traditional dress watching me<br>inquisitively, it truly hit me that I was embarking on one of the<br>most exciting times in my personal and professional career. I was<br>taken <br> where I would be living out of my two<br>suitcases for the next four and a half months. I instantly thought of<br>how different my living arrangements would have been in<br>Baghdad, as I was now in a mini-bar stocked room and able to<br>enjoy all the amenities that a Western hotel has to offer.<br><br>(U) A colorful jinga bus filled with passengers in Taxila.<br>(TS//SI) The Embassy compound itself is one of the largest in the<br>world and sports a new gym, pool, restaurant/club, track, and<br>softball field.

I became the NSA CT<br>representative to the Settled Areas Office (SAO) Liaison Branch,<br>which focuses exclusively on non-tribal areas such as Islamabad,<br>Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta. My role would be to<br>provide NSA CT analytic support and keep SAO informed of any<br>relevant NSA reporting or SIGINT leads. SAO, in conjunction with<br>the Pakistani partner, has been responsible for over 600 arrests<br>since September 11. I would be able to witness first-hand the<br>arrest of several dozen terrorists during my tenure at Station.<br>(TS//SI) My typical workday began around 0830 when I started<br>preparations for my daily SIGINT briefing to the Tribal Areas Office<br>and also COS (Chief of Station) Islamabad, which involved<br>prioritizing various SIGINT reporting, gists, or tips that we had<br>received. Following the briefings, I dedicated the rest of the day to<br>supporting the SAO targeters and acting as the middleman<br>between Station and NSAW to facilitate a variety of issues. I<br>coordinated with the appropriate offices at NSA to ensure that<br>Station had the most up-to-date intelligence possible, as well as<br>keep NSA apprised of activity in the field. In addition to the steady<br>stream of support I received from HQs, I was able to utilize the<br>various NSA databases and analytic tools to provide services<br>ranging from a quick number look-up to comprehensive targeting<br>packages.<br>(TS//SI) As mentioned above, SAO works closely with its liaison<br>counterpart to track and arrest high-value targets throughout<br>Pakistan, which means that Station must supply daily releasable<br>tearlines with the relevant intelligence. I was able to author several<br>of these tearlines, as well as coordinate approvals with the<br>necessary offices at NSAW. There were several occasions when I<br>was literally on the phone with NSOC while a SAO targeter waited<br>in the doorway for approval to pass the time-sensitive message to<br>liaison.<br>(TS//SI) Perhaps the best aspect about the position was that it<br>afforded me the opportunity to witness the start of one of the most<br>collaborative ventures NSA has undertaken. With the stand-up of<br>the Fusion Cell, NSA became truly integrated with Station<br>personnel for the first time and was able to contribute in ways that<br>were once impossible. As the SAO representative, I was able to<br>coordinate with NSAW, Bagram, GRSOC, and the Tribal Areas<br>Office at Station to ensure that actionable SIGINT was in the<br>operators' hands as close to real-time as possible.<br>(TS//SI) One success story was when a high-value target was<br>captured due to timely intelligence and a good working relationship<br>between NSA and CIA. Analysts at NSAW worked extra hours to<br>ensure that Station had the latest DNI and telephony intelligence,<br>which were often the first tippers or reporting that we received in<br>the field. A combination of NSAW tippers, CIA cable traffic, and<br>front-end analysis in the SAO all contributed to a successful<br>capture operation.<br><br>(S//SI) The original NSA SIGINT Fusion Cell at Station Islamabad.<br>The author is third from the right.<br>*Notes: <br>(S) The term "Station" refers to a CIA operations center located<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$2.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">within a US Embassy abroad.<br>(U) Watch for the conclusion of this article, coming soon...<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
