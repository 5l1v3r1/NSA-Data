Networks offer both<br>opportunity and threat in the global signal environment. This is especially true in areas where<br>vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques overlap between NSA's "Provide" and "Protect"<br>missions. To jointly meet this challenge, people-to-people "networking" between SID and IAD<br>leadership is on the rise.<br>(S) More and more, the way we do SIGINT is how we do IA. Meaning: we exploit our enemy's<br>networks by using networks. Therefore, the logical next step after we discover an enemy's<br>vulnerability in the process of doing SIGINT is to share that weakness with those who protect<br>our networks, and thus increase our chances of surviving the same level of attack from others.<br>The same holds true in reverse. The experts in Information Assurance can help guide our efforts<br>to find those vulnerable spots in targeted networks.<br>(S) <br> and I have hosted a series of off-sites in which our respective leadership teams meet to<br>collaborate on common issues and to seek integrated approaches to the opportunities and threat<br>of today's global signal environment. At the most recent of these off-sites, held on 15 July, we<br>covered topics ranging from the governance of NSA and its extended enterprise to information<br>sharing issues related to Transformation 2.0 . One excellent example of our future-oriented<br>integration is the NSA Threat Analysis Center, a joint I4 and S2 operation.<br>(U//FOUO) Other topics included:<br>Continued and improved cooperation with other Intelligence Agencies,<br>NSA/CSS Governance and,<br>Opportunities for SID and IAD personnel to spend a few months in one another's shoes.<br>(S) As we work to exploit foreign networks, protect our own, and take on an increased role in<br>offensive information operations, collaboration opportunities between SID and IAD will grow.<br>Numerous SIGINT and Information Assurance challenges lie ahead as our nation builds DoD's<br>Global Information Grid and establishes Horizontal Integration across the Intelligence<br>Community.<br>(U) We are eager to have our next sessions and continue to address these challenges together.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
