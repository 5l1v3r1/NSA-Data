OP SOCIALIST Outcome

In MyNOC:

-	CNE Access to BELGACOM - MERION ZETA - 6 endpoints into

Engineer/support staff IP range

-	2 endpoints into BELGACOM DMZ (from prep VA work)

-	Optimal Bearers identified providing good access to BELGACOM proxy.

Post MyNOC:

-	Optimal Bearers continue to allow QI against BELGACOM engineers/proxy

-	Internal CNE access continues to expand - getting close to access core
GRX Routers - currently on hosts with access

-	NAC continue to support with Network Analysis
of internal networks, network understanding
research on credentials and identification of
engineers/system administrators and their
specific roles.
