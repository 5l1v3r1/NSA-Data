Legal Context

This is a powerful that allows you to pull back presence events for an IP network.

?roiu must make sure that your HRA justification (Reason) clearly explains Why you are Querying on an IP network, as you are more likeiy to retrieve the oorrimunitations of innocent individuals as well as tar:
. Your queries will be logged for audst.
. ?rou should use Tracorputo or EINS Idolr up first So that only IP prefixes registered or associated with the target networks are queried.
. If you suspect that the prefix rs dynamic, you must either combine this search with another filter' eg an HHFP or limit the query to 60 minutes.

If after running the query. it is clear that the prefix is dynamic. you should not loolr.r at the results as they are until-ter to relate to item target.

Search for IP address pre?x-5

- Enter the set IP address prefixes.
