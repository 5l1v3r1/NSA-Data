Tech Extractor vs. Fingerprints

Tech Extractor treats E-mail, Chat and Document
bodies as a single “context”

The XKS Fingerprint language gives you over 65+
contexts that can be used together to form powerful
and specific signatures

When terms are generic and are returning too many
poor results through Tech Extractor, then it’s time to
make the switch to the full fingerprint language
