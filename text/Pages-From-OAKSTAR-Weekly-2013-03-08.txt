MONKEYROCKET: (TS//SI/NF) Collection loss for pail of March 5 and 6th. High side
data diode in error. Tweaked some of the diode parameters and rebooted server to rectify.

(TS//SI//NF) Due to larger influx of traffic from the partner, the NIAGARAFILES was
not sending data quick enough via the ftp process to the XKeyscore causing the disk
space to fill up and data forwarding delays. A parameter was tweaked in the
NIAGARAFILES configuration to poll the directories at a timeout of 3 seconds vice 60
seconds.

(TS//SI//NF) Partner provided inclusion of fhst/last name parameters for the XKeyscore
external metadata table information. Updates were made to the modification scripts to
adjust the ingest.

(TS//NF) No data on 11 March 2013 and we are working with engineering to pin
point the issue.

(TS//NF) SSG11 analysts have found value in the MONKEYROCKET access to
help track down senders and receivers of Bitcoins (a decentralized digital
currency system, wherein the units are known as Bitcoins or BTC.) (SNM)

(TS//NF) S2F214 is hoping to use the access for their mission of looking at
organized crime and cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services to move
and launder money. These illicit finance networks provide user access to
international monetary systems, while providing a high-degree of anonymity.
