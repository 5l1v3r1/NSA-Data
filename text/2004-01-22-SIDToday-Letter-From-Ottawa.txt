Well, I have to tell<br>you, life in Ottawa is far too full to be taking time to write letters.<br>Instead of regular installments, how about one short note just to<br>give you a sense of things here?<br>(U) We are skating on the Rideau Canal, the world's longest ice<br>skating rink, now. Yes, it's blustery cold, but it doesn't seem so bad<br>when you can stop along the way to enjoy warm beaver tails and<br>hot chocolate. Even with the cold, I'd rather be skating than joining<br>the runners and bikers along Colonel By Drive or Queen Elizabeth<br>Drive either side of the canal. Yes, even in the snow! Next week,<br>we may cross-country ski between our home downtown and the<br>office at CSE along the paths of the Rideau River. All of this will put<br>us in perfect shape and in the right frame of mind to have a ball at<br>Winterlude in February. Maybe there'll be time to watch a Senators<br>ice hockey game or participate in the locals' curling tournament, as<br>well.<br>(U) Of course, we are eagerly anticipating spring and the tulips the<br>melting snow and sun will bring. Ottawa will come alive with color.<br>Once the warmer weather arrives, the hot air balloons will be back<br>floating through the skies of Ottawa each dusk and dawn, taking off<br>from Quebec across the Ottawa River and landing just a few<br>hundred yards from CSE. Soon after the balloons come back, it will<br>be time for the Ottawa Jazz Fest. We'll try to attend a few concerts<br>in between Ottawa Lynx games. Well, they are the Baltimore<br>Orioles Triple A farm team after all, and they made it all the way to<br>the playoffs last year.<br><br>Byward Market<br>(U) Summer will be time for meandering through the Byward<br>Market downtown taking in the smells and sights of all the<br>wonderful fresh locally grown produce, shopping for gifts for home,<br>or enjoying the vast selection of restaurants, cafes, and bars in this<br>most eclectic part of town. From the market, we'll head over to one<br>of the half dozen museums or the National Arts Center, or maybe<br>to Majors Park to lay back and listen to a jazz, blues, or classical<br>concert in view of Parliament. We'll also find an excuse to throw<br>the bikes on the car and head for the hills: the Gatineau Hills, in a<br>beautiful park at the edge of the Canadian Shield, just 10 minutes<br>from downtown Ottawa across the river. It will be a different world<br>there with only French being spoken.<br><br>1.  Letter From Ottawa<br>2.  Yakima: Fertile<br>Valley in the High<br>Desert<br>3.  Life in Alice<br>4.

I love the drive back to the city<br>almost as much as being away, especially at the holidays when<br>downtown Ottawa is a blaze of shimmering lights and color.<br>(U) I suppose you want to know what else there is to know about<br>Ottawa. Let me summarize by saying that it is a family-oriented<br>"small town" with all the amenities of a large capital city. The<br>schools are excellent, the commute is short (from everywhere), the<br>parking ample, the air clean, the shopping and dining terrific, the<br>cultural opportunities endless, and the work environment<br>invigorating and challenging. And New York is just an hour away if<br>you really feel the need to "go home." What more can I say. Come<br>visit. You'll love it here.
