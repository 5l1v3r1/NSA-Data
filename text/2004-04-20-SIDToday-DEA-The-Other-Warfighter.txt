But how many of us list illegal<br>narcotics among the top threats to our society? Our national leadership recognized the<br>seriousness this problem poses and declared a war on drugs two decades ago. This "war" has all<br>the risks, excitement, and dangers of conventional warfare, and the stakes are equally high.<br>(U//FOUO) We are all aware that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is leading our<br>nation's counternarcotics (CN) efforts. But many are not aware that from the start NSA has<br>been at the forefront of Intelligence Community (IC) support to this seemingly unconventional<br>DOD mission. The novel collection and analysis techniques NSA developed and refined against<br>these criminal hard targets have not only resulted in major successes in the war on drugs, but<br>they have also proven invaluable to other critical SIGINT missions, particularly counterterrorism,<br>sometimes blurring the lines between the two missions.<br>(C) DEA has close relationships with foreign government counterparts and vetted foreign<br>partners. The results of this team approach regularly make the headlines in the form of major<br>drug busts and arrests. Less known is the critical supporting role that NSA continues to play in<br>key DEA operations to disrupt the flow of narcotics to our country and thwart other, related<br>crimes. DEA, however, recognizes the unique access and sole source information NSA provides<br>and coordinates major cases with the S2F/ICN Product Line.<br>(C) As a result, both agencies enjoy a vibrant two-way information sharing relationship that<br>enhances their common mission. Processes have been carefully established to exchange lead<br>(foreign intelligence) information while protecting NSA equities. The Customer Relationships<br>Directorate (S1), the Data Acquisition Directorate (S3), and MRSOC work with the S2F/ICN<br>office as an integrated team to realize these mission successes.<br>(S//SI) One of those successes: Based on SCS (US-966L) intercept, S2F/ICN issued an OPS<br>IMMEDIATE report on 30 March 2004 on the exact whereabouts of Colombian narcotics trafficker<br>Gonzalo Hinojosa, an evasive and brutal international fugitive wanted for murder, drug<br>trafficking, and money laundering. S2F had the foresight to include a tearline to share the<br>actionable intelligence with Panamanian partners. With a short window for action, NSA's <br> worked through the Joint Interagency Task Force (JITF) - South to immediately<br>forward the information to DEA/Panama. DEA/Panama in turn alerted the Panamanian<br>authorities who quickly located and apprehended Hinojosa, without knowing the information<br>came from NSA SIGINT. As Chief <br> noted, this is an excellent example of<br>"outcome-oriented collaboration."<br>(U//FOUO) To learn more about NSA support to the "other" warfighter, DEA, visit the<br>International Crime and Narcotics (S2F) website.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
