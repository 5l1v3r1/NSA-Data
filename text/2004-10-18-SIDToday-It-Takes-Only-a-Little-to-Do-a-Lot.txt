Had a loved one affected by disease? Taken a walk in a park? I am<br>sure that all of us in one way or another have been affected by the myriad organizations<br>represented by CFC. During the next six weeks, it is our chance to give back to those people and<br>groups of people that have helped, consoled, toiled for our benefit.<br>(U) The National Security Agency has been a leader in the CFC for many years. Last year, the<br>SID workforce alone contributed almost $691,000 with only 18% participation. The participation<br>goal for the Agency this year is 25%. As the largest directorate at NSA, what a huge difference<br>SID could make if we raised our participation to 25%. This is SID's chance to lead the way to a<br>brighter future. Be a part of that future by choosing a charity and participating in the campaign.<br>(U) The benefits of contributing to a charity do not end with that "feel good" glow, however.<br>Because the contributions are annotated on your pay slip, it is easy, come tax time, to get the<br>final tally of your contributions. No saving receipts and check stubs to prove to the IRS that you<br>have been a charitable person all year.<br>(U) And with the online registration, participation is so easy. It takes less than 10 minutes and<br>there are no forms to fill out. Just type "go cfc" in your browser and click on the prompt for<br>online donation along the right hand side. You will also find the list of upcoming events and<br>activities for the remainder of the Campaign on this page!<br>(U) Throughout SID, each organization has a coordinator/canvasser to assist you with your<br>.<br>questions. For the list of SID CFC volunteers, visit<br>One of these volunteers may be contacting you and sharing information with you about the<br>Combined Federal Campaign. Listen to them.
