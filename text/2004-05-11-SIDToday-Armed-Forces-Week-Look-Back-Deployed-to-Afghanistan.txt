I am a MINSAP participant and this deployment seemed to be a natural extension of the office<br>I was working prior to going out. Although I had been working the Iraq target, the methods and<br>points of contact within NSA were something I was fairly comfortable with. <br> <br>Bagram, Afghanistan <br>(S) Upon my arrival in Bagram, I got off of a C-130 late in the evening and it was pitch dark.<br>There is a light discipline in effect for Bagram and no exterior lights are allowed around the<br>flight line. I was guided around the base (with cautions to "stay on the hardball, there are active<br>mines everywhere") and was shown to my tent.<br><br>(C) The NIST team members who were not on watch helped me bring my gear into the tent. I<br>passed out, exhausted, almost immediately after getting settled in. When I awoke the next<br>morning and stumbled from my cot out into the morning light, I gazed in wonder at my<br>surroundings. I was in the middle of a tent city that was ringed by snowcapped mountains. The<br>sun was just peeking over the mountain tops, illuminating a complete ecosystem starting to<br>bustle alive around me.<br>(S//SI) Once I settled into the routine, I quickly realized that we were in for some odd hours.<br>The three analysts switched off as there were not enough terminals for more than one of us at<br>any one time. We were on 8 hour shifts, but whenever anything odd came up, or we were<br>working some kind of 'pet project', we often stayed for many hours after shift. There was an<br>extra terminal that was reserved for the senior analyst who was not always there and we would<br>commandeer that machine for extra work. We were fed by Brown and Root (the Army's civilian<br>contracting company who is the answer to malnutrition, scurvy, and an appetite), and had 2 hot<br>meals a day. That meant we were fed a hot breakfast and hot dinner. As much as people like to<br>complain about such things, the food wasn't all that bad. Everywhere we went, we went armed.<br>We usually carried a 9mm pistol in a shoulder harness, but when we took trips off base, we also<br>carried M16 A2 service rifles and M4 rifles.<br>(S) We were often traveling to Kabul. We had to pick up new analysts, occasionally go for<br>analyst exchanges, and conduct escort duty for the various trips undertaken by personnel from<br>the rest of the base. We also had the unique opportunity to travel to the Salang Tunnel with the<br>New Zealand detachment personnel. They were headed there, and we were afforded the<br>opportunity to tag along. It is supposed to be the highest tunnel in the world, and as a piece of<br>military history it is fascinating. It has been fought over by the Taliban, Northern Alliance,<br>Russians and most recently, the U.S.. All along the route up the mountainsides there are burned<br>out tanks and troop carriers left behind during previous conflicts.

It was<br>amazing to travel throughout the countryside. It is a very primitive and stark landscape. It was<br>beautiful in its own way.<br> <br>Salang Tunnel <br>(U) The biggest eye-opener I had was in observing how NSA deploys its personnel. I have been<br>deployed with the Marine Corps in the past, and it is a very different experience. It was nice to<br>know I was going to an established site. I was excited by the prospect of not having to bring the<br>equipment in, clean it up, pack it out and bring it home. <br><br>(U) As much as I missed my family and really wanted to see green grass again, when I looked<br>around Bagram that final morning prior to flying out, I was kind of sad. If there's one thing my<br>experiences deploying around the world have taught me, it's that these trips are ALL once-in-alifetime opportunities. Each one is a unique and exciting adventure.<br>(U//FOUO) Note: this article appeared on December 1st, 2003.
