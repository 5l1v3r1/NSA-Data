Designed to test the cryptologic system's capabilities<br>during a transition to war on the Korean Peninsula, this ROCK DRILL, the fourth in a series of<br>Korean-related exercises, focused on Phases 1 and 2 of OPLANS 5026 and 5027, which detail an<br>aggressive US/ROK reaction to a North Korean attack on South Korea. These recently-updated<br>OPLANS formed the basis of scenarios that stressed the cryptologic architecture in a variety of<br>ways. During three full days of work, the 70 ROCK DRILL participants may have failed to enjoy<br>the tropical sunlight, but they succeeded in proposing a variety of solutions to mitigate or close<br>gaps in NSA/CSS's ability to support USFK's newly unveiled Ten Critical Fights.<br>(S//SI) ROCK DRILL 4 was attended by NSA/CSS participants from South Korea, Japan, Hawaii<br>and Maryland as well as customers from around the world. BG John DeFreitas, US Forces Korea<br>(USFK) J2, set the tone by emphasizing that the need for collaborative yet candid discussions of<br>issues and resolutions. BG DeFreitas then framed the discussions for the ROCK DRILL by<br>detailing the Ten Critical Fights that that US/ROK Alliance needs to win in order to score a limited<br>victory (as in OPLAN 5026) or defeat North Korea completely (as in 5027). With this in mind,<br>the IMT, Military Integration Office (S13) and facilitator <br> (OPSIGINT) led the group<br>through a review and modification of the Cryptologic Support Plan and a large-group discussion<br>of the scenarios. On the third day, the session broke into small groups to discuss issues in the<br>categories of Collection, IT Infrastructure, Mission Management and Horizontal Synchronization<br>(how NSA/CSS plans fit with those of other national and tactical intelligence producers). At the<br>end, customer representatives from the State Department, USFK, and Pacific Command, the<br>Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency were given a chance to<br>comment on the process and the results, and all expressed excitement and optimism based on<br>what they had seen.<br>(S) After the ROCK DRILL, the Korea IMT and its core team, consisting of S13, OPSIGINT, and<br>our NCPAC hosts, met to match the week's accomplishments against its objectives, critically<br>analyze the exercise and to determine the way ahead. BG DeFreitas made a surprise visit to this<br>session and expressed gratitude for NSA's stupendous efforts and declared the ROCK DRILL a<br>success.<br>(S) However, for the ROCK DRILL to truly be a success, we must capitalize on this energy. The<br>Korea IMT is now in the process of digesting the material and will soon tag NSA/CSS people and<br>organizations with follow-on actions. Those tapped for actions should be aware that the tasking<br>deadlines will be aggressive. One of the salient points of OPLANs 5026 and 5027 is that it is<br>defensive and USFK cedes the initiative to North Korea - therefore, NSA/CSS has to be ready to<br>respond rapidly and on short notice -- North Korea's timeline, not ours.<br>(S) Next up for the Korea IMT is ROCK DRILL 5 (the US/ROK Alliance takes the offensive),<br>scheduled for 19-23 April in Seoul.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any questions, please feel free to contact<br>NSTS <br>, Tim Miner <br>@nsa, NSTS <br>), Liz Brooks (<br>) or <br> (<br>@nsa, NSTS <br>, the NK IMT.<br><br> (<br><br>nsa,<br>@nsa, NSTS<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
