(U//FOUO) STELLARWIND Classification Guide

(U) National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS): Classification Guide Number: 2-400
(U//FOUO) Project/Activity Name: STELLARWIND (STLW)

(U) Office of Origin: NSA/CSS Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID)

(U//FOUO) POC: William J. Amass, CT Special Projects
(U) Phone: 963-0087/963-0491 (s)

(U//FOUO) Classified By: Keith B. Alexander, Lieutenant General, United States Army, Director, National Security Agency.

(U) Declassify On: 25 Years*

(U//FOUO) Note: This guide provides classification guidance for information requiring marking and handling under the STELLARWIND special
compartment.

(TS//SI//NF) In Januaiy 2008, the Director of National Intelligence authorized certain information associated with STELLARWIND, as well as
related information authorized under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders (such as the Large Content Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) orders, Business Records (BR) FISA orders and the Pen Register Trap and Trace (PR/TT) FISA orders), to be removed from
the STELLARWIND compartment. This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classification instructions,
while classification guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an NSA/CSS FISA/Protect America Act
(PAA)/FISA Amendments Act (FAA) classification guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will
reference an NSA/CSS FISA/PAA/FAA classification guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by
the FISC. Also, this document references classification guidelines for FISA/PAA/FAA information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information
(ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classification. Additional Annexes are
provided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.

(TS//SI//NF) The markings “TSP” and “Compartmented” were at times used in briefing materials and documentation associated with the
STELLARWIND program. “TSP” and “Compartmented” were used primarily by the National Security Agency (NSA) Legislative Affairs Office
(LAO), NSA Office of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in briefings and declarations intended for external audiences, such as
Congress and the courts. The term “TSP” was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the

TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN

TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN

President in December 2005. These markings should be considered the same as the STELLAR WIND marking, but should not be directly
associated with the program. The identifier “STARBURST” was also used in the earliest days of the program and should also be considered the
same as “STELLARWIND.”
