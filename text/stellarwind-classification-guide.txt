Note: This guide provides classi?cation guidance for information requiring marking and handling under the STELLARWIND special
compartment.

In January 2008, the Director of National Intelligence authorized certain information associated with STELLARWIND, as well as
related information authorized under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders (such as the Large Content Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) orders, Business Records (BR) FISA orders and the Pen Register Trap and Trace ISA orders), to be removed from
the STELLARWIND compartment. This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classi?cation instructions,
while classi?cation guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an ISA/Protect America Act
Amendments Act (FAA) classi?cation guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will
reference an AA classi?cation guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by
the ISC. Also, this document references classi?cation guidelines for information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information
(ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classi?cation. Additional Annexes are
provided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.

F) The markings and ?Compartmented? were at times used in brie?ng materials and documentation associated with the
STELLARWIND program. and ?Compartmented? were used primarily by the National Security Agency (N SA) Legislative Affairs Of?ce
(LAO), NSA Of?ce of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in brie?ngs and declarations intended for external audiences, such as
Congress and the courts. The term was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the

FISA BR information currently marked STLW, court ordered access controls and classi?cation guidelines must continue to be observed. Users should note that
classi?cation guidance for information can be found in an guide.

F) For example, the AA classi?cation guide should be consulted when deriving classi?cation for FISA or FISA BR information
currently marked STLW such as:

ISA (initiated 17 July 2004)

1. FISA information collected, stored, processed under ISA authorization.

2. FISA targeting information - email address forms, query requests and approvals, selectors queried, query results, alert lists.
3. FISA PR/TT-related Mainway databases, realms data ?ows and all related technical data, collection statistics, and software.

4. FISA PR/TT-related working aids, brie?ng materials, query logs, etc.

F) BR FISA (initiated 24 May 2006)

1. FISA BR information collected, stored, processed under FISA authorization.

2. FISA BR targeting information - address forms, query requests and approvals, selectors queried, query results, alert lists, etc.
3. FISA BR?related Mainway Databases, realms data ?ows and all related technical data, collection statistics, and software.
4. FISA BR-related Working Aids, brie?ng materials, query logs, etc.

Documentation you have originated (memos, analytic summaries, etc.) - do not destroy/remove/delete. Please contact the SID PMO for questions.
Your records may constitute valuable temporary or permanent records and may be transferred to a designated of?cial or records of?cer, records include documents
created regarding STLW policies, decisions, procedures and essential operational, logistical and support transactions.

SIGINT Reporting -You are authorized to retain published reporting marked with the STLW caveat, however further dissemination of the

information contained in those reports must be coordinated through the SIGINT Intelligence Directorate Counterterrorism RF I process and accurately sourced to
the original STLW report number/title.

TO USA, FVEY) Other STLW information Record Retention Order - In addition to your obligations under Federal Records Act and NSA Policy,
you are reminded that Judge Vaughn Walker, USDJ, issued a Preservation order on November 6, 2007 relating to litigation challenging the surveillance activities
authorized by the President after the attacks of September 11, 2001. You should preserve and retain any (hardcopy or electronic including email) information,
documents or data that may be relevant to that litigation. If you have any questions about this obligation, you should contact your Of?ce of General Counsel.

F) NSA-generated materials submitted to a court in support of ongoing litigation which contains facts that reveal scope and scale of the Presidentially

Authorized Program should be handled as STLW. Note: Many litigation documents were marked as TSP instead of STLW. These documents, and supporting
facts, relate directly to the special authorization and remain STLW-compartmented.
