Intro; welcome; aims - legal framework and how to apply this in day-
to-day work

GCHQ operates within the law; everyone's responsibility; but we're
here to help

Training is part of that

But we also:

•Offer advice (desk, legal inbox, etc) - aim for prompt service; lawyers
always on hand as well;

•Deal with warrantry and disclosure

•Help shape new tools and applications

•Develop new policy as new requirements emerge, esp. with new
techniques, accesses etc that analysts want to exploit

Our job is to enable Sigint: we have processes that enable us to do
things that would be illegal to the man on the street

But with that comes responsibilities.

Legal Framework

Intelligence Services Act 1994

•	functions; property interference; oversight

Human Rights Act 1998

•	public authorities must act in accordance with ECHR

Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

•	interception; safeguards; oversight

Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006

fler ^^itqchqxtiXKV.uk

•	This is the legal framework that affect GCHQ Sigint operations and sets out
the 3 main Acts.

•	ISA - governs the functions of GCHQ

•	HRA - helps protect people's privacy in general NOT just their
communications eg people round Heathrow's new terminal feel their privacy
is being violated

•	it gained Royal Assent in 1998 but didn't come into effect until 2 October
2000 when RIPA was set up. •

• RIPA is the mechanism we use by which we make it ok to carry out
interception

• WTA covers interception of any wireless telegraphy not covered by RIPA

Background:

•	HRA was a manifesto commitment of the new labour govt in 1997 to allow people
under ECHR to pursue a case through the UK courts if grievance claim that their HR
have been interfered with, rather than taking it to Strasbourg

•	Royal assent - act on statute books - signed by Queen

•	RIPA 2000 covered for interception and surveillance - comms data provided for 5
January 2004

Intelligence Services Act

•	applies to all operations under control of
Director GCHQ

•	defines GCHQ's SIGINT function

•	prescribes purposes for SIGINT function:
... National Security

... Economic Well-being of the UK (EWB)

... Prevention/detectlon of serious crime

Until 1994, GCHQ and SIS did not have an act in law to define their
function.

BSS have the Security Services Act; ISA followed this.

Definition: to monitor or interfere with electromagnetic, acoustic and
other emissions and any equipment producing such emissions and to
obtain and provide information derived from or related to such
emissions or equipment and from encrypted material

Advice and assistance about languages (GLASS); and cryptography

Broad - covers passive collection; now also covers computer network
exploitation; rare to find something that it doesn't cover. BUT Act
does closely prescribe purposes for which GCHQ can exercise this
function. 3 purposes. Jonny stealing a Mars Bar example!

We are driven by customer requirements and need to make sure that
what we are asked to do falls within these 3 categories

(SC has four definitions, defined under RIPA).

This is the hard law; it's the basic starting point; once we have
established that work meets this, move onto other considerations.

Human Rights Act 1998

•	incorporates the ECHR into UK law

•	requires all UK public authorities to act in
accordance with the ECHR

•	allows actions against public authorities by
aggrieved parties

•	RIPA, ISA and WTA are the vehicles through
which ECHR or 'HRA compatibility' are met

ECHR: post WW2, nations combined to ensure atrocities didn't happen
again

•as a public authority it is unlawful for GCHQ to act in a way which is
incompatible with a convention right

• Public authorities are of 3 types:

-	government depts/health authorities/armed forces/police
(NOT parliament)

-	courts and tribunals

-	person/org carrying out functions of public nature (eg
Raiitrack when acting as safety regulator but not as commercial
property developer)

•	Some are absolute: eg. right to life, to protection from torture,
inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment

•	Some are limited eg. the right to liberty (unless you commit an
offence) and to a fair trial can be limited under expliat and finite
circumstances defined in the Convention itself.

•	Others are.....

Term HRA will be known to many of you if you target, use Corinth -
easy to forget that this is part of UK law

Point 3: compliance and oversight - more later

The European Convention on
Human Rights (ECHR)

Article 8 is of most obvious relevance to GCHQ:

x 8.1. “Everyone has the right to respect for his
private and family life, his home and his
correspondence. ”

x 8.2. ‘There shall be no interference by a public
authority with the exercise of this right except
such as is in accordance with the law and is
nenessarv in a democratic: societv ”

Obvious why relevant to GCHQ - examining forms of intercept; very
intrusive.

e.g. Heathrow night flights; partially successful.

8.2 is key - right to privacy is not absolute. Public authorities may
interfere with this if certain conditions are met.

Brings concept of proportionality into UK law for first time. Ends
must justify means; Sigint as last resort.

8

The European Convention on
Human Rights

• “...in the interests of national security, public
safety or the economic well-being of the
country, for the prevention of disorder or
crime, for the protection of public health and
morals, or for the protection of the rights and
freedoms of others. ”___

'Just' 3 at the moment. No reason why GCHQ's remit could not be
changed in future but this is what we are allowed to do at the
moment.

9

Need for authorisation

•	ensures compliance with requirements of
ECHR and HRA

•	SIGINT - intercept/CNE - is illegal in UK
without it (RIPA/CMA/WTA offences)

•	gives visibility of operational activities - to
GCHQ seniors & SoS

1.	Hard reason - criminal offence. Give example of journalist recently
jailed.

Civil servants are not immune from prosecution.

2.	Soft reason. Means that someone, usually SoS, makes a
judgement of proportionality and necessity.

3.	Policy.

•RIPA -

•	provides for interception and surveillance by public authorities since HRA came
into force

•	It focuses on rights of individuals located in the UK (regardless of nationality)
and provides for warrants to be issued to authorise interception of comms
(including comms outside UK)

•Point 2 - GCHQ could do this in law but hasn't to date; Joint Section work with
SIS; covered by their warrants.

•Point 3 - covers data direct from CSPs

•Also police, fraud office, anyone carrying out intercept

authorise 'at least one end foreign' interception

authorise selection according to Certificate
entries

target must be outside the UK (absent
additional authorisation)

ensure individuals' ECHR rights are protected

Selection of material governed by Certificate, speafying general
categories of material, rather than a specific individual/selectors.

Categories broadly mirror JIC requirements.

Slide 4 - individual's rights protected on world-wide basis; also allows
for anyone anywhere in the world to complain about our actions;
means we can demonstrate to Tribunal that we have acted lawfully.

RIPA warrants

the communications (usually CSPs)

RIPA makes no distinction based on nationality (cf. 2Ps); there'll be a
slide on this later.

The address can be a tel no or an email address ; warrant signed by
SoF but

Schedules can be modified by WLD (Whitehall liaison department) or
by a Director in an emergency

GCHQ - all current warrants are against premises rather than
individuals because of demarcation of responsibilities (us: foreign intel;
BSS - internal UK - although we may do intercept for them)

GCHQ - must have schedule served on it to target selectors on our
external warrant; see error report in legal inbox 26/10/2007.

Expand CSPs if not mentioned already - once served by a schedule,
have to comply with it (law). GCHQ can also be served by schedules.
GCHQ therefore insists on seeing copies of warrant schedules before
taking action because of previous muck-ups which have had to be
reported to the Commissioner. Involves simple, well-established
com ms process between OPP~ LEG and SS warrantry team.

Say: No schedule No targeting!

Address indirect targeting issues; will come onto UK issues

Indirect targeting - the use of a selector to identify and select the
communications of one individual with a view to selecting and
reporting the activities of another individual - the target; such targeting
requires an authorisation appropriate to the location and nationality of
the real target

Indirect targeting is getting sustained intelligence on A by targeting B.
(Wanting intelligence on B as well doesn't get you off the hook.)

Point to note: it is using another selector to get at the
communications of the target, not to find information about him.

So it is fine to target a Swedish girl-friend of a person in the UK to find
out info about him, as long as you defeat communications between the
two of them.

Revalidating targeting

•	make sure it is clear why you are continuing to
invade this person's privacy, so:

-	record your justification for continuing targeting

-	make sure all fields contain the most recent information
available

-	ongoing process

•	if you can no longer justify targeting, record your
reason for deactivating and then deactivate

Basis: data from authorised intercept, normally selected using a TND
but scope could include some unselected data, eg from a survey

Includes UDAQ (mixed), SAMDYCE (selected), DISHFIRE (mixed),
MAMBOOKIE (selected)

Issue: database users run queries and have potential to infringe
human rights of innocent people through reading their
communications

Normal A - J - P implemented by the analyst
Hence HRA screen

Also logging of queries for audit and queries (more later)
Querying is a form of targeting - hence STA requirement

Operational Legalities

Targeting: location and
nationality

Pick up from lawyer's words on territoriality.
RIPA - location - UK matters
Policies address nationality issues

Cause of a great many queries to OPP-LEG!

Location, location, location

Law: specific RIPA authorisation for
interception of a target located in the UK

Policy: internal authorisation (STA) for a target
outside the UK if nationality and/or location is
sensitive

all targets require HRA justification (gchq is a

public authority interfering with individuals' human rights)

Distinguish serendipity from indirect targeting. (Don't scare people off
doing valid and legal reporting)

Location = law

Nationality = policy

Any 2Ps in the audience?

Expand on Sensitive target - not covered later.

May wish to mention here policy that a target entering a Second Party
country must be detasked from all Second Party collection systems

42

Location?

• without other information, assume:

-	individual is in their country

-	mobile phone is in country of registration

-	email address with country digraph is there

this may vary - so should our response

•Not going into religion or philosophy - frequent topic of questions to

believing what you did.

• relies on honesty from analysts - in good faith

the decision - but do the best you can possibly do

Target arrives or is discovered
to be in the UK...what next?

Consider authorisation options

continuation targeting - RIPA s.16(5)

5 working days (1 for SC)
signed by GCHQ Directorate

then over to customer - RIPA s.8(l) warrant
or...

Target comes to UK - no longer have to take targeting off cover. In
fact we should probably be more interested in why a target has come
to the UK and want to do some work on this. There are other options.

16(5) - 5 days from moment analyst realises target is in UK (1 day for
SC). After this, need to apply for a warrant or drop targeting. Warrant
could have schedule served on us. 16(5) on 8(4) collection. Only
selectors you know about at the time, can't add new ones in.

45

Target in the UK...RIPA s.16(3)

frequent visitors to the UK or known targets

SoS signature required - modification to 8(4)
certificate

new selectors may be used

indirect targeting is not allowed

NB currently used only for counter-terrorism, serious crime, CP and Russian
intelligence officers (March 2008)

16(3) - you might know the name of the target; or it's a suspicious selector used
by one or more unknown targets; business case from IPT, goes through various
internal checks; OPP~LEG puts it into appropriate format -> SoS; renewed every 6
months (3 for SC); update it with current knowledge.

Directorate may authorise urgent additions

Indirect targeting - the use of a selector to identify and select the communications
of one individual with a view to selecting and reporting the activities of another
individual - the target; such targeting requires an authorisation appropriate to the
location and nationality of the real target

Indirect targeting is getting sustained intelligence on A by targeting B. (Wanting
intelligence on B as well doesn't get you off the hook.)

Point to note: it is using another selector to get the communications of the target,
not to find information about him. So it is fine to target a Swedish girl-friend of a
person in the UK to find out info about him, as long as you defeat communications
between the two of them.

e.g. Your target's in South Africa, his wife's in India. Targeting her phone no. to get
his com ms = indirect targeting, but is ok as long as you can demonstrate necessity
and proportionality. But if target comes from SA to UK, you'll need additional
authorisation to continue to target the wife's phone no.

46

If no authorisation is sought...

examine and report traffic intercepted up to
time you knew target was in UK ....then....

use B3M HRA'register'to alert

check location using events or THUGGEE

examine a cut (B3M / UDAQ) every 48 hrs to
check whereabouts

All this assumes they can't be bothered with any of the authorisation
options . Ask what this says about the level of justification of the
target in the first place.

Note no alert system on text repositories, only voice [and we don't
know how widely used the B3M mark up is used, tho I think it's
reasonably well known]

These days, esp for voice, call records are a better way of tracking
where someone is, and they're less intrusive

NB B3M flag only for target in the UK

Operational Legalities
SIGINT Development

By its nature, SD can be intrusive to many people's human rights, as it
can involve large-scale interception of many innocent people, cf.
interception using strong, known selectors with valid HRA
justifications.

SD - can be for technical development or to find target
communications from bulk data.

52

SD justification

•	Enhancing GCHQ's capabilities is a national
security purpose

•	TD - improving specific target knowledge,
identifying new sources etc - is justified by
the intelligence requirement for that target

Current ruling: content - moving towards metadata, need to flesh out
a few examples passwords to web sites are metadata; banking etc
would be content.

There are specific exemptions, eg PILBEAM, PRIMORDIAL SOUP, NEO
PUDDING (but getting to be too many exceptions for OPP~LEG liking)
