(U) Challenge: Integrating Tactical

& National Collection

•	(C//FVEY) Collection with HF/

VHF/UHF

-	Digital packets

-	Analog comms

-	Noise issues, lack of experience with
these types of signals

•	(C//FVEY) Tactical versus National
(Strategic) Collection

(U) Analytics for Targets in Europe

(C//FVEY) OPSEC Savvy Targets

•	“... most terrorists stop thru Europe

(TS//FVEY) Use advanced
techniques

•	Steganography

•	Forensics or Analytics on front end

•	Encryption

•	Takes time and has “black hole” issue

(TS//SI//FVEY) Reliance on
“special” collection

•	GCHQ and FAA

•	Problems processing w/r to TS

March 2012

(S//FVEY) 54% of current ECC DNI
tasking based on QFD data

(S//FVEY) QFDs provide better
access to metadata for European &
North African targets than any other
access at ECC due to poor passive
collection

( C//FVEY) Flexibility provided by
the use of TDIs and the first stage
query allows for better target
discovery and development

(U) “Real Time” Analytics

(U) Nascent Analytics with unclear definition of“real
time”

•	How fast is alerting?

(C//FVEY) DISTILLERY

•	Pulled from GHOSTMACHINE stack
(U) NIAGARAFILES

•	File based

•	Starting to gain experience
(C//FVEY) RTRG

•	Tools not integrated into ECC

•	Data Sets are sparse

•	Tactically oriented

•	Unregulated alerts can quickly spam user
(C//FVEY) ECC Current Effort:

•	Focused on NTOC and Distributed Denial of
Service attack alerting

(U) Batch: MapReduce Analytics

(U) Batch oriented versus streaming

•	Run every 15 min to once a day or so

•	Not streaming
(U) Good Data Storage

•	Good access outward to MDR-1, MDR-2

•	Days to years of storage

•	Promotion (?)

(U) Complex Analytics like “Pattern of Life”

•	Reasonable amount of processing cycles at the
front end collection system (not yet tested)

(U) Session can be quite long and still captured (not yet
tested)

(U) UUID’s (identifying sessions) are workable
(U) No experience yet sharing with second and third
party partners

(U) Unknown level of entry training required

(C//FVEY) Streaming

•	Data available one hour later?

•	Most do pulls up to yesterday
(U) Good Data Storage

•	RAW content: 3 days to a couple of weeks

•	Metadata: 90+ days
