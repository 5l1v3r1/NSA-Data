Slide taken from ECC archives.

54% of current ECC DNI
tasking based on QFD data

QFDs provide better
access to metadata for European 
North African targets than any other
access at ECC due to poor passive
collection

Flexibility provided by
the use of TDIs and the ?rst stage
query allows for better target
discovery and development

Pulled from GHOSTMACHINE stack
(U) NIAGARAFILES

Tools not integrated into ECC

Data Sets are sparse

Tactically oriented

Unregulated alerts can quickly spam user

(U) Batch: MapReduce Analytics

(U) Batch oriented versus streaming
Run every 15 min to once a day or so
Not streaming
(U) Good Data Storage
Good access outward to MDR-2
Days to years of storage
Promotion 
(U) Complex Analytics like ?Pattern of Life?
Reasonable amount of processing cycles at the
front end collection system (not yet tested)
(U) Session can be quite long and still captured (not yet
tested)
(U) (identifying sessions) are workable
(U) No experience yet sharing with second and third
party partners

(U) Unknown level of entry training required

(U) Key Take Aways

- Discovery in Africa is based on ?we
do not know what we do not see?

Unknown Unknown from url: 


- (U) Europe has Opsec savvy CT targets

- (U) Analytics involve partners
