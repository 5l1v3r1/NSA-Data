How To EXfiltrate 1P Packets

1. Make a copy of the captured packet.
2. Modify packet IP destination address.

3. Modify other protocol fields (1P, UDP, TCP) as
needed to bypass firewalls and tag packets for ID.

4. Optionally Transport layer payload.
5. Send modified Data Packet (DP) to new destination.

Receiver: Needs Metadata

- Metadata explains how to:

Identify an eXfil packet and the implant source.

Recover original IP destination address.

Recover other original protocol fields (IP, UDP, TCP).
Contains Key to transport layer payload.

- Metadata sent in a Session Announcement (SA)

- SAs use or sent to an IP/port.
- Multiple copies of SA sent to mitigate dropped SA packets.

- Receiver is dynamically configured with:
- SA IP/ports, Infrastructure 8: Implant Private Keys

Packet Cache Options

- CDR uses a 15 minute packet cache.

SAs are sent multiple times per session and the cache is searched for matching
DPs to mitigate dropped SAs.

- Simple Cache:

Use existing Turmoil cache (Delay Flow Control Engine).

- Large Cache:

Create a large cache that allows a 15 minute delay.

Options:
Start with Simple cache and see if we miss too many DPs. If problems then
implement Large cache.

Start with a Large cache and see if we can keep up with data rate 8: memory
requirements. If problems then scale back to Simple cache.

The hardware LightDelay provides a 30 second cache. 
The software provides a 2 second cache.
Pros:

Illu

1. 0 problems with buffering data since Turmoil does it automatically.
2. 0 work required to implement cache.

Cons:

1. Cache is much smaller than 15 minute (900 seconds 30X 30) CDR
requirement.


2. Cache delay is further reduced by unspecified latency to register new DP 
filters after receipt of SA.

3. Many DPs would be ignored if SA is missed/delayed.

Possibly "mitigated" by sending multiple SA copies in first 30 (or 2) seconds
of eXfil.

llIll
Implement large 15?minute packet cache within AEG.
Pros:
1. Meets CDR cache requirement. "In

2. Most/all DPs should be processed even if initial SA is missed/delayed.

Cons:

1. Violates normal Turmoil architecture. May not be possible/feasible to 
implement a large cache at typical Turmoil rates. 

2. Requires caching all IP packets sent to IP address", then manually
searching for DP hits instead of letting the PPF search packets.

3. Time/effort required to implement.
