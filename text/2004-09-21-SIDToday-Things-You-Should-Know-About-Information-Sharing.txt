DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Things You Should Know About Information Sharing<br>FROM: <br>Analysis &amp; Production Operations Staff (S204)<br>Run Date: 09/21/2004<br><br>(U) If the SIGINT system were a private company, what would it sell? Historically, our "product"<br>has been SIGINT reporting. But, crucial as this reporting is, in recent years it has become clear<br>that we have other "goods" of equal value to offer our customers -- things that have sometimes<br>been locked away inside our walls and fences. What kinds of things? -- our knowledge, our<br>insight, our data, and our accesses, to name a few. Now, the Agency and the larger Intelligence<br>Community have recognized the need to get every type of valuable information -- from<br>whatever source -- to those who can use it. The drive to make this happen is known as<br>"information sharing."<br>(U) Information sharing is one of the most important challenges we face as an Agency. Analysis<br>&amp; Production (A&amp;P), with the help of our Policy counterparts, has spent the past year making<br>substantive changes to policies and processes that stand in the way of partnering and<br>collaboration. At the same time, the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) has pioneered<br>other aspects of information sharing, specifically in implementing the "swimming upstream"<br>concept and new reporting and dissemination methods. Now the time has come to move from<br>pilot programs impacting only a few, to institutional changes that will affect all SIGINT analysts.<br>(U) The key to collaboration and partnering is to share intellectual capital. The Director has<br>provided the vision in his Transformation 2.0 initiative, and now additional guidance and policy<br>have been put into place to support that vision. The building blocks for information sharing are<br>laid. Now is the time for analysts to seek out close collaborative relationships -- with<br>counterparts wherever they may be -- that will help improve the country's security.<br>(U) Where can you find information on these changes in policies and processes? -- the<br>Information Sharing Webpage . To access it, just type "go infoshare." There you will learn<br>about:<br>ways we've enabled SIGINTers to collaborate with Intelligence Community partners;<br>how it's now easier to form partnerships both within and outside the Agency; and<br>how the new "dual authorities" concept will allow analysts to more readily form analytic<br>partnership cells.<br>(U) If you are a SIGINT analyst or manager, please take some time to review this important<br>information.
