Colombian Terrorist

FROM:

NSA TeXaSTranSnatiOnar Crime and Narcotics (FTS2F2)

Run Date: 05/16/2008

(S//SI//REL) SIGINTers have targeted Doris Adriana for 8 years; since 2004, they haveissued nearly 800 reports about her
activities as a key member of the FARC Colombian terrorist group.Recently SIGINT provided actionable intelligence that
resulted in her arrest...

Doris Adriana

(S//SI//REL) After 20 years as a member of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), Nancy
Conde Rubio (pictured), alias Doris Adriana, was arrested on 16 February 2008 while crossing the border
from Venezuela into Colombia. NSA/CSS Texas (NSAT) Transnational Crime and Narcotics (TCN) division produced
intelligence that directly contributed to the arrest of Adriana, the logistics and weapons coordinator for the FARC's 1st Front.

(S//SI//REL) She was also reportedly the girlfriend of FARC 1st Front Commander "Cesar," who is reputed to be holding
numerous high-value hostages, including three US citizens and former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt.
Adriana, a member of the FARC since the age of 16, is wanted by the U.S. on charges of cocaine trafficking and the
kidnapping of the three U.S. hostages. According to Colombian authorities, Adriana took over the 1st Front's narcotrafficking
activities after the arrest (and extradition to the US) of another prominent FARC member. Adriana has been a TCN target for
the past eight years, and nearly 800 SIGINT reports have been published on her activities since January 2004.

(S//SI//REL) NSAT/TCN discovered that Adriana was traveling from Venezuela to Colombia and produced a report indicating
she would be crossing the border without valid paperwork. This actionable intelligence was provided to the Bogota Embassy
Intelligence Fusion Cell (EIFC), which was then able (through the foreign release process ) to hand the information off to
Colombian military forces. TCN's reporting on the target gave Colombian authorities 24 hours of advance notice
that Adriana would be attempting a border crossing, critical intelligence needed to bring her into custody. With
her successful capture, TCN is now observing FARC units experiencing logistical difficulties and shortages in food, ammunition
and other supplies.
