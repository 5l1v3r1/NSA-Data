While UN peacekeeping in Sub-Saharan Africa has had mixed success, the missions<br>themselves are inevitable because seeking a peaceful resolution to crises and improving human<br>rights are precisely why the UN was created. With four UN peacekeeping missions already<br>underway in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,<br>the UN warned member states in December 2003 to be prepared to provide troops for additional<br>operations in Africa in 2004.<br>(U) Already a mission in Cote d'Ivoire has been approved and missions in Burundi, and Sudan<br>are being considered. In addition, Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping Operations JeanMarie Guehenno has noted that, "we may need substantial numbers of military personnel...to<br>ensure a robust and force-protected posture in the conduct of their operations."<br>(U) For the United States, UN peacekeeping operations in Africa claim a significant amount of<br>policymaker time and a sizeable amount of US funds. The four UN peacekeeping missions<br>underway in Sub-Saharan Africa have a combined annual budget of $1.9 billion-almost twice as<br>much as the cost of all other peacekeeping missions combined. The United States pays<br>approximately 27% of this bill-about $500 million. UN peacekeeping missions in Sub-Saharan<br>Africa are authorized to have more than 50,000 military and civilian personnel-five times more<br>than the number in any other region.<br>(U) The three new missions would put the cost of UN peacekeeping in Sub-Saharan Africa over<br>the $2 billion mark, with the United States probably picking up its 27 percent of the tab.<br>Moreover, donor fatigue from troop contributing nations is becoming more prevalent as many of<br>the current UN missions, both in Africa and elsewhere, still are not at full strength. The United<br>States therefore may face increased pressure in 2004 to contribute troops to at least one of the<br>proposed UN peacekeeping missions. Sudan is the most likely candidate, given the significant US<br>involvement in getting the warring parties to sign a peace accord.<br>(S) Assistant Secretary of State, International Organizations, Kim Holmes asserted during a<br>November 2003 visit to NSA that the Security Council spends more than 50 percent of its time<br>on African issues. This is particularly noteworthy when weighed against such critical issues as<br>Iraq and Afghanistan, which presumably consumed most of the Council's remaining time in<br>2003.<br>(S) Moreover, the peacekeeping proposals for the region that are brought before the Security<br>Council have significance for some of the Permanent Five (P-5) members (US, UK, China,<br>Russia, France) beyond the costs of such missions and the impact on the region. The historic<br>colonial ties between the UK and Africa and France and Africa give those two P-5 members more<br>of a stake in efforts to establish peacekeeping operations. China, for its part, is seeking to carve<br>out a role as "leader of the developing world" which, coupled with its growing economicespecially oil-investments in Sub-Saharan Africa, could lead this P-5 member to support<br>peacekeeping missions as a means of enhancing its stature with developing leaders in general<br>and African leaders in particular.<br>(U//FOUO) Crises in Africa, while not generally in the media spotlight, still claim a significant<br>portion of both US Government and United Nations time and resources. Future UN peacekeeping<br>operations in Sub-Saharan Africa are inevitable and the United States probably will face<br><br> </p>increased pressure to provide troops as well as funding in the near future.<br>(U//FOUO) POC: D/SINIO Global and Multilateral Issues,<br>@nsa,<br><br>,<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
