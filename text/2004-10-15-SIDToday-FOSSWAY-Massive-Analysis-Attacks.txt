DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(TS//SI) FOSSWAY: Massive Analysis Attacks<br>FROM: <br>Advanced Analysis Lab (S211)<br>Run Date: 10/15/2004<br><br>(TS//SI) Members from the 5-Eyes community met in a very successful Working Party led by the<br>Advanced Analysis Laboratory from 14 to 16 September 2004 to determine next steps in their<br>collaboration on the Fossway project. Fossway is dedicated to the development of massive<br>analytic attacks against global metadata supported by extensive automation.<br>(TS//SI) It will be a catalyst for developing analytic concepts of the future and proving the<br>practicality and benefits of these new concepts through real-world implementations. These<br>analytic attacks will be designed to extract communities of interest from global networks and<br>identify them and the processes in which they are engaged. Successful analytic attacks will<br>identify new targets, as well as maintain continuity on existing targets. Fossway will help focus<br>analysts on higher level tasks like hypothesis generation and assessment and will seek to<br>automate low level functions like data manipulation. Fossway prototypes will be fully functional<br>and demonstrate that the concepts are achievable. They will become forcing functions for the<br>global SIGINT enterprise to take up these new ideas aggressively and will enable contributions<br>from all organizations and activities both large and small.<br>(TS//SI) About 90 participants from NSA, CSE, DSD, GCSB, and GCHQ discussed wide-ranging<br>topics organized along four tracks: Analysis and Experimentation, Data Acquisition, Systems<br>Engineering, and Policy. The group's conclusions included agreements to increase analytic rigor,<br>build a common analytic lexicon, undertake joint challenge problems and experiments and<br>leverage prior and ongoing work throughout the SIGINT community, as well as across other<br>government, commercial and academic communities. The group further agreed to form a joint<br>working group to drive the joint experiments. The Working Party set a number of initial actions<br>to be completed within the next 3 months. These include establishing systems engineering<br>documentation, concepts of operations, data inventories, and policy position papers. A series of<br>experiments will also be documented and shared within the group. The Working Party resolved<br>to reconvene in May 2005 to review progress on Fossway.
