Example IP Profile Problem

Target appears on IP address, wish to understand
network context more fully

Example Quova look-up & response for

Lat. 60.00 Long: -95.00 (in frozen tundra W. of Hudson Bay)

City: unknown
Country: Canada,

Operator: Bell Canada, Sympatico

Issues with IP look-up data:

is it actually revealing, or is it opaque
is the data even current, or is it out-of-date
was the data ever accurate in the first place

TOP SECRET

Objectives

Develop new analytics to provide richer contextual
data about a network address

Apply analytics against Tipping & Cueing objectives

Build upon artefact of techniques to develop new
needle-in-a-haystack analytic - contact chaining
across air-gaps

TOP SECRET

Analytic Concept - Start with Travel Node

Begin with single seed Wi-Fi IP address of intl. airport

/

Assemble set of user IDs seen on network address
over two weeks

TOP SECRET

Profiling Travel Nodes - Next Step

Follow IDs backward and forward in recent time

Earlier IP clusters of:

-	local hotels

-	domestic airports

-	local transportation hubs

-	local internet cafes

- etc.

Later IP clusters of:

-	other intl. airports

-	domestic airports

-	major intl. hotels

-	etc.

TOP SECRET

IP Hopping Forward in Time

Follow IDs forward in time to
next IP & note delta time

Next IP sorted	1 Hr.

by most popular:

2 Hr.

I

3 Hr.

_____I

4 Hr.	5 Hr. A time

Many clusters will resolve to other Airports!

Can then take seeds from these airports and
repeat to cover whole world

Ditto for going backward in time, can uncover
roaming infrastructure of host city: hotels,
conference centers, Wi-Fi hotspots etc.

TOP SECRET

Data Reality

The analytic produced excellent profiles, but was more
complex than initial concept suggests

Data had limited aperture - Canadian Special Source

major CDN ISPs team with US email majors, losing travel coverage

Behaviour at airports

little lingering on arrival; arrivals using phones, not WiFi
still, some Wi-Fi use when waiting for connecting flight/baggage
different terminals: domestic/international; also private lounges

Very many airports and hotels served by large Boingo
private network

not seen in aperture; traffic seems to return via local Akamai node

TOP SECRET

Tradecraft Development Data Set

Have two weeks worth of ID-IP data from Canadian Special
Source -

Had program access to Quova dataset connecting into Atlas
database

Had seed knowledge of a single Canadian Airport WiFi IP

Mission Impact of IP Profiling

Tipping and Cueing Task Force (TCTF)

a 5-Eyes effort to enable the SIGINT system to provide real-time alerts of
events of interest

alert to: target country location changes, webmail logins with time-limited
cookies etc.

Targets/Enemies still target air travel and hotels

airlines: shoe/underwear/printer bombs ...

hotels: Mumbai, Kabul, Jakarta, Amman, Islamabad, Egyptian Sinai ...

Analytic can hop-sweep through IP address space to identify
set of IP addresses for hotels and airports

detecting target presence within set will trigger an urgent alert
aim to productize analytics to reliably produce set of IPs for alerting

TOP SECRET

IP Profiling Summary

Different categories of IP ownership/use show distinct
characteristics

airports, hotels, coffee shops, enterprises, wireless gateways etc.
clear characteristics enable formal modeling developments

clear identification of hotels and airports enables critical Tipping & Cueing
tradecraft

Geo-hop profile can confirm/refute IP geo look-up
information

later could fold-in time deltas for enhanced modeling

Can "sweep" a region/city for roaming access points to IP
networks

leads to a new needle-in-a-haystack analytic...

Tradecraft Problem Statement

A kidnapper based in a rural area travels to an urban area to
make ransom calls

can't risk bringing attention to low-population rural area
won't use phone for any other comms (or uses payphones ...)

Assumption: He has another device that accesses IP
networks from public access points

having a device isn't necessary, could use internet cafes, libraries etc.
he is also assumed to use IP access around the time of ransom calls

Question: Knowing the time of the ransom calls can we
discover the kidnapper's IP ID/device

"contact chain" across air-gap (not a correlation of selectors)

TOP SECRET

Solution Outline

With earlier IP profiling analytics, we can "sweep" a
city/region to discover and determine public accesses

We can then select which IP network IDs are seen as active
in all times surrounding the known ransom calls

reduce set to a shortlist

Then we examine the reduced set of IP network IDs and
eliminate baseline heavy users in the area that fall into the
set intersection just because they are always active

that is, eliminate those that are highly active outside the times of the ransom
calls

hopefully leaves only the one needle from the haystack

TOP SECRET

First Proof-of-Concept

Swept a modest size city and discovered two high traffic
public access ranges with >300,000 active IDs over 2 weeks

used for initial expediency due to computational intensity

Presumed that there were 3 ransom calls, each 50 hours
apart during daytime, looked for IDs within 1 Hr of calls

reduce large set to a shortlist of just 19 IP network IDs

Examined activity level of 19 IP network IDs - how many
presences each had in 1 Hr slots over two weeks

main worry as the computation was running: there would be a lot of IDs that
showed just a handful of appearances: e.g. 3, 4, 5 instances

Big-Data Computational Challenge

All the previous analytics, while successful experimentally,
ran much too slowly to allow for practical productization

CARE: Collaborative Analytics Research Environment

a big-data system being trialed at CSEC (with NSA launch assist)
non-extraordinary hardware

minimal impedance between memory, storage and processors
highly optimized, in-memory database capabilities
columnar storage, high performance vector functional runtime
powerful but challenging programming language (derived from APL)

Result of first experiments with CARE: game-changing

run-time for hop-profiles reduced from 2+ Hrs to several seconds
allows for tradecraft to be profitably productized

TOP SECRET

Overall Summary

IP profiling showing terrific value

significant analytic asset for IP networks and target mobility
enables critical capability within Tipping & Cueing Task force
working to productize on powerful new computational platform
broader SSO accesses/apertures coming online at CSEC
look to formalize models & fold-in timing deltas

A new needle-in-a-haystack analytic is viable: contact
chaining across air-gaps

enabled by sweep capability of IP profiling

should test further to understand robustness with respect to loosening
assumptions of target behaviour

beyond kidnapping, tradecraft could also be used for any target that makes
occasional forays into other cities/regions
