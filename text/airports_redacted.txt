Example IP Profile Problem

Target appears on IP address, wish to understand
network context more fully

Example Quova look-up response for 

Lat. 60.00 Long: -95.00 (in frozen tundra W. of Hudson Bay)
City: unknown

Country: Canada,
Operator: Bell Canada, Sympatico

Issues with IP look-up data:
is it actually revealing, or is it opaque
is the data even current, or is it out-of?date
was the data ever accurate in the first place

Objectives

Develop new analytics to provide richer contextual
data about a network address

Apply analytics against Tipping Cueing objectives

Build upon artefact of techniques to develop new
needle-in-a-haystack analytic contact chaining
across air-gaps

 

TOP SECRET


Analytic Concept Start with Travel Node

 

 

 

 

Begin with single seed Wi-Fi IP address of intl. airport



Assemble set of user IDs seen on network address
over two weeks

- local hotels - other intl. airports
- domestic airports - domestic airports
- local transportation hubs - majorintl. hotels
- local internet cafes - etc.

IP Hopping Forward in Time

Follow IDs forward in time to
next note delta time

 

 

 

 

 

 

Next sorted time

by most popular: 

Many clusters will resolve to other Airports!

Can then take seeds from these airports and
repeat to cover whole world

 

Ditto for going backward in time, can uncover
roaming Infrastructureoof host CIty: hotels,
conference centers, WI-FI hotspots etc.

Data Reality

 

 

 

 

The analytic produced excellent profiles, but was more
complex than initial concept suggests

Data had limited aperture Canadian Special Source
major CDN ISPs team with US email majors, losing travel coverage

Behaviour at airports
little lingering on arrival; arrivals using phones, not WiFi
still, some Wi-Fi use when waiting for connecting flight/baggage
different terminals: domestic/international; also private lounges

Very many airports and hotels served by large Boingo
private network
not seen in aperture; traffic seems to return via local Akamai node

Hop Geo Profile From CDN Airport lntl. Terminal

 

 

 

 

 

Long Longitude scale is non-linear
most far-flung sites are wireless gateways

awith many other wireless gateways in set a


Profiled/seed IP location: Square geographic location

Hopped-to IP location: height numbers of unique hopped-to IPs at location

Plot of where else IDs seen at seed have been seen in two weeks
Plot shows most hopped to are nearby - confirming reported seed geo data



 

 

TOP SECRET


Effect of Invalid Geo Information

 

 

 

 

Long Longitude scale is non-linear 
a Geo Incongruence:


displacem of seed location

from distri ution center

strongly su gests data error

 

  

 

Profiled/seed IP location: ISquare geographic location

Hopped-to IP location: ririne height numbers of unique hopped-to IPs at location

Effect of invalid seed geo informationbreadily apparent

Domestic terminal
Closeness of majority of hopped-to IPs confirms geo data

But, domestic airport can also look like a busy hotel
