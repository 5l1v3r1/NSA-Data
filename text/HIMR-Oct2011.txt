What I will cover





Finding operational closed loops:

-	The reality of target behaviour

-	The process of looking for closed loops

-	Some statistics on a large graphs components

-	A real life example

-	Cheap and disposable handsets

-	Catching targets for real

- What Donald Rumsfeld taught me about closed loops

What is a closed loop?

•	A set of (for example) phones that communicate
only amongst themselves as a means of
communications security

•	This is generally speaking too loose a definition
for practical purposes

Tightening up the
definition of a closed loop

• A component on three or more nodes that is
neither the giant component nor a tree

Work on this topic since

2005

•	GCHQ initially interested in topic following use of a closed
loop by the July 7, 2005 bombers

•	Analysis of anonymised meta-data for bulk UK-UK mobile
call records indicated that this was a rare phenomenon
and pointed to possible target discovery opportunities

•	Closed loop analysis of VOICESAIL showed promise but
work was truncated

•	SANAR-08 presentation demonstrated that operational
closed loops could in theory be discovered

The reality of target
behaviour

•	Targets from different IPT's regularly purchase
groups of cheap mobile phones and use them
operationally for a short period (possibly as long
as three months) before getting a new set

•	Two critical features:

-	Most of the phones start life at about the same time

-	Most of the phones are cheap handsets

•	Sometimes the targets make a mistake and make
a call to a phone outside the closed loop

The process of looking
for closed loops f

•	Choose a time window (e.g. 10 days)

•	Clean up the data for that period

•	Componentize the graph

•	Extract the components that fit the closed loop
definition

The effect of windowing

•	We need to window the data or else slip ups by
the closed loop members will render the group
invisible

•	Need to choose a window that is large enough to
allow the giant component to form but not so
large that we never see targets who periodically
goof up.

Some statistics about
components

•	1507405 edges and 1606330 nodes

•	922135 nodes in the giant component (57%)

•	222477 components, of which 218327 (98.1%)
are trees

•	4149 non-tree, non-giant components, involving
39927 nodes (2.5% of total)

•	17 of these components had at least 70% of the
nodes illuminating within a 3 week period.

When geolocation is not

enough...

•	Targets love cheap handsets, bless 'em

•	Nokia occupy the largest segment of the cheap
phone market. Nokia 1 * phones are nasty.

Nokia 1616

"Unashamedly aimed at the bottom end of the
mobile phone spectrum... under the bonnet things
remain distinctly unimpressive"

TOP SECRET STRAP1

Vodafone 252

"A very affordable handset that comes with basic
voice call and message services"

TOP SECRET STRAP1

Samsung 1150

"This cut-price phone offers bare-bones
functionality and lacks what many mobile users
would deem to be essential features"

Testing the cheap phone

hypothesis

• What type of handset did the July 7, 2005 London
bombers use?

• At least three of the four phones used on that day
were a Nokia 1100
