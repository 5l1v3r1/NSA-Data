Context-Aware Tagging £

•	Provides for the ability to task and scan
for terms only when they appear inside
the body of documents like Microsoft
Office or Adobe PDFs

•	EX: We want to find technical
documents regarding WIMAX networks
but tasking the term 'WIMAX' to
Cadence would flood PINWALE with
hits. What if we only look for the term
within documents?
