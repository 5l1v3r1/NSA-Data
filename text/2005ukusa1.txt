a) (S//SI//NF) Under the British-U.S. Communications Intelli-
gence Agreement of 5 March 1946 (commonly known as the United
Kingdom/United States of America (UKUSA) Agreement), both gov-
ernments agreed to exchange communications intelligence prod-
ucts, methods and techniques as applicable so long as it was not
prejudicial to national interests. This agreement has evolved to
include a common understanding that both governments will not
target each other’s citizens/persons. However, when it is in the
best interest of each nation, each reserved the right to conduct
unilateral COMINT action against each other’s citizens/persons.
Therefore, under certain circumstances, it may be advisable and
allowable to target Second Party persons and second party commu-
nications systems unilaterally when it is in the best interests of the
U.S. and necessary for U.S. national security. Such targeting must
be performed exclusively within the direction, procedures and deci-
sion processes outlined in this directive.
