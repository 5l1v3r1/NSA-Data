Hayden and the Extended<br>Enterprise leadership on 19 April 2005 of the potential dangers stemming<br>from the ongoing situation in Lebanon. We also shared this SINIO<br>Advisory with the National Intelligence Officer for Warning and the<br>Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Collection. In the wake of<br>Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon, the anti-Syria opposition has gained<br>momentum, but the effort to form a new government has met serious<br>challenges. If the new government cannot hold parliamentary elections by<br>the end of May, a simmering climate for instability in the fragile country<br>may boil over into a violent power struggle.<br>(U) Recent months' events in Lebanon continue their overall slide toward<br>a potential crisis. Pro-Syrian Prime Minister (PM)-designate Omar Karami,<br>unable to form a new government after nearly 7 weeks of deadlock,<br>stepped down for a second time on 13 April and moderate Najib Mikati<br>was appointed acting PM on 16 April. Mikati quickly formed a government<br>empowered to hold critical parliamentary elections by the end of May, but<br>its stability is questionable -- the Education Minister resigned on 21 April<br>without explanation. Syrian claims that its hasty withdrawal from<br>Lebanon, in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR)<br>1559, would precipitate a security crisis could still be borne out, and<br>provide justification for Syria to redeploy in response to a Lebanese<br>"request" for Syrian assistance to restore order. While unlikely, the worstcase scenario presents a threat to Lebanon-Israel border security and<br>would deal a blow to the Administration's Greater Middle East Initiative if<br>Lebanon's drive to throw off the Syrian yoke is thwarted.<br>(U) Since the September 2004 adoption of UNSCR 1559, anti-Syria<br>oppositionists have gathered momentum. Opposition elements in the<br>Lebanese government, sectarian leaders, and supporters from the<br>populace were mobilized, to a degree, and governmental changes began<br>to alarm Damascus. The 14 February assassination of former PM Rafiq<br>Hariri appeared to be the last straw for those opposed to the Syrian<br>presence and who held Syria responsible for Hariri's death. Tens of<br>thousands demonstrated in Beirut, demanding that Syria quit Lebanon,<br>but a Hizballah-staged counter rally drew an estimated 1 million<br>supporters who clamored for Syria to remain. International pressure<br>prompted Syria to implement a withdrawal, which President al-Asad<br>assured the UN would be complete prior to May elections. Failing to form<br>a government, Karami resigned in late February, but was reappointed on<br>9 March, a sign of Damascus' continued control over Beirut. The<br>appointment of Mikati, a moderate pro-Syrian legislator and confidante of<br>Syrian President Bashar al-Asad, came as a compromise on the part of the<br>opposition, aimed at salvaging the election schedule.<br>(S//SI) The SIGINT system is responding to these events, but stands to<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) SINIO<br>Council<br>Intelligence Issues <br>1.
