Charlie Meals, the Signals Intelligence Deputy Director, was the driving force behind the<br>creation of this award. Here's what he had to say about it:<br> <br>SID Distinguished Service Award <br>(U) What led you to create this award?<br>A: (U) SID leadership felt that we needed a distinctive way of showing our appreciation to our<br>people, civilian or military, who have made great contributions to SID and its mission. SID<br>personnel have been doing incredible work, and I expect no shortage of worthy candidates!<br>Although there are Defense Department-level awards to honor distinguished service, this award<br>will be granted by the Signals Intelligence Director for achievements related specifically to<br>SIGINT.<br>(U) What form does the award take?<br>A: (U) It's a gold metal clock with a cover displaying the SID logo. We think recipients will be<br>very pleased with it.<br>(U) What are the criteria for bestowing this award?<br>A: (U) Any SID employee -- at any grade level or rank -- who has made an extraordinary<br>contribution to SID can be considered for this award. This may be an individual or team award.<br>Managers will submit the nominations and the Signals Intelligence Director will make the<br>selections. (Although this is not a "peer" award, I do encourage coworkers to speak up and tell<br>their management that they believe a specific person or team is deserving.) I ask SID leaders to<br>keep this award in mind as a potential way of rewarding outstanding performers -- we want<br>them to know their efforts are appreciated!<br>(U) Nominations can be made at any time.
