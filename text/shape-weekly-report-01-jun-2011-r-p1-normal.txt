SHAPE Weekly Report on NATO-led Operations

INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE (ISAF) - AFGHANISTAN

1.	With the poppy harvest coming to a close, the expected increase in INS activity is
steadily materializing. The past week saw a number of incidents, including the 24 May
11 failed attempt by INS to take over the Do Ab District Centre (Nuristan Province,
RC(E)), the 26 May 11 Kandahar IED strike that killed eight USA ISAF soldiers and the
28 May 11 remote-controlled IED in the Governor’s Palace in Taloqan District (Takhar
Province (RC(N)) that killed the Regional Chief of Police LTG Daoud Daoud and
wounded the RC(N) commander, MG Kneip. The Taloqan attack is the latest in a series* 1
of high profile attacks in RC(N), targeting senior provincial GIRoA figures.

2.	The 19 May 11 spike in INS activity in RC(SW) reported in last week’s SHAPE
Weekly effectively marked the beginning of the fighting season. However, despite the
incidents mentioned in Paragraph 1. Regional Commands continue to report INS activity
below normal levels for the Spring period. For example. RC(N) noted that the INS are
focusing on defending their remaining area of operations against ANSF and ISAF instead
of executing offensive operations. Intelligence indicates that although some INS leaders
are planning to retake key terrain to regain some influence, they also fear a possible
ISAF and ANSF reaction should they expose their fighters.

3.	RC(SW) provided some interesting and encouraging insights into the 19 May spike
of incidents in Helmand. It appears the INS had planned to execute a three day
offensive but required rest and refit after just one day of operations. Also, unlike previous
operations, the Taliban (TB) leadership was closely involved in the tactical planning and
the execution of the attacks. This is a possible indication of low level commanders

1	On 8 Oct 10,10 Feb 11, 21 Feb 11.10 Mar 11 and 14 Mar 11 IED attacks targeted key GIRoA personnel
in RC(N). killing among others the Kunduz Provincial Chief of Police and the Kunduz Provincial Governor.
