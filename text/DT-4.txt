(U) The Death of Anwar Nasser Aulaqi

(TS//NF) Anwar Nasser Aulaqi, a dual U.S./Yemeni citizen, regional
commander for AQAP, and well-known extremist lecturer who preached at two
U.S. mosques attended by some of the September 2001 hijackers, was killed in
Yemen on 30 September 2011. The CIA tracked Aulaqi for three weeks before
a joint operation with the U.S. military killed Aulaqi. The special operation
killed four operatives, including Samir Khan, another American who played a
key role in inspiring attacks against the U.S. Aulaqi's death represents another
integrated CIA and military success in the counterterrorism fight.
