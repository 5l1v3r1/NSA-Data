Current Capability

Supporting Internet Operations

•	Following the efforts made for the July deliverable, and
the progress being made towards the 100 March 2010
target, GCHQs current 10G SSE capability is:

-	We can intercept/touch: -800x 10Gs (See note ri)

-	We can cyclic survey: 188

-	We can egress to GCHQ processing: 87 (See note #2)

•	In addition we are working with GERONTIC to agree an
IRU which will enable a significant reduction in annual
running costs (~£2M saving p.a), along with a further 10x
10G egress.

Note #1. Does not include CIRCUIT/WAYGOOD

Note #2. HIASCO access/egress to Bude complete - awaiting extra ARCANO egress
