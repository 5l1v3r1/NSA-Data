DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Update on the Knowledge System Prototype -- It's in the BAG!<br>FROM:<br>Chief, Knowledge Systems, Advanced Analysis Lab (S211K)<br>Run Date: 04/23/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>Chief, Knowledge Systems, Advanced Analysis Lab (S211K) <br>(U) We ran an article back in September 2003 on the development and status of the Knowledge<br>System Prototype (KSP), aka "the BAG." A lot has happened in the program since then, so we<br>thought it would be a good idea to give everybody an update.<br>(S//SI) Background : The Knowledge System Prototype (KSP) was initially envisioned as a<br>four-year advanced technology demonstration program. The initial KSP prototype was delivered<br>in March 2002, and a second, improved prototype was delivered in March 2003. The current<br>version of the KSP recognizes 300+ different concepts and relationships, has been linked to<br>dozens of disparate open source and SIGINT data sets, and can rapidly correlate and display<br>billions of instances from these data sets.<br>(S//SI) "Challenge Problems" - Moving towards operations : The second KSP prototype<br>provided us a basic technical capability. While we are continuing technical development work,<br>the delivery of the second prototype allowed us to start looking much harder at just how the<br>KSP capability would be used in operations. To explore this question, we have initiated a series<br>of "challenge problem" with Analysis &amp; Production (S2) product lines. Specifically, we have asked<br>A&amp;P analysts to attempt to use the KSP to work on real analytic problems using real target data.<br>We use what we learn from these problems to drive further development of the system. Our first<br>"challenge problem" demonstrations were completed back in November 2003 with analysts for<br>the Proliferation and Arms Control Office (S2G) showing how they could use the KSP to identify<br>middleman "cut-outs" between suspected arms traffickers. This month, analysts from the<br>Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support Office (S2D) are demonstrating their use of the KSP on<br>a variety of analytic tasks. We have about twenty additional "challenge problems" lined up that<br>we hope to get to over the next eighteen months.<br>(S//SI) "Demonstration Deployments" - Moving further towards operations : We are<br>also looking at a few deeper operational applications for the KSP via what we call<br>"demonstration deployment." The biggest of these will be an end-to-end deployment of the KSP<br>into the National Security Operations Center (NSOC). The idea is to integrate all data sources<br>coming into NSOC and all applications used by NSOC into the KSP to gain knowledge about how<br>this improves NSOC's ability to monitor and control the SIGINT system. Work on this task<br>started in January. Another demonstration deployment we are planning is with the new SIGDEV<br>Data/Network Operations Center (DNOC). The goal is integrate data sources and applications via<br>the KSP and then learn how this impacts DNOC's ability to understand and exploit the global<br>network. Two additional "demonstration deployments" are underway or planned with other<br>program. The first is with Project MAINWAY to provide a rapid telephone chaining query<br>capability to a small group of CT analysts. The second is with the Advanced Analysis Lab's<br>FOSSWAY Project where we are ingesting open-source data sources provided by FOSSWAY to<br>"enrich" SIGINT. FOSSWAY will then use this enriched SIGINT to develop advanced traffic<br>categorization and characterization tools to attack the "unknown unknowns" problem.<br>(S) "Technology Thrusts" : While we are doing a lot of interesting work with operational<br>elements, the KSP is still a prototype and still needs to develop technically. In addition to what<br>we learn from the challenge problems and demonstrations deployments, we are also sponsoring<br>a series of "technology thrusts" to identify, evaluate, compare, and demonstrate advanced<br>technologies of potential value to KSP program. Current or upcoming efforts include work on<br>entity extraction tools, entity naming, belief maintenance systems, metadata registries, graph<br>query languages, database evaluations, conceptual graph generators, and terminology<br>management systems.<br><br> </p>(S//SI) Preparing for the future : Finally, we are planning for success by taking the steps<br>necessary to make the KSP a robust system available to support all of operations. Specifically,<br>we have brought in additional support to develop and implement configuration management,<br>help desk, training, website, and system documentation. We have signed long-term maintenance<br>agreements for key KSP hardware and software components. We have taken action to ensure all<br>commercial hardware and software used in the KSP is on the NES-Baseline. We have arranged<br>space in the <br> mission assurance facility . We are moving one of existing KSP systems<br>(there are two) to the SERVERWORLD facility where it will have 24/7 ITIS support as well as an<br>UPS connection. In conjunction with TRAILBLAZER, we just purchased our next-generation KSP<br>hardware platform, a Silicon Graphics ALTIX 3700. The Altix is the largest memory system ever<br>built by Silicon Graphics and, to our knowledge, is the first high-performance, large-memory,<br>scalable system specifically tailored to support Analysis &amp; Production missions. Not stopping<br>there, we are already talking with industry leaders to plan moving us up to even bigger and<br>more capable hardware platforms.<br>(U//FOUO) Learn more : For those of you interested in learning more about the KSP, we hold<br>open briefings and demonstrations in the Advanced Analysis Lab Conference Room (2N039-1)<br>every other Friday from 1100-1200. The next scheduled briefing is 14 May.
