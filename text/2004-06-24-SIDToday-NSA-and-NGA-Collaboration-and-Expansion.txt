NGA's presence at NSA has expanded from three to 78<br>personnel over the last several years. This expansion includes Geospatial Analysts, Imagery<br>Analysts and support personnel at Headquarters as well as the Extended Enterprise to include<br>the Regional Security Operation Centers.<br>(C) Conversely, NSA has expanded its presence within the NGA footprint. Historically, NSA has<br>had one Representative position at NGA for over 37 years. Now, NSA has increased its footprint<br>from one to nine. These positions include both liaisons as well as analysts integrated within the<br>NGA Production Directorate. These integration efforts have contributed to increased awareness,<br>cooperation and partnering between the two agencies.<br>(TS//SI//REL) NGA Integrees have served with the Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) from its<br>earliest days. An early example of this ongoing collaboration was the support given to a Combat<br>Search Air Rescue (CSAR) effort in Afghanistan for a downed US helicopter during Operation<br>ANACONDA in February 2002. NGA Integrees quickly located imagery of the downed helicopter,<br>which assisted GEO personnel in plotting SIGINT activity associated with the Taleban forces near<br>the crash site. This information was fed to forward tactical elements for targeting consideration.<br>Air strikes were directed against these sites, which cleared the way for the rescue helicopter to<br>retrieve the survivors.<br>(C) As the capabilities and awareness matured, we have found new benefits to include:<br>Greater context for intelligence analysis : use Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) as<br>context for SIGINT intercept and SIGINT as context for GEOINT<br>Cross-cueing between INTs : apply each other's INT to enable more precise, dynamic<br>tasking and analysis<br>Revealing high value intelligence : use each INT to discover information that might<br>otherwise not be recognized for its full intelligence value separately<br>Fused reporting : provide a more coherent representation of disparate components of<br>SIGINT and GEOINT to intelligence customers<br>Leveraging expertise : identify and share areas of expertise for mutual benefit<br>including tools, techniques, and knowledge<br>Discovery of organizational touch points : quickly identify individuals, organizations,<br>and mission elements to pass on high priority intelligence finds and collaborate on<br>customer needs<br>Synchronization against the national priorities : improve transparency of operations<br>to ensure an optimal balance of resources is applied by each agency against the nation's<br>most critical needs<br>(U) NGA and NSA have created partnerships that bring together the talents and expertise of<br>both agencies in all contexts and disciplines. These capabilities reflect a progression toward the<br><br> </p>shared vision of the Directors of both NSA and NGA.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>NGA was formerly known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
