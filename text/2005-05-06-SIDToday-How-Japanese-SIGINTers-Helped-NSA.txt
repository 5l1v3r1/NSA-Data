(S//SI) How Japanese SIGINTers Helped NSA

translate into success for the United States Cryptologic System (USCS).

Collection of the 
 signal allowed us to identify the transmitting 
 and to DF* the
user, which provided location, although the text of the communications was unreadable. Many
organizations in the Intelligence Community were the beneficiaries of the related intelligence,
and especially PACOM* for its mission

 The next month, representatives from
NSA Headquarters and KRSOC* quickly visited the DFS to confirm the find. The signal was
confirmed as the successor to

capability developed and deployed.
(S//SI) We're now able to recognize, collect, demodulate and decode the signal, as we could the
 signal. While the underlying text remains enciphered and unreadable, as was
we're able to distinguish valid messages from practice/test messages through traffic analysis of
message externals. Also, we're once again able to identify the

enjoying greater success in DF-ing the transmitter.
(S//SI) In honor of DFS's discovery, NSA deferred to DFS in the naming of the new signal. The

(S//SI) This event highlights the benefits reaped by the USCS and the Intelligence Community
through NSA's SIGINT partnerships. The DFS discovery and subsequent NSA-DFS collaboration
have allowed us to continue to provide the Intelligence Community, and particularly PACOM,
with intelligence related to a

Theater.
