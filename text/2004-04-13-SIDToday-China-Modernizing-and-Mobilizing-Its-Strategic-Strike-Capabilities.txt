After two decades of<br>development, China's Dongfeng-31 (East Wind-31 or DF-31) is on<br>the verge of batch production. While this 8000-kilometer range<br>missile cannot target the continental United States, the DF-31 will,<br>however, be capable of striking targets from Moscow to Alaska.<br>The follow-on missile, the DF-31A, will have the range to target the<br>entire United States.<br>(S//SI) This 12,000-14,000 kilometer range missile has had two<br>successful flight tests, and further testing is expected.<br>Accompanying the development of these land-based missiles is<br>that of the Julang-2 (Great Wave-2 or JL-2) submarine launched<br>ballistic missile. The DF-31 ICBM is likely serving as a technology<br>bridge for both the DF-31A and JL-2 programs.<br>(S//SI) Although China will not produce mobile ICBMs in the<br>quantity Russia has, China is seeking to establish a credible and<br>survivable nuclear deterrent, and will likely adhere to its longstanding "no first use" policy. The current ICBM system in China<br>that can target the United States, the DF-5A, is a liquid propellant<br>system based in silos. These missiles are considered vulnerable to<br>attack and less survivable than a mobile system.<br>(S//SI) Assessments vary regarding the status of the various<br>Chinese mobile ICBM programs due to different readings of<br>available intelligence. However, most analysts believe the DF-31<br>ICBM will be deployed in limited numbers in the next few years,<br>followed shortly thereafter by the more capable DF-31A ICBM. The<br>launch platform for the JL-2 SLBM, the 094-class nuclear powered<br>ballistic missile submarine, is currently under construction. We<br>expect that the JL-2 SLBM will be deployed by the end of the<br>decade.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) SINIO<br>Council Intelligence<br>Issues <br>1.

New facilities<br>for solid rocket motor production, general assembly, flight testing,<br>and deployment have been completed or are still under<br>construction. China is clearly establishing an infrastructure for long<br>term and sustainable mobile ICBM production that promises to be a<br>continued source of concern to the Intelligence Community.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
