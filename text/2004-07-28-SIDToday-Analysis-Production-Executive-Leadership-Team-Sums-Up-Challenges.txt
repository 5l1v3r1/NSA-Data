DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Analysis &amp; Production Executive Leadership Team Sums Up<br>Challenges<br>FROM: Jim Allen<br>Deputy Director, Analysis &amp; Production<br>Run Date: 07/28/2004<br>(U) We made important progress, last week, toward realizing the Director's vision of a<br>transformed global enterprise. We convened a meeting of the A&amp;P Executive Leadership Team to<br>address strategic issues, to include governance, resources, hiring, training, and operational<br>issues. We made good headway on all.<br>(U//FOUO)The A&amp;P ELT is comprised of:<br>DDAP, Jim Allen<br>A/DDAP,<br>A/DD for Production, <br>Chief, Production Services, <br>GRSOC Commander, Colonel Rob Carr, USA<br>KRSOC Commander, Captain<br>, USN<br>MRSOC Commander, Colonel <br> USAF<br>Chief of Staff, <br>Chief of Operations and Chairman of PMC, <br>A&amp;P Tech Director, Jack Israel<br>(U) Composition may be adjusted a bit as we go forward, but the ELT is the most senior body in<br>A&amp;P. This is not the first time we've done business, but it is the first time we've had the entire<br>ELT together to conduct it's primary functions. <br>Which are to:<br>define major mission areas,<br>apportion resources across mission areas,<br>set strategic direction for and priorities of A&amp;P activities worldwide,<br>produce standards and goals,<br>set architecture and technology investment,<br>set personnel hiring and development targets,<br>establish measurement and assessment, and<br>achieve synchronization with rest of the corporation.<br>(U) The ELT agreed that Product Line Leaders (PLL's) will:<br>determine distribution of analytic effort within and across a major mission area,<br>apply resources within mission areas,<br>ensure adherence to standards and goals,<br>assess and adjust distribution of analytic effort,<br>identify production gaps that may be satisfied through partnerships,<br>develop roadmaps/processes to achieve goals in work force strategy for the specific<br>mission area,<br>drive requirements for uniform interoperable functional capabilities, and<br>manage effective expenditure of resources within the mission area.<br>(U) This clarity is helpful, but we still have work to do in redefining our terminology and<br>operating concepts. For example, PLL and Production Manager are today almost synonymous,<br>and they are usually identified with the idea of a "Target Office of Primary Interest, (TOPI)"<br>which conjures an image of a set of people behind a particular door vice a distributed analytic<br>community. Organizations are evolving, but not fast enough to keep up with the way we are<br>operating.<br>(C) A&amp;P has already and will continue to enjoy much of the growth in NSA/CSS's population over<br><br> </p>the next few years. If current plans stay on track, we could reach as many as 8200 members by<br>the end of FY09. The time to think about the skill sets, geographic distribution, and other<br>questions is now. Our intention is to base the answers to those questions on mission to the<br>maximum extent possible. PLL's will propose a strawman at the next ELT, probably by the end of<br>August, which will ultimately result in recommendations from us, initially to the SIGINT Director.<br>(U) Simultaneous with the strategic planning effort, we are identifying actions we need to take<br>now and next year to move mission to other parts of the enterprise or to augment missions<br>already there. I'll provide more detail on those initiatives when I have enough meaningful detail,<br>but among the early actions will be steps to shore up our global effort against Counterterrorism<br>and Counterproliferation -- quickly.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
