DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) More on SCOR<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 11/29/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) Last week, I told you about our need to create the environment to foster and enable<br>a net-centric SIGINT System for the United States that is based on Common Operating Picture<br>(COP) and a collaborative, global decision-making process. In that article, I focused on the<br>investments to infrastructure that are needed to facilitate that change. Building such an<br>environment will require more than infrastructure - it will also need a new model of governance.<br>(U//FOUO) Prior to the SCOR Conference, the SID Leadership had identified the DIRNSA's 17<br>major responsibilities for the SIGINT leadership . In addition, we had determined that SID is<br>primarily responsible to the DIRNSA for the first 4 responsibilities (we have an important role in<br>the execution of the other 13, but many of these are led by NSA corporate-level partners). We<br>had already developed and implemented processes for the first 3 responsibilities, which can be<br>grouped under the major governing task called "Produce SIGINT for the Nation". These three<br>responsibilities drive Responsibility #4, which we have labeled "Direct and Operate the US<br>SIGINT System." Responsibility #4, in turn, drives or influences all of the other 13<br>Responsibilities. The goal of the SCOR Conference was to have a workshop with the leaders from<br>across the U.S. SIGINT System that would begin developing and documenting processes for<br>Responsibility #4.<br>(U//FOUO) The discussions over the three days were open, frank, enlightening and encouraging.<br>We are far enough along in our thinking to publish the SID Management Directive Number 411<br>dealing with responsibilities at the strategic level for governance of the U.S. SIGINT System. In<br>addition, within the next several weeks, I will draft a more detailed plan for strategic governance<br>of Responsibility #4. These documents are critical, because they will drive the development of<br>similar processes and governance mechanisms in all elements of the U.S SIGINT System.<br>(U//FOUO) Meanwhile, we will continue to put into place levers that will allow us to execute our<br>governance responsibilities and to develop a systematic, structured way of dealing with all of the<br>areas for which SID is responsible. We will also continue to encourage the rest of the corporation<br>to partner with us, so that we can fulfill the DIRNSA's vision, becoming a single, global, selfaware, self-synchronzing SIGINT System the rest of the corporation to partner with us to<br>synchronize and align their processes and governance mechanisms for their governance<br>responsibilities.<br>(U//FOUO) As you can see, there is much work to be done. All of the implementing processes<br>for CRD, A&amp;P, and DA will have to be developed, eventually trickling down into local processes.<br>However, we've made a lot of progress already, and we know what we must do to get to our<br>desired destination. We are determined to create a seamless, global system that produces the<br>best SIGINT possible, in the most efficient way. Step by step, we'll make this a reality!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
