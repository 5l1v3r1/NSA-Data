U//FOUO) The African Union (AU) replaced the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in July 2002.
What led to this change? What is different about the AU? The AU is clearly pursuing a much
more active role in the resolution of crises in Africa. This seminar will discuss the current AU
peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan, as well as ambitious AU proposals for intervention
elsewhere on the continent. The promise of the AU and the challenges it faces as it strives to be
an effective institution able to shape Africa's future will also be addressed.
