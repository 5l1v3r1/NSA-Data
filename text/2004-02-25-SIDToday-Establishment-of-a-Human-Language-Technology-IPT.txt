DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Establishment of a Human Language Technology IPT<br>FROM:<br>Leader, HLT IPT<br>Run Date: 02/25/2004<br>FROM: <br>Leader, HLT IPT <br>(U//FOUO) For many years, NSA has tackled the language technology problem in several ways<br>by dedicating resources, both human and monetary, toward the advancement of the linguistic<br>techniques themselves and the development of more efficient analytic processes. Some of these<br>endeavors have been successful; others have not. Because of resource restrictions, many have<br>been directed at a very small percentage of the population.<br>(U//FOUO) As a result of the recent Human Language Technology (HLT) Assessment conducted<br>by the Office of Corporate Assessments (D5), and as part of the NSA business planning process,<br>Lt Gen Hayden, Mr. Black, and the corporate leadership team have identified HLT as one of a<br>number of key issues that require greater definition. The HLT Integrated Product Team (IPT) has<br>been established specifically to determine what NSA and the extended enterprise need in terms<br>of technological language services, and to develop a roadmap and a budget for getting reliable<br>services to the workforce. Working as a team with representation throughout the Agency, the<br>IPT will ensure that we are focusing on the right solutions and in the proper priority. Our<br>immediate aim is to influence the upcoming FY06 budget cycle. SID/Analysis and Production<br>(S2) is responsible for leading the HLT IPT on behalf of the Director, and Jim Allen has asked me<br>to head it.<br>(U//FOUO) This is not just a SID issue - it is a Agency issue. HLT is much more than a suite of<br>tools to assist language analysts in getting through stacks of data. HLT includes services for:<br>summarizing text, such as end product for our external customers;<br>detecting errors in documents and correcting them;<br>extracting content out of transcripts and other documents to populate databases;<br>build target templates; and<br>provide operational data for researchers.<br>We have an ambitious charter and a great deal of work ahead of us in a short amount of time.<br>(U//FOUO) We must make the most of this opportunity to determine how HLT can make<br>intelligence analysis more robust. The IPT will be focused on the heart of our core business ANALYSIS, not merely reporting, to satisfy our customers' Intelligence Needs. One area that we<br>will not take on as part if the IPT is language learning technology, although arguably, many of<br>the techniques we will be evaluating are suited for that purpose.<br>(U//FOUO) For HLT IPT's goals and objectives, and to see how you can help, see the HLT IPT<br>webpage .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p></p>
