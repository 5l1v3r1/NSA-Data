DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) The Bald Truth: Helping Your Leaders Make Decisions That Stick<br>(repost)<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 06/04/2004<br>(U) I bet you will agree that we have a problem with revisiting decisions. It<br>seems like every time a decision is announced around here, there is a retraction<br>and a revisit within 24 hrs. Can you relate? I can. Sadly, I have issued plenty of<br>retractions myself. Honestly, many were due to my mistakes -- but others were the result of a<br>faulty decision-making process. Did you ever wonder what causes this and what we could do<br>about it? Never fear, Dr. Berlin has a diagnosis and a prescription.<br>(U) The Symptoms and the Disease<br>(U) Most leaders have to make decisions in uncertainty. Uncertainty exists in a lack of<br>knowledge of our current state and a murky prediction about the future. Still, leaders have to<br>make decisions anyway -- waiting for perfect information is not a smart thing to do since it<br>never really arrives. We need to make our decisions with some lesser amount of information,<br>somewhere around 70 to 90 percent. But the problem is that we make decisions with way less<br>than 70 percent, and the equation changes from a risk to a gamble somewhere around the 50<br>percent mark. When the leader feels he is in the gamble region, he is particularly vulnerable to<br>the nugget virus . That is, when a single nugget of new information comes in, the leader's<br>confidence in the decision is shaken and a revisit is in the making.<br>(U) One reason this happens is the way the leader's immune system is suppressed by the point<br>solution briefing . Many an outstanding, up and coming, subordinate can craft up an advocacy<br>briefing that spells out the efficacy of the answer, the single answer. Our culture promotes the<br>point solution briefing because the antibodies to the answer will form early if the idea is<br>unpopular to the established status quo, so it is best to keep it quiet and don't even mention the<br>other possibilities lest they spur on the antibodies (I guess I am overdoing the medical analogy a<br>bit, but bear with me). Anyway, I often see great ideas literally sprung on the leadership with no<br>notice. Ever wanting to encourage innovation, our leaders hate to say no to a good idea and the<br>decision is made to go ahead (usually with funding and personnel support to follow - not further<br>specified). As we work out the details, the nuggets begin to arrive and the inevitable revisit<br>takes place. We immediately go into the paralysis-by-analysis mode and everything grinds to a<br>halt. I got the T-shirt on this one.<br>(U) The Cure<br>(U) Well the first thing is get the good staff work done in the first place (odd that a chief of staff<br>would advocate for this, no?). This means producing the good options brief rather than the evil<br>point solution brief . The options brief is really an intellectually honest depiction of the many<br>ways to skin this cat. It usually contains, among others, the "do nothing" option, the partial<br>option, the full option, the cheap option, the opposing organization's option and the out of the<br>box option. The idea is to present the landscape of solutions to the decision maker. The options<br>brief lists the criterion by which the leader would judge the decision and evaluates the pros and<br>cons of each option according to the criteria. Criteria could be:<br>cheaper,<br>faster,<br>more efficient,<br>supports others, etc.<br>The result is a matrix of options versus criterion that shows the total picture including resource<br>implications. Please do me a favor: if there is a resource cost, make a well-staffed<br>recommendation as to the source of the resource. It is only half a decision if we identify a need<br><br> </p>and not the source of satisfaction.<br>(U) Now, there is a place for advocacy here. At the end of the options discussion, you are<br>expected to make a staff recommendation on which of the options you would recommend, being<br>careful to list the pitfalls and risks for each option. It is also important to explain why the<br>decision needs to be made now. The timing of a decision is a legitimate factor in the discussion especially at the strategic level. Be ready to answer the question, why now? If you are smart<br>and a little bit lucky, your leader will select an option, decide and move on without looking back.<br>(U) How does this prescription help your leader make sticky decisions? Well, it inoculates the<br>decision maker from the nugget virus . With a good view of the landscape, the leader can<br>evaluate the impact of the newly arrived nugget. The leader can determine if the new<br>information is significant enough to warrant a legitimate re-look or just an insignificant<br>additional piece of data. The well-staffed options brief keeps your decision maker in the risk<br>regime and out of the gambling casino. Let's eliminate the unnecessary revisit with good staff<br>work.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
