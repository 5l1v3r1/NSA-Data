DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Surprises For a 'Shadow'?<br>FROM:<br>(S//SI) Missile Proliferation Branch (S2G22)<br>Run Date: 05/21/2004<br>FROM: <br>(S//SI) Missile Proliferation Branch (S2G22) <br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: We asked<br> to consider the<br>following question when writing about her day of shadowing: "What surprised you about SID and<br>your shadowing experience?"<br>(U//FOUO) Before I arrived to shadow MG Quirk for the day, I already had some opinions<br>formed about what the day would be like. In reading previous SID shadowing experiences, many<br>people had stressed how busy the SID leader's day was, but I don't think I quite understood just<br>how busy it could be. I arrived in MG Quirk's office at about 0715, a little before the SID<br>Leadership morning meeting began. I was introduced to MG Quirk, and then we were off.<br>(U//FOUO) The day continued with meeting after meeting after meeting. In addition to the<br>eleven meetings and appointments scheduled for the day, including a meeting with the Iraq<br>Issue Management Team (IMT), the SID Leadership morning meeting, various briefings and oneon-one meetings, MG Quirk was constantly squeezing in phone calls and addressing issues that<br>came up throughout the day.<br>(U//FOUO) At one point, I was told this was a light day, in comparison to his schedule on other<br>days. When a VTC on the Spring Offensive was postponed because of technical difficulties, MG<br>Quirk took advantage of the break in his schedule to squeeze in some extra time at his<br>computer. I was surprised by his ability to shift gears so effortlessly. As we jumped from<br>meeting to meeting, at times literally running through the hallways to get to them, MG Quirk<br>was prepared to change topics quickly and discuss the matter at hand.<br>(U//FOUO) I was surprised to see many of the same faces repeatedly during the day. The<br>various SID Leaders were involved in many of the same meetings throughout the day. While I<br>attempted to keep names, faces and positions straight in my mind, it struck me that it wasn't<br>really important what positions they held. The SID Leadership Team really acted as a team. They<br>all provided input on the various topics discussed, and while the SIGINT Director often led or<br>directed the meetings, he always asked for and placed equal importance on all participants'<br>input.<br>(U//FOUO) Many of the meetings that I sat in on seemed to have a common theme. The focus<br>was on where the Agency as a whole was headed in the future. When first entering MG Quirk's<br>office, I immediately noticed a large white board with a somewhat chaotic diagram with lots of<br>circles and other shapes connected to each other in various ways with different SID<br>organizations and issues written throughout. I soon learned that this was a diagram for the new<br>SID governance structure that the SID leadership has been working on, which made more sense<br>after MG Quirk explained it to me. Throughout the day, MG Quirk referred to this diagram in<br>meetings and briefings and was constantly tying things back to the idea of governance.<br>(U//FOUO) One particularly interesting briefing, again attended by the leadership, was on<br>Mission Allocation. The briefing suggested possible scenarios for expected increased hiring as<br>well as moving some aspects of the SIGINT mission to the field through developing new regional<br>sites. It was stressed in these meetings that the issue of governance and the changes the<br>Agency was attempting to undergo were supposed to be a transformation -- not a destination<br>the Agency was hoping to arrive at, but a journey.<br>(U//FOUO) When I hear about topics that trickle down to us here in the workforce through<br><br> </p>agency all e-mails, DIR-grams, the SID today webpage and other sources, many of these issues<br>seem intangible. Sitting in on these meetings allowed me to gain greater insight into the<br>processes and decision making strategies that go into these issues and how they affect me. My<br>day allowed me to appreciate the role of the SIGINT Director and his day-to-day work that<br>makes SIGINT happen. I thoroughly enjoyed my day shadowing the SIGINT Director and would<br>like to thank MG Quirk and his gracious staff for making my experience so worthwhile.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
