Included on my short list of high-impact factors are the following:<br>Transformation 2.0 , which redefines relationships within the cryptologic system and with<br>our partners and clients, and Corporate Governance as it relates to the Extended<br>Enterprise, which the Director reinvigorated late last year. Taken together, they enable a<br>cryptologic enterprise that is even more dynamic and interdependent than the system we<br>live in and operate today.<br>Mission Assurance , to ensure that to the extent possible, vital capabilities are not subject<br>to single points of failure.<br>Commitment to correct imbalance in demographics at the RSOCs *, which manage highturnover workforces to perform high-priority mission.<br>Projected growth of 500 NSA civilians each year through FY08. This is in excess of hiring<br>to replace attrition.<br>Ambitious work at the RSOCs , which creates opportunities for us to design and fit-out<br>state-of-the-art facilities.<br>The promise of "disruptive" technologies like the Next Generation Voice Tools, APATS,<br>and Knowledge System Prototype (KSP), which when deployed could change the way we<br>work. We are also giving increasing thought to the development of strategies and<br>methodologies to complement our "hunting" with improved means of avoiding strategic<br>surprise.<br>(U//FOUO) In order to accommodate these factors and others, I tasked senior A&amp;P leadership (to<br>include RSOC Commanders) with developing a plan to determine what missions we are going to<br>work in each node of the Enterprise and how we will manage ourselves to ensure maximum<br>effectiveness and efficiency.<br>(U//FOUO) Although we are not yet at a conclusion, we have had intensive dialog with the<br>enablers and Agency leadership and are closing in on a plan. Whatever the specifics of the plan<br>that emerges, it is absolutely clear that it will necessitate increased numbers of NSA civilians<br>at locations outside the Fort Meade complex , with most of the growth occurring at the<br>RSOCs. Some mission will be moved from here to there, some mission already there will be<br>augmented, and some new missions will spring up. As you would expect, we will need to adjust<br>manning through a combination of hiring at the destination locations and the transfer of some<br>people.<br>(U//FOUO) Although each situation will have its own nuances, the Denver Security Operations<br>Center (DSOC) offers a good model as we take the next steps in this journey. DSOC is the new<br>center of gravity for Weapons and Space -- in fact, the Director of DSOC is the Chief S2J*, and<br>at its culmination, more W&amp;S* personnel will be there than anywhere else.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U//FOUO) Since its inception, SIGINT has required an exceptional degree of sophistication and<br>flexibility, which has long been reflected in the dispersed nature of our enterprise. We cannot<br>yet describe with certainty how the enterprise will be configured and populated, but I am<br>confident that if we seize the opportunity to break free of current constraints, we can realize an<br>even better means of safeguarding our nation than is possible today.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>RSOCs = Regional Security Operations Centers <br>S2J = Weapons and Space (W&amp;S) <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
