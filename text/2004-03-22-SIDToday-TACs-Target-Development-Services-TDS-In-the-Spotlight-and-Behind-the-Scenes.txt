DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) TAC's Target Development Services (TDS): In the Spotlight and<br>Behind the Scenes<br>FROM:<br>Chief, TDS<br>Run Date: 03/22/2004<br>FROM: <br>Chief, TDS <br><br> <br><br>(S//SI) The primary mission of the Target Analysis Center's Target<br>Development Services (TDS) is to exploit communication services<br>enabled by the Global Intelligent Network, including the impending<br>convergence of circuit and packet switched networks. To see what<br>else we do, see our missions and functions .<br>(S//SI) Target Development Services is a familiar face to many<br>SIGINT analysts here at NSA and around the world. Some of our<br>more visible services include:<br>Knowledge Sharing : Over 300 hours of formal training<br>prepared and delivered to nearly 1,000 analysts in FY2003<br>exploring traffic analytic techniques and SIGINT exploitation<br>of advanced communications technologies, in addition to<br>non-NCS activities, such as the GEO BOOTCAMP and the<br>standing-room-only monthly Personal Communications<br>Systems (PCS) working group, and hosting GNA and IA<br>intern tours to disseminate concrete skills to the product<br>lines through personnel transfer;<br>Tools : More than 15 operational prototypes serving over<br>4,000 analysts worldwide with tools such as the BANYAN for<br>contact chaining, SPOTBEAM for INMARSAT analysis, and<br>DISHFIRE for Short Message Service analysis;<br>Target Development : Support to specific target<br>development for virtually all product lines; and<br>Analytic Technique Development : Recent successes have<br>included PCS Short Message Service, advanced contact<br>chaining, and mobile services exploitation.<br>(S//SI) These very visible services are only the tip of the iceberg.<br>TDS supports SIGINT analysts with many services that are<br>virtually transparent to those of you using the data and tools we<br>enable. For example:<br>Number Normalization : We take numbers from their varied<br>intercepted formats and translate them to international<br>numbering plan standard format, allowing homogenous<br>global analysis of the call event metadata set;<br>Data Management : We receive and analyze new data<br>streams weekly, establishing preprocessing protocols and<br>feeding the data into corporate databases like FASCIA,<br>ASSOCIATION, and MAINWAY;<br>Driving Collection : We drive and fund requirements for<br>collection and processing systems like POPTOP, TUMBRIL,<br>and OCTAVE;<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SIGINT Development <br>1.

The TAC's Metadata<br>Analysis Cell (MAC)<br>5.  The TAC's Social<br>Network Analysis<br>Workcenter (SNAW)<br>6.  TAC's Target<br>Development<br>Services (TDS): In<br>the Spotlight and<br>Behind the Scenes<br>7.  The NAC's Advanced<br>Network<br>Development &amp;<br>Analysis (ANDA)<br>Division<br>8.  The NAC's<br>Data/Network<br>Operations Center<br>(DNOC)<br><br> </p>Finding New Opportunities : We scour communications<br>protocols to identify SIGINT toeholds for exploitation, such<br>as tracking communications across prepaid network<br>services; and<br>Next Generation Automation : Working with NSA IT<br>infrastructure leadership to stay on the cutting edge of<br>technological advances enabling innovations in future tool<br>development.<br>(TS//SI) The work of TDS leads directly to intelligence results .<br>For example,<br>Pakistan/Terrorism : Detailed analysis of SS7<br>communications enabled the identification of key roaming<br>chokepoints into and out of Pakistan through the GSM<br>Mobilink network. These chokepoints had not been on cover<br>prior to this discovery. When these points in the network<br>were covered, they immediately began producing<br>intelligence relating to the travel and calling activities<br>relating to high priority terrorist targets.<br>Bosnia/War Criminals : DISHFIRE, the SMS repository and<br>retrieval/analysis tool, has proved to be the sole source for<br>detailed information on the activities and whereabouts of<br>several Bosnian war criminals and their compatriots. SMS,<br>in fact, has led to the apprehension of some of those<br>criminals.<br>KSM Capture : The many tools built and maintained by TDS<br>provide a better understanding of networks, numbering<br>plans, and target identifiers. In the case of Khalil Sheik<br>Muhammed (KSM), CT analysts knowledgeable about the<br>benefits provided by these tools were able to identify the<br>communications equipment used by KSM and then provide<br>CIA with insights as to his location. These tip-offs were the<br>first indication of KSM's presence in Karachi, Pakistan.<br>Weapons of Mass Destruction : Analysts within the Office of<br>Proliferation and Arms Control have used TDS tools and<br>analytic expertise to pinpoint activities of dealers involved<br>in buying and selling arms, propellant ingredients, and other<br>items relating to WMD. In addition, they have used TDS<br>tools for SIGINT Development successes in the areas of<br>subscriber correlations and identification of new computer<br>addresses.<br>(TS//SI) For more information about the intelligence successes<br>resulting from the analysis and exploitation of SMS, go to the PCS<br>Working Group notes for 23 feb 2004 .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
