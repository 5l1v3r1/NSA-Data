If you missed it, see part 1 (S//SI)<br>(TS//SI) All this connectivity is fantastic and perhaps enough to<br>perform a satisfactory job, but the real combat multiplier is<br>augmenting this access with personal contacts on the ground. By<br>physically being in Haiti, I had regular access to US embassy<br>personnel, the CJTF-Haiti Marine J2 (Director of Intelligence),<br>Marine Radio Battalion operators doing tactical SIGINT, SOCOM*<br>planners and operators who were in charge of the missions going<br>against Haitian High Value Targets (HVTs), the Canadian SIGINT<br>personnel working the Haiti deployment in a camp right next to<br>ours, the TAREX** team sent to do surveys of Port au Prince and<br>Haiti, and the CJTF-Haiti Counter-Intelligence team that often<br>roamed the countryside working on leads. As a result, I was able to<br>act as a two-way transmission point for collection items from these<br>assets on the ground in Haiti back to the TOPI (Target Office of<br>Primary Interest).<br>(TS//SI) Two examples come to mind. On one occasion, the CJTF-H<br>CI team leader passed me some notes from a trip to the central<br>highlands of Haiti where they met with rebel leaders who controlled<br>the area. During this trip they had collected several telephone<br>numbers of these leaders and their associates. Within a week of my<br>passing these numbers to the TOPI, we began to see multi-page<br>reports of conversations between one important rebel leader and<br>his wife which provided insight into his negotiating position and<br>plans for control of the central highlands. One report was<br>immediately briefed to the CJTF-H J3 (Director of Operations) and<br>had a direct impact on our negotiations with the rebel leader. On<br>another occasion, the CJTF-H J2 passed to me a French-Creole<br>document that contained a list of the new Haiti police<br>commissioners and their telephone numbers. I was only too happy<br>to pass this on to the TOPI as well.<br><br>(U//FOUO) NIST personnel one week before returning home (the<br>author is on the right). The building in the background is CJTF-Haiti<br>HQ.<br>(TS//SI) An eye-opening experience for both me and the TOPI<br>back here at NSAW was the realization that some customers are<br>looking for a different kind of product than what is produced for<br>most SIGINT customers. This takes some getting used to, because<br>often we are conditioned to pass on only the data that meets the<br>criteria for normal SIGINT reporting. One of the "surge" efforts<br>performed by the TOPI was to send out gists with a quick<br>translation of every HVT-related conversation, with the time of call,<br>etc. -- a simplified and streamlined KL, in effect.<br><br>1.

One operator was<br>actually with a source in Haiti when the source received a<br>telephone call. Operators used the SIGINT gists to help corroborate<br>who and when calls were made between sources and HVTs. So,<br>while the call itself was of inconsequential value to the normal<br>SIGINT customers, there was a very high value to the tactical<br>customers on the ground.<br>(TS//SI) I received several emails from people who were<br>incredulous that a conversation between an HVT target and his<br>girlfriend was of any importance. The truth is that a lot of SIGINT<br>"leavings" that never make it into normal SIGINT reporting are<br>actually valuable intelligence items for tactical warfighters. In fact,<br>sometimes they are the most important elements of information<br>for warfighters. We may like the crusts cut off of our peanut butter<br>sandwiches, but that does not mean that others would wish the<br>same.<br>(TS//SI) As for Haiti itself, it was both haunting and amazing. The<br>people are friendly and there is much to see. I had some of the<br>best food of my life while I was there. Having said that, the country<br>is in dire straits and the most impoverished sections of Port au<br>Prince are decrepit beyond words. The land has been so devastated<br>from deforestation that the nation is always one natural disaster<br>away from catastrophe, which I expect to be the cycle for the<br>foreseeable future.<br>(TS//SI) I was thrilled at the opportunity to drive around the city<br>and was amazed at how much fun I had behind the wheel in the<br>chaotic streets of Haiti, but it is bittersweet knowing that progress<br>there is haphazard, if it happens at all. I grew to love Haiti in my<br>short two months there, but that is little solace to those who live<br>there. Time will tell for Haiti.<br>(S//SI) I am ecstatic that I was able to participate in the<br>contingency NIST deployment to Haiti.
