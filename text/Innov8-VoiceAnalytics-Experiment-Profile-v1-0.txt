Detail the nature of the Experiment as a high level plain English description. Refrain from using
overly technical terms if possible. Justify briefly why this Experiment should run, with a high level
summary of Experiment, Conditions, De-risking effort, Business Case and Expected Outcomes/
Benefits.

As part of the Joint Capability Activity (JCA) in partnership with GCHQ, experiments
by Voice Analytics are to be conducted within the Joint Collaboration Environment
(JCE) using DISTILLERY VoiceRT is NSA’s currently deployed voice analytics
technology that delivers integrated speaker ID (SID), language ID (LID), gender ID
(GID), dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) detection, speech activity detection
(SAD), and phonetic keyword search (i.e., direct keyword search on audio data) in
more than 25 key foreign languages. VoiceRT requires specific hardware,
proprietary process provisioning software (Tibco), and uses an older voice analytics
technology. A new initiative is underway to create the next generation of VoiceRT
that operates on commodity hardware (GHOSTMACHINE), replaces the Tibco
process provisioning software with DISTILLERY, and makes use of the latest voice
analytics technology from R64 (including the new Speech-to-Text). Voice Analytics
experiments will occur in phases with this proposal being the first phase.

The business case for running Phase 1 of the Voice Analytics experiment in the
JCE is to demonstrate the following:

•	LPT voice data can be ingested into GHOSTMACHINE and passed to
DISTILLERY for processing at the rate of arrival.

•	DISTILLERY can run a subset of voice analytics (SAD, GID, and LID) on
voice data.

•	Running multiple analytics on voice data in parallel produces the same result
as running each analytic independently.

•	DISTILLERY can pass results from an analytic as input to a follow-on
analytic with decision points throughout the dataflow based on analytic
results (e.g. If GID reports the speaker is male, pass the data to LID;
otherwise, stop processing the voice cut).

•	DISTILLERY is capable of resource management at high speeds. If a voice
analytic process in DISTILLERY is unable to handle the ingest rate,
DISTILLERY can spawn additional voice analytic processes. Similarly, if
resources from one set of voice analytic processes can be better used
elsewhere, DISTILLERY will remove from memory some/all of the set of
voice analytic processes.

•	Determine the scalability as additional analytics are loaded into memory and
processing data. How is the previous bullet affected as free memory goes to
zero? How quickly can voice analytic processes be spawned and broken
down?

Benefits

Outcome	Expected Benefit	How will benefit be measured?	KPI (CSF)	Reference  Number
Demonstrate the JCE environment (including GHOSTMACHINE and DISTILLERY) can get data to core analytics at ingest rate.	The JCE environment can be used to process voice content. GHOSTMACHINE and DISTILLERY can maintain speeds required to processes voice on a 10G link.  Add DISTILLERY to  GHOSTMACHINE  stack.	Monitor ingest pick-up directory that feeds DISTILLERY input.		
Demonstrate the JCE architecture can affordably scale in line with other VoIP  accesses.	If the outcome is true, then the JCE environment provides a good test environment for future voice processing experiments. If VoiceRT is to eventually be replaced with this new technology, then tests must be run against a similar environment. This experiment also tests DISTILLERY's ability to dynamically manage resources, which is a requirement for our voice processing.	Compare quantity of VoIP data processed at JCE against that collected on similar links at NSAW and  GCHQ.		
Demonstrate voice analytic processing of incoming data significantly reduces the amount of unintended collection reaching long-term stores by filtering on Language ID, Speech Activity Detection, and Gender ID.	Analysts can be directed to smaller, more probable collected voice cuts. Since voice files can be very large, significantly reduces the amount of long- term storage required.	DISTILLERY will be configured to separate wanted and unwanted  VoIP files in separate storage locations. Comparing sizes of the two locations will provide an approximation for the ratio of wanted versus unwanted traffic.

Demonstrate voice processing can be performed on commodity hardware (GHOSTMACHINE). Current voice processing at NSA has hardware specific requirements.	Voice analytics can be executed on commodity hardware alongside other applications. Allows for easier hardware maintenance and shorter deployments.	Analysts will confirm resulting data has been filtered without a loss of wanted traffic.		
JCE experiments can process content while remaining in compliance with US and UK laws.	Future experiments requiring content for processing can leverage.	If  MONKEYPUZZL  E can safely produced selected content to the experiment, then it should be in compliance.

Plan

Timeline, including dependencies/pre-requisites, set-up, operation, evaluation, reporting,
closedown. Also includes deliberate outages of equipment.

As stated in the business case, this is Phase 1 of the Voice Analytics Experiment.
This phase is divided into four sub-experiments focusing on dataflow through a select
group of voice analytics (SAD, GID, LID) in DISTILLERY. All four experiments
require access to CSDF voice files. Future phases will consider SOTF once
GHOSTMACHINE can support this format.

Exp. 1: Independent Analytic Tests (~1 week) - Designed to test the dataflow from
DISTILLERY input, through a few processing blocks, and the output displayed to a
GUI. Each analytic is executed independently as a single instance to determine
accuracy and processing speed.

Exp. 2: Parallel Analytic Tests (~1 week) - Similar to first experiment, but each
CSDF voice file is run against each of the three voice analytics simultaneously. This
should confirm data is not corrupted by multiple processes accessing simultaneously.
Experiment also adds the complexity of holding results until all analytics have
executed prior to displaying on GUI.______________________________

Exp. 3: Linked Analytic Tests (~1 week) - Similar to the previous experiments, but
results from the voice analytics are now used to make decisions about future
processing of each file. The ingest rate should be fast enough to create a noticeable
bottleneck in flow.

Exp. 4: Dynamic Resource Manager Tests (~2 week) - Builds off of the third
experiment. The SAD algorithm is much faster than GID and LID. In this
experiment, DISTILLERY should be able to dynamically create/remove additional
GID and LID analytic processes to compensate for GID and LID processes falling
behind or becoming idle. A more advanced part of this experiment would be to
monitor DISTILLERY’S response to all system memory in use; for example, 100 GID
analytics and 150 GID analytics are still falling behind, but no system memory exists
to spawn additional processes. Does one set of analytic processes starve or do we
see a constant exchange of memory between GID and LID?
