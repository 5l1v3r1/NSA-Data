Hello Ed,

Executive Orders (E.O.s) have the "force and effect of law." That said, you
are correct that E.O.s cannot override a statute.

In general, DOD and ODNI regulations are afforded similar precedence though
subject matter or date could result in one having precedence over another.

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss further.

Regards,

Message: Hello, I have a question regarding the mandatory USSID 18 training.

Approved for Release by NSA on 05-29-2014, FOIA Case #'
78071__________________________________________________

The training states the following:

(U) The Hierarchy of Governing Authorities and Documents is displayed from the
highest authority to the lowest authority as follows:

U.S. Constitution

Federal Statutes/Presidential Executive Orders (EO)

Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ÛDNI) Regulations

NSA/CSS Directives and Policies
USSIDs

SID Management Directives and Policies
Office Policies

I'm not entirely certain, but this does not seem correct, as it seems to imply
Executive Orders have the same precedence as law. My understanding is that
EOs may be superseded by federal statute, but EOs may not override statute.

Am I incorrect in this? Between EOs and laws, which have precedence?

Similarly, between DOD and ODNI regulations, which has greater precedence?

Could you please clarify?

Thank you very much,

Ed
