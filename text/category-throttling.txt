How to configure category throttling in XKEYSCORE

Category throttling is performed by the selected output plugin, in the xks.config you need to make sure
that you are using this plugin to perform forwarding. You will also need to have throttle=yes in the
configfor the plugin.

Ex:

plugin[selected_output] = enable=yes, conf ig_f ile=ITthrottle=yes
di rectory=/export/data/xkeyscore/outputs/mailorde r_working
add_d706=true pass_fragments=true max_age=900 max_size=5000000TT

If this was not already set, in order for the changes to take effect you will need to then perform the
following commands:

xks setup plugins
xks proc saferestart

At this point category throttling is now enabled with the default values of 1GB and 1000000000000
sessions. Once either of these limits is reached XKEYSCORE will continue to process data but will no
longer forward session that hit on that category. By navigating to the category throttle page you will be
able to see the current status of the categories that have been throttled. A category will not appear on
this page until it has hit once that day. In the following example the site default was changed to 5MB
and 500 sessions:

In the example above categories 1 and 4 and currently being throttled, category 1 has reached both the
session count and MB limit, while category 4 has only reached the MB limit. Without category throttling
category 4 would have forwarded 342.8KB.

You can also check the status of the throttle from the command line using:

mysqls	quota_status_current	: show quota_limits forwarding

status for all categories

mysqls	quota_status_yesterday : show quota_limits forwarding

status for previous day

mysqls	quota_throttled_current : shows top 20 categories for

current day. (negative remaining indicates cat was
throttled)
