(TS//SI//REL) Modern SIM cards (Phase 2+) have an application program interface
known as the SIM Toolkit (STK). The STK has a suite of proactive commands that
allow the SIM card to issue commands and make requests to the handset.
MONKEYCALENDAR uses STK commands to retrieve location information and to
exfiltrate data via SMS. After the MONKEYCALENDAR file is compiled, the
program is loaded onto the SIM card using either a Universal Serial Bus (USB)
smartcard reader or via over-the-air provisioning. In both cases, keys to the card
may be required to install the application depending on the service provider’s
security configuration
