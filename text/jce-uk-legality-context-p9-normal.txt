•At the start of this talk I mentioned the ECHR and said I would cover
Article 13. Article 13 allows for the public to bring about complaints
against public authorities if they feel that one (or more) of their
Human Rights have been violated.

•RIPA created a the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to handle these
complaints. They are like the Commissioners and deal with each
complaint under the veil of secrecy.
