MH 5 Leverages Deep-Dive Packet ?nalysis to ldentifyr Feasibilityr of Against Taber: and Hotmail

 

Automated deep packet analysis of "r?ahoo and Hotmail providers gives keen insight into the potential success of exploitation against these services-

is a set of CHD man?on?the?side capabilities that involves real?time packet inject in response to passive collection of target communications- 
inspects each packet. one at a time. for a set of keywords that determine if the packet originated from a CHE target and if a modi?ed response to that packet might result in exploitation ofthe client
computer- Because each packet is inspected individuallyr. if keywords occur across packet boundaries the QUANTUMTHEDRY technique will not tipthe SIGIHT attempt exploitation of a
client- As HTTP headers and the size ofcookies grows. the likelihood of all keywords occurring within a single packet reduces- l'u'lHS in collaboration with and the ROC-
productiaed an l'u'lapfFiteduce analytic that leverages the packets collected and made accessible to analyrtics 
identi?es the keywords in a packet capture and generates statistics for each service Hotmail and 'i?ahoo} to determine how often all of the
keywords occur within a single packet- This would not have been possible without EHETEEGRE providing a platform for analysis to mass-deployr packet-level processing- Approximatelv of
Hotmail and E?'if: of'i?ahoo sessions contain the keywords necessaryr within a single packet to be targeted
