Ambassador James Cunningham, the deputy U.S. representative, was<br>then nominated to be the U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.<br>The DCI's representative at USUN then announced that she also was moving to Baghdad to<br>continue to be Ambassador Negroponte's intelligence briefer, and the deputy DCI's<br>representative also announced that he was moving on to another assignment. But before all that<br>was announced, our very own NSA representative to USUN,<br>had announced not only<br>the August 2004 end of his 3-year assignment but also his retirement from federal service in<br>early September!<br>(S//SI) Oh, did I forget to mention that the U.S. Mission also moved? Yes, they moved from just<br>across 1st Avenue from the United Nations complex in New York City into temporary, leased<br>spaces in a commercial building three blocks away while the original building is demolished and<br>a new one built at the same location. This is not a trivial situation for intelligence support.<br>(S//SI) Before the move, the U.S. ambassadors and other representatives could be briefed on<br>intelligence up to a few minutes before a Security Council meeting since all they had to do was<br>cross the street to the UN. But now Ambassador Danforth, the new U.S. representative to the<br>UN, and other officers from USUN, need more time to walk (yes, they generally walk) the three<br>blocks to the UN, so we will have to be even faster with any last-minute intelligence. And this is<br>exacerbated by the fact that USUN interim spaces occupy only a few floors of a very tall building<br>that is shared with many other businesses, making the handling of classified information more<br>challenging.<br>(TS//SI) The Negroponte years at USUN proved momentous and historic. SIGINT support to<br>USUN and the State Department in support of U.S. goals in the UN Security Council --- where<br>the strategic intent of nations amalgamates into tactical diplomatic maneuvering --- also proved,<br>shall we say, "secretly historic." A few days before Ambassador Negroponte was sworn-in as the<br>U.S. representative to the UN, terrorists struck in New York, at the Pentagon, and on United<br>Airlines Flight 93 near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The morning after the attacks the UN Security<br>Council and the UN General Assembly met, amid the smoldering smell that permeated the<br>chambers (as <br>described it), to approve resolutions condemning the attacks.<br>(S/SI) As the U.S. mounted a strategic response to these attacks and worked with the UN to<br>garner world support for the global war on terrorism, SIGINT proved vital in the U.S.<br>negotiations that resulted in two key and unanimously-approved Security Council resolutions on<br>Iraq. SIGINT also contributed to the composition of the U.S. President's speech at the UN<br>General Assembly in September of 2002, and to Secretary Powell's presentation to the Security<br>Council on the case against the Iraq dictator, among other events. SIGINT also helped USUN<br>and State officials in their decisions regarding Afghanistan, countless peacekeeping operations<br>around the world, Africa, Sudan and so many other situations.<br>(S//SI) But now looking to the future, Ambassador Danforth recently set clear goals for USUN<br>for the next number of months. His deputy, Ambassador Anne Patterson, is now in place and is<br>an experienced user of SIGINT. A new DCI representative is in place (a former Presidential Daily<br>Brief [PDB] briefer) and his new deputy has also just arrived. And <br>successor as the<br>NSA representative, <br> is also in place. <br>is an accomplished intelligence professional<br>with unique experience as a SIGINT liaison to a third party partner.<br>(S//SI) Fortunately for USUN, the array of technicians, collectors, analysts, managers and<br><br> </p>support personnel across NSA, that makes focused and responsive SIGINT support to USUN<br>possible, has not changed much these past few months. We know that NSA will continue<br>providing incredible support to the new front-line players at USUN.<br>(U//FOUO) On a related subject, see<br><br> recent SID today article, Life in the Big Apple .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
