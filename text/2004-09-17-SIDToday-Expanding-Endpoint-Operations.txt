DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Expanding Endpoint Operations<br>FROM: COL <br> USA<br>Deputy Chief, Remote Operations Center (S321)<br>Run Date: 09/17/2004<br><br>(S//SI) Endpoint operations activey subvert systems that create, store, or manage information - computers, peripherals, and telephone switches -- in order to directly retrieve data of<br>intelligence value or achieve other operational ends. Tailored Access Operations (TAO) develops<br>and employs technologies and techniques for endpoint operations.<br>(S) Endpoint operations have resulted in reporting from all SID Product Lines and regularly<br>assists SIGINT development, midpoint collection, and cryptanalysis and exploitation efforts.<br>Endpoint collection also directly supports CIA and JSOC* counter-terrorism operations.<br>(U//FOUO) TAO is expanding endpoint operations: increasing the number and diversity of<br>targets and building a more scalable and robust endpoint operations infrastructure. A part of this<br>expansion is the acquisition of a new endpoint access remote operations center (ROC)<br>that is capable of managing and conducting endpoint operations on a scale that will dramatically<br>expand collection available to our internal and external customers.<br>(S//SI) This new ROC facility is scheduled to begin coming on line in the summer of 2005. It will<br>be located on the 3rd floor of the R&amp;E Building. As well as the growth reflected in the table<br>below, this expansion will provide a main operations floor, a Technology Demonstration Center,<br>and a training facility. The main operations floor and operations break-out rooms are used to<br>conduct initial exploitation operations and sustained collection that involves human command<br>and control of the operation.<br>Current ROC<br><br>-<br><br>ROC 2005<br><br>5<br><br>Operations Break-out Rooms<br><br>13<br><br>2<br><br>Operations Teaming Areas<br><br>5<br><br>51<br><br>Server Racks<br><br>170<br><br>120<br><br>Personnel<br><br>215<br><br>17,000<br><br>Usable Square Feet<br><br>40,000+<br><br>(S//SI) Building the operations floor and increasing the number of break-out rooms will enable<br>us to grow from the current average of 20-25 of these operations per day to over 100 per day<br>and will facilitate the integration of NSA/CSS computer network operations and real-time<br>customer support. Sustained collection involving automated implants pushing collected data<br>from targets to the ROC as well as voice and geolocation collection are managed from the<br>Operations Teaming Areas. The increased capacity in this area will support a growth from<br>managing an average of 100-150 active implants today to simultaneously managing thousands<br>of implanted targets. The increased personnel capacity will support this net growth in operations<br>tempo and will allow the integration of TAO's Requirements &amp; Targeting Division alongside the<br>ROC's operators in order to better synchronize target development and efficiently plan and<br>execute endpoint operations.<br>(S//SI) The new ROC is but one facet of a much broader endpoint access expansion program.<br>Other elements include exporting endpoint access operations to the RSOCs, dramatic<br>improvements in automation, entirely new classes of hardware and software implants, more<br>modular and standardized tool designs, and robust technology sharing and coordinated<br>development with our First and Second Party partners. Overall growth of endpoint operations<br>depends on the synergy of all these elements to balance endpoint target development<br>capabilities, mission management processes, and efficient flow of collected data to production<br><br> </p>organizations.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>JSOC = Joint Special Operations Command <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
