DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) SIREM, Son of PLUS<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 03/23/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>Unknown <br>(U//FOUO) The SIGINT System keeps track of its production metrics with an interface called<br>"PLUS." For a given report, PLUS shows the collection sources, the offices that produced the<br>report, case notations, etc. It also includes a customer feedback tool. When, in the aftermath of<br>9/11, the Agency found that it needed even better production metrics, Customer Gateway (S11)<br>set about evaluating the situation.<br>(U//FOUO) They discovered that although PLUS was technically sound, it had suffered from a<br>lack of investment in recent years and was long overdue for modernization. (Its underlying<br>technology is over 10 years old and nearly all of its commercial components are obsolete and<br>lack any form of support.)<br>(U//FOUO) In the last year or two, PLUS has been upgraded as much as possible to improve its<br>data sharing, system interfaces, equipment and databases. However, a still-more-powerful tool<br>is needed. As a result, plans are underway to acquire a new and improved "son of PLUS." This<br>effort is called SIgint Reporting Metrics, or SIREM.<br>(U//FOUO) Customer Gateway and Cryptologic Mission Management (CMM - SDN9) got together<br>and sent out a call for new requirements for SIREM in early December 2003. They got lots of<br>input and talked with many users, and the requirements have been gathered and analyzed. As<br>the next step, the project managers are checking out a commercial Business Intelligence tool<br>called COGNOS, to see if it can do the job. Between now and July, COGNOS will be tested to see<br>how well it meets the requirements; if it proves worthwhile, the tool will be deployed as PLUS<br>version 6.0.<br>(U//FOUO) Further down the road, the SKYCAST database (against which PLUS queries are run)<br>is due for modernization, and this should complete the drive to improve NSA's SIGINT<br>production metrics. Customer Gateway technical leaders are excited about how these efforts are<br>shaping up: they have enjoyed a very productive collaboration with CMM, the requirements were<br>gathered speedily, and the piloting effort is proceeding well, leveraging other related<br>investigations across SID (i.e. other Agency offices are also checking out COGNOS). With any<br>luck, we are well on the way towards giving the Agency the metrics tools we need for the future.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about SIREM, please contact <br>Leader, Customer Gateway, at <br>nsa.<br><br>, Technical<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
