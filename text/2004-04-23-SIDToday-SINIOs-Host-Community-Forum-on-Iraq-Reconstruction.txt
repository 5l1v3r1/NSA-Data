Much about the Iraqi recovery isn't aired, but that's where a larger story can be found.<br>With the coming handover of power to the people of Iraq, information on the restoration of<br>Iraq's economy and infrastructure are likely to only gain in importance. With that in mind, NSA's<br>SINIO and Deputy SINIO for Economics on April 15 hosted an afternoon of discussions to<br>examine and elevate awareness of those issues.<br>(S//SI) Analysts, customers, and partners from CIA, Commerce, Treasury, State, and DIA came<br>to NSA to present their perspectives in two separate sessions. The first session was attended by<br>product line leadership from the Offices of Middle East/North Africa, International Security<br>Issues, Regional Targets, and China and Korea, as well as by representatives from the Iraq Issue<br>Manager Team (IMT) and the Requirements Analysis Center (RAC). The second was an open<br>forum for NSA analysts to discuss the issues with the visitors in greater depth.<br>(S) As noted in both sessions, stable recovery and the security situation are often linked, as in<br>the importance of pipeline security to oil exports. Establishing and maintaining security is, and<br>will remain, important in order to attract outside technical assistance and investment. The<br>sources, movement, and uses of financing by Iraqi insurgents are another area where Iraq's<br>security and infrastructure intersect, and intelligence that provides insight on such financing will<br>continue to be essential to security.<br>(S) The discussions covered aspects of recovery not tied to security as well. For example, as<br>control shifts to the Iraqi people and the economy becomes increasingly sophisticated, we may<br>face challenges in accessing vital information about Iraq's economic and financial infrastructure.<br>Policymakers here will nonetheless continue to need access to such information to know if sound<br>policies are being developed by the Iraqi government and to learn what the leadership views<br>are on economic reform.<br>(S//SI) It was also clear from the discussion that much of the forward progress within Iraq will<br>depend on events that take place beyond its borders, and the challenges in those areas are no<br>less significant. A healthy trade posture and development of the non-oil sector will be an<br>important pillar of Iraqi recovery, but key issues such as Iraq's status in the World Trade<br>Organization are already prompting some states to voice their limits in supporting Iraq's<br>progress. On the issue of debt relief, the US continues negotiating with other states over how<br>much debt incurred under Saddam should be forgiven. For the wide range of these<br>reconstruction issues, SIGINT has and will continue to have an impact.<br>(C) As notes from the sessions are finalized, issues presented by the Community will be<br>compared against standing Information Needs. With guidance from the IMT and the RAC, any<br>gaps will be submitted into the NSRP. We will continue a dialog with the Community and will<br>reach out to policymakers to maintain an up-to-date awareness of key issues.
