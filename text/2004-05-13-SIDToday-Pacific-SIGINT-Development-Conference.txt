In return, delegates received briefings on some<br>of the National and 5-Eyes initiatives, as well as the work of SIGDEV teams in the China and<br>Korea, Counterterrorism, Russia, and International Crime and Narcotics Product Lines.<br>(U//FOUO) Two days of briefings and lively discussions intended to facilitate the exchange of<br>information, were followed by a full morning session that identified a number of actions that will<br>enable better orchestration and coordination of SIGDEV activities, some of which will have<br>benefits beyond the confines of the Pacific-theater.<br>(U//FOUO) SSG would like to thank all the briefers, organizers and those delegates who were<br>prepared to travel great distances at short notice in helping make this conference such a<br>success. We now look forward to the next conference, possibly hosted by MSOC in September<br>2004, taking SIGDEV in the Pacific-theater to even greater heights.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>DSD = Australia's Defence Signals Directorate <br>GCSB = New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau <br>GCHQ = The UK's Government Communications Headquarters <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
