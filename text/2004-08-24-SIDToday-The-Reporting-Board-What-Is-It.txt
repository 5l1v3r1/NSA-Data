Who are they and what do they<br>do?<br>(U//FOUO) If you went to our web page , you'd find that "The SID Reporting Board, as an<br>advocate for SIGINT reporting, in conjunction with a robust reporters' network, identifies and<br>communicates best practices in reporting with the goal of facilitating current reporting and<br>evolving smoothly to e-SIGINT."<br>(U//FOUO) OK, what's that in plain English? What is an organization in Customer Response<br>doing speaking for analysts in Analysis and Production?<br>... As that page says, we "team with other elements that have similar goals" -- Reporting Policy<br>and Guidance, NSOC*, RSOCs*, the Intelligence Analysis Career Panel and Advisory Council,<br>Futures Reporting, field representatives, production offices, the National Cryptologic School, the<br>SIGINT Development office, and customers -- to identify and try to resolve overarching issues<br>that affect reporting.<br>(U//FOUO) Who are we? Five long-time reporters -- military, ex-military, and civilian -- with<br>experience in a variety of areas: language, field-site reporting, senior analysis/reporting from<br>several Product Lines, policy dissemination, Information Assurance, and teaching (two of our<br>number still teach reporting classes).<br>(U//FOUO) "Why haven't I heard of the RB before?" Well, much of our work is done through<br>liaison with other entities, and many of our achievements are publicized by other organizations.<br>We often work behind the scenes to influence issues that affect reporters, and the result may be<br>the addition of a button on a reporting tool, or a field that no longer has to be manually filled in.<br>A recent unpublicized accomplishment was the identification of INformation Technology (IT)<br>issues as a source of much user dissatisfaction with reporting tools. This came about as a result<br>of the Board's participation in the Report Requirements Board under the JOURNEYMAN program.<br>The RRB will analyze user comments on proposed upgrades to take these issues into account<br>and see that they are directed to IT to resolve.<br>(U//FOUO) "How Can I Give the RB My Ideas and Views?" The Virtual Reporting Board, an<br>e-mail alias of volunteers (mainly senior reporters in A&amp;P and in the field), brings a valuable<br>breadth and depth to the discussion of reporting issues. If you want to bring something up, or<br>participate in these discussions, e-mail<br>@nsa or dl virtualrb.<br>(U//FOUO) Watch for more information in tomorrow's SIDtoday: What the Reporting Board<br>Can Do for You .<br>*(U) Notes: <br>NSOC = National Security Operations Center <br>RSOC = Regional Security Operations Center <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
