COTTONMOUTH-II

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL) COTTONMOUTH-II (CM-II) is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) hardware Host
Tap, which will provide a covert link over USB link into a targets network. CM-II is intended
to be operate with a long haul relay subsystem, which is co-located within the target
equipment. Further integration is needed to turn this capability into a deployable system.

(TS//SI//REL) CM-II will provide software persistence capability, “in-field” re-programmability,
and covert communications with a host software implant over the USB. CM-II will also
communicate with Data Network Technologies (DNT) software (STRAITBIZARRE) through a
covert channel implemented on the USB, using this communication channel to pass
commands and data between hardware and software implants. CM-II will be a GENIE-
compliant implant based on CHIMNEYPOOL.

(TS//SI//REL) CM-II consists of the CM-I digital hardware and the long haul relay concealed
somewhere within the target chassis. A USB 2.0 HS hub with switches is concealed in a
dual stacked USB connector, and the two parts are hard-wired, providing a intra-chassis link.
The long haul relay provides the wireless bridge into the target’s network.
