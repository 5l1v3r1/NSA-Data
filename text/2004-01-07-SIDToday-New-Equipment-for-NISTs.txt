S1312 IT desk officers<br>CTRC(SW) <br>USN, and CTR2 <br> USN finalized equipment procurement in<br>early November for equipment initially designated to be a test platform.<br>(S//SI) Responding to increased processing and multi-tasking requirements for NSA's team<br>supporting CJTF-7 in Baghdad, AS23 system administrators rapidly shifted their focus from<br>building a test bed system to building a functional suite for immediate deployment. Finalizing the<br>system build in under one week, AS233 system administrators deployed to Baghdad on 24<br>November to begin the installation of the system.<br>(S) The mainframe of the equipment (pictured below) includes dual PowerEdge 2650 processors,<br>a PowerVault disk array, and line conditioning UPS units. In addition to increased processing<br>power in a stable environment, the system provides on-site Microsoft Exchange Server and user<br>file hosting. Specially configured to fit inside two shock-mounted ruggedized containers, the<br>system will ensure NSA's forward deployed personnel are provided state-of-the-art equipment<br>in a tactical environment.<br> <br>Hardware rack <br>(S) To support increased multi-tasking, positions at CSG Baghdad were specially configured with<br>increased video processing and dual flat panel monitors, allowing analysts simultaneous access<br>to a variety of applications and data.<br>(U//FOUO) Pictured below is the Officer In Charge position with the server equipment located to<br>the left.<br> <br>Work area in Baghdad <br>(U//FOUO) Pictured below are the Officer In Charge of CSG Baghdad, LtCol <br>and AS233 system administrators, Mr. <br>, CTM2 <br> USN, and SPC <br>USA.<br><br>USMC<br><br>,<br><br> <br>System administrators with Chief, CSG Baghdad <br>(U//FOUO) According to LtCol <br>, "The Viking server is working flawlessly...we have stressed<br>its capability and it has performed to the specified standards. We have had not one problem with<br>the Server configuration. The new Dell OPTIPLEX GX260 desktop workstations are holding up<br>extremely well - the Dell FS flat screen monitors are a big hit with the NSA VS targeting analysts<br>- especially the dual screen workstations. I believe it is safe to say that analytical work<br>productivity has increased by 20%. CSG Baghdad is now the 'flagship' of the IFC to show<br><br> </p>capabilities and briefings to VIPs and General Officers/Flag Officers off the dual flat screens. The<br>Dell FS flat screen monitors have markedly reduced eye fatigue and 'screen burnout' for the<br>young NSA VS analysts who sit on these workstation in excess of 16 hours a day...it does make<br>a difference."<br>(U) For additional information about a NIST or to volunteer for a NIST deployment, visit the<br>NIST/Field Sustainment page (or type "go NIST").<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
