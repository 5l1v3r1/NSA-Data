The next scenario addressed tactical SIGINT in a<br>counteroffensive responding to a North Korean attack and the final brainstorming session<br>concerned Phase IV operations in a newly-unified Korea. In all of these conversations, the<br>partners provided a unique perspective that energized the exchange and highlighted critical<br>gaps.<br>(S//SI//REL) Most important among these gaps was communications between and among the<br>US, Great Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Almost all of these difficulties are a direct<br>result of our agreements, policies and practices associated with the combined US-South Korean<br>(ROK) SIGINT partnership and, therefore, require creative thinking and/or policy changes to<br>resolve. For example, the current threat warning networks in the Korean Theater of Operations<br>(KTO) do not allow for Second Party access and most, if not all, computer networks in the KTO<br>are US-ROK or US only.<br>(S//SI//REL) Database access and Blue Forces data issues also figured prominently in<br>discussions. Lessons were drawn from our cooperation in other theaters, including Afghanistan<br>and Iraq. Finally, the Second Parties asked for permission to disseminate the new OPLANS to<br>their customers so that they can determine what their intelligence needs would be during a<br>Korean crisis - something about which most of the partners have, admittedly, not yet addressed<br>in any detail.<br>(S//SI//REL) Twenty-two nations, including the Five-Eyes community, have already signed the<br>still-extant 1950's-era U.N. resolution to defend South Korea if North Korea attacks. While many<br>sharing and cooperation issues exist with our Second Party partners, ROCK DRILL 6 made clear<br>that these issues will be magnified when it comes to sharing with other coalition partners, such<br>as the Philippines, Colombia and Luxembourg, to name a few. ROCK DRILL 6, therefore, was a<br>useful tool to raise the issue of intelligence sharing beyond the traditional US-ROK paradigm for<br>both Second Parties and others. Over the summer months, the KIMT will be working through<br>some of these problems, with the goal of exercising the resulting solutions sometime in early<br>2005.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any questions, please feel free to contact:<br>LT <br>Tim Miner (<br>Liz Brooks (<br><br> (<br><br>vc.di.nsa, NSTS <br>@nsa, NSTS<br>),<br>@nsa, NSTS <br>) or<br> (<br>@nsa, NSTS <br>),<br><br>),<br><br>...the NK IMT.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
