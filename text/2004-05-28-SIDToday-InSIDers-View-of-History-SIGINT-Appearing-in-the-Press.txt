Ms. Maklowski's response follows:<br>(S//SI) The one that comes to mind occurred in the mid-80's,<br>when I was working Polish Military Trade &amp; Aid, and President<br>Reagan was trying hard to convince a reluctant Congress to fund<br>the Contras in Nicaragua.<br>(S//SI) I'd been following a deal in the making between Cenzin,<br>the Polish government entity that handled foreign military sales,<br>and the pro-Soviet Sandinista government of Nicaragua for a (one)<br>helicopter (the Sandinistas were NOT big spenders). Poland<br>manufactured and sold a lot of helicopters, mostly for crop-dusting,<br>and I didn't track those sales, but when I got the specs on this one<br>and saw that it would be equipped with rocket launchers, I put out<br>a report.<br>(S//SI) When I got back into the office the morning after the<br>report was released, my branch chief asked me how much money<br>I'd gotten for my Washington Post article: he then showed me my<br>SIGINT report reproduced as an article in the Post. The only<br>change to the text I'd written and released was the lack of<br>classification. My guess is that the White House, which was looking<br>for anything that would help make a case with Congress for support<br>for the Contras, just unilaterally decided to release the SIGINT to<br>the press, without asking and without sanitization, as yet one more<br>piece of evidence of Soviet (well, sort of) support for the<br>Sandinistas.<br>(S//SI) Twenty-some years later, I have to admit that my outrage<br>at having a fragile SIGINT source put at risk so cavalierly was<br>tempered by a guilty sense of pride that the Post had not seen fit<br>to edit my text at all!<br>(U//FOUO) See other editions of InSIDer's View of History :<br>A Lesson in Personal Accountability<br>How a Four Star General Once Waited for a Lowly Captain to<br>Finish Eating Lunch<br>In SHAPE, In France<br>"Soviet Rocket" Strikes Chicksands<br>Onboard Air Force 2 Bound for Moscow<br>Testifying Before Congress...
