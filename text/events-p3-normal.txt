Social events arc currently being defined by the new Actor-Action ICD - see PPF APPS Actor Action
Event. Still in draft, this is to cover events where the user is interacting with a subject (c.g. another
communicant or object). There is no need for an active user in these events. Examples arc various, but
could include:

•	Webmail

•	Chat

•	Mobile apps will form new actions within the model c.g. User X sends MMS to User Y

[editl Geo reference Event

Geo Reference Events provide information about the global communications network.

They will be geo-labelled using SAMREF or GEOFUS1QN as appropriate using the standard geo label
(as agreed by the Geo Team).

[editl Derived Events

Once some events have been collected, various analytics can be applied to derive useful relationships
between them:

feditl Convergence

ArrowRight.png See main article — Conversed Events

Converged Events is the association of events from different SIGINT universes, such as Telephony and
C2C, for a given target.

feditl Correlation

TDIs from collected events can be correlated together to form correlation records (c.g. in HARD ASSOC
between IMSI-TDI)

[editl Events Databases

GCHQ Events databases

•	SOCIAL ANTHROPOID - C2C Comms and Social events QFD. has replaced HAUSTORIUM.

•	SALAMANCA - Telephony events. Due to be subsumed into SOCIAL ANTHROPOID.

•	NGE Input Buffer - C2C events warehouse. User access is not usually direct, but via one of the
OFDs.

NSA Events databases and systems

•	ASSOCIATION - GSM events

•	BANYAN - Telephony events

•	MAINWAY - contact chaining

The NSA systems and databases above derive their metadata from the FASCIA data repository
