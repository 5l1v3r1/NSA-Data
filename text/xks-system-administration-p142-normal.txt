Retrieving Metadata and Content

■ Queries complete and metadata returns,
but there is no content.

•	The metadata in the XKEYSCORE viewer
displays the host and directory path of the content
file. Verify the content file exists using the Is -I
command. Trace a dataflow issue if the file does
not exists. If the content file exists, confirm the
httpd daemon is started on all slave systems. To
confirm the httpd daemon:

•	1. Type su - oper

•	2. Type xks status httpd

•	3. If the daemon is not on, type xks start
httpd
