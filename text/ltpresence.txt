(S//REL) On 9 May NSA established the European Cryptologic Center^H
(ECC) from what was formerly the European Security Operations
Center (ESOC). The ECC will fall organizationally under NSA/CSS

1 of 3

Europe and Africa (NCEUR/AF), This is more than just a name
change; it is furthering the commitment of the National Security
Agency to a long-term mission presence in Germany, The name and
accompanying organizational change reflect a recognition of the
broader mission being supported from the ECC, as well as the strengthening of the
analytic mission at the center,

(S//REL) In addition to the well-established SIGINT analytic and collection
management missions, there is now an NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC)
and IT component to the center, ECC's enhanced analytic mission is a welcome
development. The organization is a critical enterprise partner in the CT, Africa, and
Middle East missions,

(S//REL) Since its beginnings in 2004 as the European Security Center (ESC), the
ECC has been a success story in terms of SIGINT mission accomplishments and
growth. In the last four years alone, the ECC's Analysis and Production mission set
has increased from 5 to 26 distinct assigned missions, becoming the largest
Analysis and Production activity in Europe, Complementing this rapid mission
expansion has been an increased collaborative effort with foreign partners, with
multiple IC members, and across the SIGINT Enterprise,

(S//REL) The quality and significance of ECC's SIGINT accomplishments speak for
themselves. In the last month alone, ECC was a key contributor to the arrests of
two key terrorist personalities, underscoring its refined collaborative environment.
Overall, ECC products are included in the President's Daily Brief (PDB) on average
twice a week. Further, for the second time in as many years, the ECC recently
received an Honorable Mention citation in competition for the prestigious Travis
Trophy award,

(S//REL) Located in Darmstadt, Germany, the ECC currently has a total of 240
personnel, a diverse mix of military service members, Department of the Army
civilians, NSA civilians, and contractors. The ECC has responded to new
intelligence priorities generated by the standup of AFRICOM, and has assumed
new TOPI responsibilities in both the US European Command (EUCOM) and US
Africa Command (AFRICOM) areas of responsibility,

(U//FOUO) Please join us in congratulating the ECC and its outstanding workforce
on their accomplishments and welcoming them as NSA's newest cryptologic center.
