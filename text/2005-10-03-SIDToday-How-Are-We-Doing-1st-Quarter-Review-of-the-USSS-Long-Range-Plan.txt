read it at: placemat.pdf (or type "go placemat" in your browser).
(U//FOUO) MG Quirk and the SIGINT leadership developed a Long Range Plan that outlines key
implementation plans and milestones for reaching the USSS strategic goals. Perhaps you're
wondering how SID is making progress towards achieving its Long Range Plan? Or maybe you
wonder how the work you're doing fits into the big plan? Well, wonder no more! SID has
completed its 1st-Quarter Long Range Plan Review, providing a forum to track performance and
demonstrate greater accountability for results.
(U//FOUO) You can find the 1st-Quarter Review at the S01X SIGINT Planning, Programming and
Performance home page , by clicking on Long Range Plans - 1st-QTR Review . ( Note for viewing
the briefing: If you double-click on each goal, it will expand to full size. ) The review contains
information on the key activities briefed at a leadership session held September 6, 2005. The
complete Long Range Plan contains milestones for many additional activities. Look for those to
be reviewed in subsequent quarters. The plans will be updated in March of 2006.
