(repost)<br>FROM: <br>Chief, Cryptologic Services Group, CIA (F52)<br>Run Date: 12/08/2004<br><br>(S) Are you interested in being on the front line for selecting SIGINT to brief the President, his<br>Cabinet, and Intelligence Community officials? Working as NSA's representative in the DCI<br>Operations Center (where the CSG is located) is definitely interesting.<br>(S) Not long ago, I briefed the newly-appointed DCI on how the Intelligence Community's<br>CRITIC program works (following some excellent GRSOC* CRITIC reporting). During that<br>exchange of information, Mr. Goss asked me, "Does the President have this information?" After<br>assuring him that the President was informed, I thought to myself: "Wow...this is definitely work<br>supporting the very top of the government!"<br>(S) Our big responsibility here in the CSG is to support the Presidential briefers. We select the<br>SIGINT each day that meets their reporting thresholds for briefing their principals. We have an<br>intimate, constructive relationship with the briefers, and they make us proud each day by telling<br>us that SIGINT is often the best intelligence that is shown to the President -- at home or on the<br>road -- as well as to the Secretary of Defense, State, the National Security Advisor, and other<br>Cabinet-level officials. We also brief senior DCI officials, to include the A/DCI for Collection, the<br>National Intelligence Council Chairman, and officials from CIA's Office of Collection Strategies<br>and Analysis.<br>(U//FOUO) CIA also has some very interesting people that come through the Operations Center.<br>In just the last month, baseball star Cal Ripken Jr. and movie celebrity Robert DeNiro were both<br>here -- at our desk -- receiving an unclassified view of how the DCI directs Intelligence<br>Community operations.<br>(U) At the end of the day, however, the real benefit to being part of the CSG CIA is knowing<br>that you are on the intel front line -- and that's incredibly rewarding.
