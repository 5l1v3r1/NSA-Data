An important outcome of<br>the conference is to identify positive steps that can be taken in the coming year to improve our<br>SIGDEV capabilities by working as a community on some of the toughest SIGDEV challenges.<br>(S//SI) We will kick off the conference in Friedman Auditorium on Monday 21 June with a<br>keynote address, followed by State of SIGINT Development reports by SIGDEV Leaders from<br>NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB. The remainder of the conference will consist of a series of<br>focused workshops, usually in smaller conference rooms -- relatively short briefings and tool<br>demonstrations geared toward generating the exchange of ideas among the participants. This<br>year, we are planning workshops on the following topics:<br>Physically Locating Targets (including geolocation)<br>Unified Events Analysis/Discovering New Targets<br>Network Analysis<br>Broadband Access and Survey<br>SIGDEV Support to Tactical Operations and Force Protection<br>Non-SIGINT Support to SIGINT Development<br>and more.....<br>(U) Visit the SD2004 website often. We will be continuously adding new information as workshop<br>leaders, agenda and other details are confirmed. If you are interested in leading a topical<br>discussion within one of the identified tracks, please send an abstract of your proposed talk to<br>either the workshop leader or the conference alias <br>or DL SDCONF). We will also<br>consider presentations on topics outside the main threads, scheduling them as sidebar sessions<br>throughout the week.<br>(U) So, mark your calendars... start making plans to attend; we need your participation to<br>ensure the success of SD2004. The conference is open to all fully cleared personnel. Contractors<br>are welcome, but should be currently performing SIGINT Development work.<br> <br><br>) <br> GCHQ Integree (<br> <br>SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
