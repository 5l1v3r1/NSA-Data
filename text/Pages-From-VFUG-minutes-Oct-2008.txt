Speaker identification systems (SID^

Result:

A couple of months ago we deployed a 5-way speaker id system against a network
of high level individuals involved with the Afghan narcotics trade. The system has
been put to imaginative use by OPI~LANG/OPI~SC in that it is running against a
whole zip code that brings in a large amount of traffic. This has enabled some
speculative tasking of further selectors seeking more communications for these
targets and allowing the linguists to effectively filter out unwanted calls. The principal,
the main subject of SOCA OP BRABILLA, was arrested last week in Jakarta and is
now to stand trial in the US on charges related to the narcotics industry and
supporting attacks on US soldiers in Afghanistan. The speaker id system contributed
to this success by identifying 2 new numbers for this principal target and thus helped
to keep track of his activities right up to the time of his arrest.

The system will now be re-built to target the remaining 4 narco barons and will
hopefully produce some similarly effective results.
