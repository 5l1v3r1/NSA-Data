(U//FOUO) S2C41 surge effort

(TS//SI//REL) NSA's Mexico Leadership Team (S2C41) conducted a two-
week target development surge effort against one of Mexico's leading
presidential candidates, Enrique Pena Nieto, and nine of his close
associates. Nieto is considered by most political pundits to be the likely
winner of the 2012 Mexican presidential elections which are to be held
in July 2012. SATC leveraged graph analysis in the development
surge's target development effort.
