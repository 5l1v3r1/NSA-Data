Well, almost....<br>(U//FOUO) Notwithstanding the detailed planning and training that preceded the transfer, there<br>was the usual outbreak of frayed nerves and user anxiety that seems to accompany<br>organizational change of any kind. For the most part, however, analysts and reporters continued<br>to receive rapid, effective solutions to their problems during the transition period. Actually,<br>service has improved steadily over the past six months as our ITI* first-responders have gained<br>experience in handling and routing requests for help. Nevertheless, the Reporting Tools Branch<br>and ITSC continue to monitor the process and have a few suggestions we hope will greatly<br>improve your customer service experience.<br>(U//FOUO) ITSC continues to receive a high volume of help requests dealing with<br>SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE and SOD user accounts and group permissions. One way that analysts<br>can help reduce the number of these requests is to take advantage of the many<br>experienced users who abound throughout the analytical groups. Often, just by asking a<br>colleague, an analyst can get the answer to questions without initiating a formal ticket and the<br>tracking activity that often ensues.<br>(U//FOUO) Almost as important as the expert users who can help in a pinch are the numerous<br>working aids and references that are available. For help using SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE,<br>there are links to numerous aids on the SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE homepage ("go skywriter" or "go<br>hightide"); these include the system users manual and the SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE/SKYCAST<br>working aid. For SOD, the homepage ("go sigint on demand" or "go sod") also has links to an<br>excellent on-line users guide and new workings aids for the autosource and multimedia<br>functions. In addition to these formal documents, there are "home grown" working aids available<br>in most of the analytical offices. Get to know who has or maintains them and what they can do<br>for you.<br>(U//FOUO) Lastly, getting requests to the right office will often expedite resolution of most<br>problems. The most common help requests not related to SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE and SOD,<br>involve metrics, policy, or storage and retrieval. The following offices are well equipped to<br>respond to requests for information on these topics:<br>Metrics: <br>Reporting Policy: <br>Storage/Retrieval of Product Reports: <br>(U//FOUO) But remember, SERVICE is the mission of ITSC and the Reporting Tools Branch. If<br>you can't get local help in solving your problem quickly, if the available references and working<br>aids don't seem to help, or if you simply don't have the time to bother with these and need help<br>fast, by all means, <br>, or submit a trouble ticket via the<br>Information Technology Support Center web site ("go itsc"). The ITSC will either provide a<br>response or route your request to an office or person who can.<br><br> </p>(U) Notes: <br>*ITI = Information Technology Infrastructure <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
