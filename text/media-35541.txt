Mathematical Information Processing Research Task:
TOR deanonymisation

Customer: 
Status: in (started
December 2010)

Can we denonymise In
other words, if given some
traf?c from a TOR exit node,
can we ?nd the IP address of
the user associated with that
traf?c?

[edit] Research

A circuit tracing attack was
?rst considered. However
signatures run by
TDSD showed that our
coverage of TOR is too low to
have a reasonable chance of
doing such an attack; on
JTRIG paths we only saw 2
out of 8294 potential inter?
TOR?node links.

Instead we are now

considering an entry?exit correlation attack. Data collected from
infrastructure showed that some timing structure is
preserved between entry and exit node.

The successful outcome of this entry?exit correlation attack is documented in
An package implementing the attack is available: 
doc.

The work was presented at SANAR1 1. The slides are here.

We plan to prototype the technique in the REMATION II workshop. The
introductory slides are here.
