	OPC-MCR Mathematical Information Processing Research Task:  TOR deanonymisation	

Customer: ICTR-NE
Status: in pullthrough (started
December 2010)

Can we denonymise TOR? In
other words, if given some
traffic from a TOR exit node,
can we find the IP address of
the user associated with that
traffic?

[edit] Research

A circuit tracing attack was
first considered. However
ICTR-NE signatures run by
TDSD showed that our
coverage of TOR is too low to
have a reasonable chance of
doing such an attack; on
JTRIG paths we only saw 2
out of 8294 potential inter-
TOR-node links.

Instead we are now
considering an entry-exit correlation attack. Data collected from
ICTR-NE/JTRIG infrastructure showed that some timing structure is
preserved between entry and exit node.

The successful outcome of this entry-exit correlation attack is documented in
QPC-M/TECH.B/61. An R package implementing the attack is available: src.
doc.

The work was presented at SANAR11. The slides are here.

We plan to prototype the technique in the REMATION II workshop. The
introductory slides are here.
