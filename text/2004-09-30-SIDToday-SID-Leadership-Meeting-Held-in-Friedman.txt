The team, consisting of SIGINT Director MG<br>Quirk, Deputy Director Charlie Meals, DDCR <br> DDAP Carl Johnson, Deputy DDDA<br>Jim Cusick, and SID Technical Director Dave Hurry, spoke to the audience of SID leaders and<br>managers about the future of SID as a cryptologic expeditionary force. This concept extends<br>from the Director's message of NSA becoming a global SIGINT system.**<br>(S) In response to the new global concept, SIGINT Director MG Quirk discussed the topic of<br>governance and how SID is responsible for tying all of the missions throughout the Extended<br>Enterprise together. He impressed upon the room full of managers and technical leaders that it<br>will be the job of SID leadership to make this global governance effort a successful one.<br>(S) A major component of NSA responding to the need for SIGINT to be a global operation is<br>mission dispersal -- the term used to connote the movement of some SIGINT missions to the<br>various RSOCs and Mission Ground Stations around the world. MG Quirk and Mr. Meals<br>explained that mission dispersal will not necessarily entail a mass movement of personnel from<br>Fort Meade, instead there will be a combination of hiring on location and some PCSing.<br>(S) Mission dispersal was a hot topic throughout the meeting. After MG Quirk offered his<br>perspective on how the Signals Intelligence Directorate is affected by this new global concept,<br>each of the Deputy Directors presented their thoughts on their respective organizations' role in<br>this process. A discussion of this issue carried over into the question-and-answer session, with<br>SID leadership seated in a panel formation. Questions came from the audience and phone-ins<br>from across the Extended Enterprise.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Meals unveiled the SID Leadership's new communications initiative called "chain<br>training". This process requires a leader to meet with the personnel 1 and 2 echelons down from<br>their position to pass along information and to provide a more candid and open structure for<br>discussing new issues, or for expressing concerns. In the future, in addition to SID Town<br>Meetings for the entire SID workforce, the Signals Intelligence Director and Deputy Director will<br>meet with the DD's and the DD's immediate reports. (There will be more detail on "chain<br>training" in upcoming articles on SID today .)<br>(U//FOUO) The briefing slides from Monday's meeting are available for viewing.<br>**Note: <br>(U//FOUO) The Director unveiled this concept at the 9/11 remembrance held in the Friedman<br>Auditorium on September 13, 2004. The Director's address can be heard by clicking on " 9/11<br>Operational Remembrance " under Corporate Videos on the NSA Daily webpage . He expanded<br>on the concept in DIRgram-330: " Iraq: Our Plan to Support the Evolving National Strategy ". <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
