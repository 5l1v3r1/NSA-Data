(U) POTENTIAL LANDMINES:

0 There is a chance that helping attribute the cybe attacks against the French
Presidential network may reveal a US. ally is responsible.

0 The French have not been forthcoming in sharing technical details of the
cyber attacks. Thee is suspicion that the information is not being shared prior to the visit
because the French want to see how NSA responds when they present their ?ndings.
During the January 2013 DIRNSA visit to Paris, both DGSE and ANSSI asked GEN
Alexander about the cybe attacks in an attempt to ascertain whether or not the US. was
responsible for the attacks (as reported in Frerch magazines). At no time was FAD made
aware that DGSE and AN 881 intended to raise the issue with DIRNSA.

(U) OTHER INFORMATION:

0 TAO con?rmed that this was not a TAO operation. TAO asked most of
close Party Partners whethe they wee involved (CIA, GCHQ, and CSEC
were the mostly likely suspects); everyone has denied involvement. TAO intentionally

TOP SEC 

TOP SEC 
did not ask e'the Mossad or ISNU whethe they wee involved as France is not an
approved target for joint discussion.

After repeated requests for technical information relating to the cybe attacks (in
advance of the visit), ANSSI and DGSE have not provided any details.

(U) RECENT PRESS INDICATIONS:

(U) The cyber attacks against the French Presidential network took place in May 2012.
An initial press report from Paris Atlantico, ?French Web site says Turkish Hackers
Bdiind Elvsee C?e Attacks." dated 12 July 2012, stated it was believed ?the attacks
originated from France's allies" and speculated Turkish hackes with possible links to
Turkish ?intelligence services or government bodies" might be responsible. No follow-on
press reports have been seen that place blame on Turkey. A press report from Paris

1. Express, ?French Weeklv on Alleged US Cybe Espionage Attack on Elvsee
Palace." dated 20 November 2012. shifted blame for the attacks toward the United States.

On 27 Novembe 2012, @rrct sur images contacted the Paris I. author who
shared thee are an ?array of assumptions? that enable pointing to the United States as the
origin of this attack. Pan's Express contacted ANSSI and the Elysee; both declined to
comment.
