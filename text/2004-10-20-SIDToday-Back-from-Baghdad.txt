Mr. Cronin returned from<br>Baghdad last month and told us of his experiences there. Here is the "after" part of his story...<br>(C) How was his tour? Well, in a nutshell, Mr. Cronin describes it as "a great experience" -- the<br>best tour he's had in 28 years in the cryptologic community. His primary concern in Baghdad<br>was the health and safety of the people under his supervision, and fortunately no one was<br>injured during his 101 days on site. However, the long periods of quiet were punctuated by<br>moments of sheer terror. A trying point in his tour occurred when the site experienced mortar<br>attacks for five consecutive nights. Their workplaces were hit twice -- once by a mortar and<br>once by a rocket. Although one of the attacks caused "amazing" damage, both of the State<br>department personnel near the blast survived, with one of them being sent back to the States<br>for medical treatment.<br> <br>Mortar round hits roof <br> <br>Damage inside work area <br>(U//FOUO) During Mr. Cronin's tour, the Coalition Provisional Authority, under Ambassador Paul<br>Bremer, handed over governing authority to the Iraq Transitional Government. This marked a<br>major change, as the U.S. officials were now advisors, as opposed to decision-makers. The early<br>handover, on May 28 instead of June 1st, was designed to disrupt any planed terrorist activity.<br>This date change was a well kept secret even among the inner circle at the Embassy. Both<br>Ambassador Bremer and the U.S. Ambassador to the new government, John Negroponte, were<br>avid users of SIGINT. On more than one occasion, Ambassador Bremer made a major policy<br>decision based on SIGINT information alone.<br>(S) His tour also coincided with the start of Cryptologic Support Team (CST) deployments of<br>SIGINTers to work with military division-level personnel in Iraq. Mr. Cronin believes that this<br>was a good idea, and he expects the effort to be a success. He added that this will give the<br>SIGINT system better insight into U.S. tactical operations.<br>(C) The feedback Mr. Cronin received on NSA's SIGINT was extremely positive -- he found both<br>our military and political customers to be very satisfied with what they were receiving. In fact,<br>customers relied on SIGINT to an even greater degree than he expected. They considered<br>SIGINT to be their key source for information they couldn't get anywhere else. Customers told<br>Mr. Cronin (and the NSA Director, when he visited), to "Keep doing what you are doing."<br>(C) Policy-makers want to hear more than SIGINT fact from NSA -- they appreciated analyst's<br>comments, and considered SIGINT assessment reports to be "pure gold." Customers went out of<br>their way to ask for more. Mr. Cronin also found the Iraq IMT* to be a "great, one-stopshopping" way of communicating with elements back at Fort Meade. He also had very productive<br>dealings with NSOC , and established good working relationships with the SOOs**.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Cronin did have some limited opportunities to mix with the Iraqi population, such<br>as in a marketplace. His impression was that the Iraqis were happy to be rid of the Saddam<br>Hussein regime, but resented the U.S. occupation of their country. The heat and dust in Iraq are<br>worse than he anticipated (the daily high temperature was never below 100 degrees during his<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">entire tour), but the living quarters were better than he expected.<br>(S) In terms of his daily routine, Mr. Cronin attended a 0630 meeting with General Casey 6 days<br>per week, and an 0830 Ambassador's Country Team meeting 4 times per week. Beyond that,<br>however, there was no regular "routine" to his day. As Ambassador Bremer stated, "There are<br>three days in Iraq - yesterday, today, and tomorrow." Because of the time difference between<br>the U.S. and Iraq, Mr. Cronin's workday (typically lasting 15 hours for 101 days straight), was<br>divided into an "Iraq day" and a "U.S. day." SIGINT analysts in country (about 100, in total)<br>usually worked shifts of 12-hours-on/12-hours-off. Despite the hardships, the SIGINTers in<br>country had "overall, extremely high morale."<br>(C) Mr. Cronin learned a lot during his tour and had unforgettable experiences. Would he do it<br>again? Yes, he would. What's next for him? -- He's now headed off to Thailand to begin language<br>training prior to his assignment as NCR Thailand in the Summer of 2005.<br>(U) Notes: <br>*IMT = Issue Management Team <br>**SOO = Senior Operations Officers <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
