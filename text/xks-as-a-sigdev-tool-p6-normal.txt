"Slowing down the Internet"

XKS goal is to store the full-take
content for 3-5 days, effectively
"slowing down the Internet" so that
analysts can go back and recover
sessions that otherwise would have
been dropped by the front end

Meta-data is saved off longer, with the
goal of 30 days retention

A lot of analysis can be done through
meta-data only (MARINA is meta-data
only)
