Every day<br>ANDA analysts are able to provide customers an accurate view into a target network of interest<br>by searching through a myriad of data sources and making keen analytical judgments based on<br>data that is found. The rapid growth of worldwide telecommunications networks makes the job of<br>a Network Analyst increasingly more complex as the amount of data to search through is quickly<br>becoming larger and larger.<br>(S//SI) A group of analysts within ANDA are working to develop quicker and more efficient ways<br>of "hunting versus fishing" through network metadata in order to provide accurate network<br>analysis results in half the time that it takes a network analyst to perform that same job today.<br>This talk will provide an overview of the vision and philosophy behind the working prototype as<br>well as a live demo of the ideas already developed.<br>(U//FOUO) Registration : To register for this event, please send an e-mail to "dl sdconf" (or<br>sdconf@nsa) indicating your interest or call <br> and ask for either <br> or <br> As we are limited to 45 participants for each session due to<br>room size, selections will be made on a first come, first served basis and your registration will be<br>confirmed via e-mail.
