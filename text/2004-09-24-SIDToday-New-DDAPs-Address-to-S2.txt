Jim's efforts have positioned<br>A&amp;P on a course to be successful over the coming years and we will miss him dearly. We wish<br>Jim and his family Godspeed and prosperity.<br>(U//FOUO) I'm honored to lead Analysis and Production and humbled to be re-associated with<br>this fine work force. I'm committed to further transforming A&amp;P to facilitate robust production<br>for the foreseeable future. My assignment feels very much like a homecoming and I'm tickled to<br>be back into the thick of analysis. For the meanwhile, I will continue the policies and activities<br>that SID and Jim have put into place for A&amp;P. I will NOT make immediate, sweeping, or<br>significant changes right away; although, I'm keenly aware of the need to provide our work<br>force with stable IT and adequate analytic and reporting tools. That said, I will work hard to<br>facilitate these infrastructure changes quickly throughout the entire enterprise. I look forward to<br>visiting our production and analytic centers soon, both here at NSAW and across the enterprise.<br>(U) Analysis and Production's superior performance is well known across the IC and our client<br>base. I'm confident we will continue this stellar work and that you will continue making<br>significant contributions to our clients' success and the defense of the nation. We will celebrate<br>mightily and we'll ensure that our people understand the great work they perform and the<br>impact it has on the nation.<br>(U) You will be hearing more from me as I gain a stronger foundation on the mission and tasks<br>before us. Again, I'm thrilled to be back and I look forward to reacquainting myself with A&amp;P and<br>to be working with old friends. Although my schedule is hectic, my door is open. People are most<br>important to me and I will make time. Together, we'll continue the great work A&amp;P is known to<br>produce while transforming to remain relevant.<br>Carl<br>Carl L.
