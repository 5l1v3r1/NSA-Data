■	Computers requiring shared access to the
/export/data/xkeyscore directory must be told
where to find the directory.

• This is accomplished via automounting.

■	The autofs daemon listens for computers
trying to connect to the directories, or mounts,
that it is responsible for.

■	The mounts are dropped after a time out, but
autofs remounts the drive when drives need
to be accessed.
