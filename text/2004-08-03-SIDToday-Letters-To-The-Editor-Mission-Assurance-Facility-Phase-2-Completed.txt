That article was based upon an email I wrote to General Quirk, but<br>was modified.<br>(S//REL) Unless you read the modified version carefully, a reader could come away with the<br>impression that Phase 2 is completed. In point of fact, the <br> Phase 2 "facility" is<br>completed, however Phase 2 in totality is not. None of the Phase 2 mission has yet been<br>populated (although as stated some boxes have started to arrive).<br>(U) I really do appreciate the visibility that SIDtoday brings to the <br> mission and to the<br>people who worked so hard to make this project a success. However, I do believe a correction is<br>in order to avoid misunderstandings on the part of your readers.<br>Thanks, <br><br>(U) Point taken. ed.<br>No Further text<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
