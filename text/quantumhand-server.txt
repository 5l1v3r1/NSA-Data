(TS//SI//NF) QUANTUMTHEORY (QT) is a set of CNO Man-on-the-Side capabilities that involve
real-time responses to passive collection. After the recent TURMOIL upgrade at SSO’s SARATOGA
access, TAO operators were able to run QUANTUMHAND which exploits the computer of a target
accessing his facebook account. Briefly, when quantum is tipped that a target is using Facebook,
quantum pretends to be the Facebook server and sends a response to the target. This fake response
contains a link to TAO's FOXACID server, which implants the target’s computer. In just a week,
nearly 100 “shots” have been fired on 14 targets using QUANTUM from over 1300 tips received
from SARATOGA. More targets are being added. This collaboration between TD, SSG, TAO, and
SSO is another successful example of the emerging emphasis on Endpoint-Midpoint Integration.
