(S//SI//REL) Project Overview: The mission of the AURORAGOLD (AG) project is to maintain
data about international GSM/UMTS networks for the Wireless Portfolio Program Office
(WPMO), the Target Technology Trends Center (T3C/SSG4), and their customers. Analysis of this
data supports:

a)	An understanding of the current state,

b)	Trending, or time-series analysis, from the past through to the future, and

c)	Forecasting of the evolution of global GSM/UMTS-based networks.

This analysis and developmental activity is currently focusing only on GSM/UMTS infrastructure,
voice-data convergence, UMTS technology migration, and UMTS technology deployments.
Coincident beneficiaries of this mission are, among others, other NSA SIGDEV elements, protocol
exploitation elements, and Five-Eyes Partner SIGDEV organizations.

(C//REL) Alignment: Supports NSA's and SID's imperative to "Know the Future."

(C//REL) Sponsors: WPMO/S3W

(C//REL) Customers: WPMO/S3W; T3C/SSG4; Various S3 collections organizations;
numerous IC organizations

(C//REL) Architecture and Infrastructure: Custom-built application based on OZONE
framework, using GOLDENCARRIAGE corporate servers for all application and data
storage

(S//SI//REL) Corpus:

Will contain:

•	Unclassified: Complete replica of Informa Telecoms and Media's World Cellular Information Service
(WCIS) queryable database to eventually compare data against that collected from SIGINT

•	Classified: SIGINT-collected IR.21 (International Roaming agreements) documents from around the
world, parsed of their information, analyzed, and giving users the ability to trend this information
over time (time-series analysis). In addition, e-mail selectors from within IR.21s and from SIGINT
metadata captured, analyzed and managed back into the SIGINT system for enhanced collection

(C//REL) Content:

•	Portion of the WCIS data available via NSANet GUI; remainder to be completed within 2-3 months

•	Currently, Phase 1 contains a small database of worldwide wireless networks being compared
against IR.21s from SIGINT to establish our "baseline"

(C//REL) Capabilities:

•	Soon, complete WCIS repository to be copied to NSANet for querying by all NSA and 2P
Partners

•	Later, agile querying through entire IR.21 and WCIS databases, with capability to perform time-
series analysis via visualization application
