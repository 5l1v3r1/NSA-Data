data about international networks for the Wireless Portfolio Program Office
(WPMO), the Target Technology Trends Center and their customers. Analysis of this
data supports:

a) An understanding of the current state,

b) Trending, or time-series analysis, from the past through to the future, and

c) Forecasting of the evolution of global networks.
This analysis and developmental activity is currently focusing only on infrastructure,
voice-data convergence, UMTS technology migration, and UMTS technology deployments.
Coincident beneficiaries of this mission are, among others, other NSA SIGDEV elements, protocol
exploitation elements, and Five-Eyes Partner SIGDEV organizations.

Alignment: Supports and SlD?s imperative to ?Know the Future.?
Sponsors: 

Customers: Various S3 collections organizations;
numerous IC organizations

Architecture and Infrastructure: Custom-built application based on OZONE
framework, using GOLDENCARRIAGE corporate servers for all application and data

TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBRCorpus:

Will contain:

- Unclassified: Complete replica of Informa Telecoms and Media?s World Cellular Information Service
(WCIS) queryable database to eventually compare data against that collected from SIGINT

- Classified: SIGINT-collected (International Roaming agreements) documents from around the
world, parsed of their information, analyzed, and giving users the ability to trend this information
over time (time-series analysis). In addition, e-mail selectors from within |R.21s and from SIGINT
metadata captured, analyzed and managed back into the SIGINT system for enhanced collection

Content:

- Portion of the WCIS data available via remainder to be completed within 2-3 months
- Currently, Phase 1 contains a small database of worldwide wireless networks being compared
against |R.21s from SIGINT to establish our ?baseline?

Capabilities:
- Soon, complete WCIS repository to be copied to for querying by all NSA and 2P
Partners
- Later, agile querying through entire and WCIS databases, with capability to perform time-
series analysis via visualization application
