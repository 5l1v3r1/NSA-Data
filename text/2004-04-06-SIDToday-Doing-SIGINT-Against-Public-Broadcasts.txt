The Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) regularly reports the content of<br>these open broadcasts.<br>(S//SI) Times change. Some of NSA's combatant command customers have articulated SIGINT<br>Information Needs on the technical details of communications that carry open broadcasts.<br>During OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, the identification and location of Iraqi Satellite Television<br>became a high priority.<br>(S//SI) The question of NSA's authority to conduct SIGINT against such targets has been<br>reviewed by the Office of General Counsel's Operations Practice Group with the following result:<br>"NSA can intercept and process foreign press, propaganda and other open broadcast signals for<br>the purpose of deriving technical data concerning such signals. Any of this technical data that is<br>of foreign intelligence value can be reported to appropriate customers. NSA cannot do COMINT<br>reporting on the content of such transmissions; this is the responsibility of other organizations."<br>(U//FOUO) See a Staff Processing Form on the subject.<br>(U//FOUO) It is prudent to note that Information Needs relating to press, propaganda and other<br>public broadcasts are subject to the same National SIGINT Requirements Process criteria for<br>validation and prioritization as any other requirements.<br>(C) POC for this message is <br><br> IWSC Capabilities Branch (S1521), <br><br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
