(TS//SI//REL) POISONNUT, also known as the Virtual Private Network Attack Orchestrator (VAO), is a message driven cryptologic
exploitation service for VPNs with the main focus on IPSec. Currently, the list of POISONNUT clients includes TURMOIL,
WEALTHYCLUSTER and the TEe. Each POISONNUT client can connect to POISONNUT using 1SLANDTRANSPORT. Once
connected to POISONNUT, clients send and receive XML messages encrypted using ISLANDH1DEAWAY.

(U) Development Process and Standards

(U//FOUO) POISONNUT follows the LONGHAUL Development Process which uses the NSA Way.

(U) History

(TS//S1//REL) The VPN Attack Orchestrator (VAO) has existed in various configurations since 2003. Originally developed as a
standalone application by the Network Security Products branch, the later became a key crypt application integrated with
corporate collection frameworks such as WC2 andTURMOIL. As of 2006, the Heritage VAO, as it is now known, was stood up inside
of a JBoss server. In November 2008, a new development effort was stood up in order to increase the throughput and stability of
the VAO. The new VAO system, under the cover term POISONNUT, has a major development milestone scheduled for September
2009. POISONNUT is the first component which will be available under the LONGHAUL project. This new development is being
undertaken by developers in the T342P and the S31243 VPN Team.
