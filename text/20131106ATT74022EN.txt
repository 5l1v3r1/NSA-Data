Abstract: In the wake of the disclosures surrounding PRISM and other US
surveillance programmes, this briefing paper makes an assessment of the large-
scale surveillance practices by a selection of EU member states: the UK, Sweden,
France, Germany and the Netherlands. Given the large-scale nature of surveillance
practices at stake, which represent a reconfiguration of traditional intelligence
gathering, the paper contends that an analysis of European surveillance
programmes cannot be reduced to a question of balance between data protection
versus national security, but has to be framed in terms of collective freedoms and
democracy. It finds that four of the five EU member states selected for in-depth
examination are engaging in some form of large-scale interception and
surveillance of communication data, and identifies parallels and discrepancies
between these programmes and the NSA-run operations. The paper argues that
these surveillance programmes do not stand outside the realm of EU intervention
but can be engaged from an EU law perspective via a critical understanding of
national security in a democratic rule of law framework, the risks presented to the
security of the Union as a whole, and the potential spillover into the security
activities of EU agencies. The paper then presents a set of policy recommendations
to the European Parliament.

3.	Session III will discuss the nature and effectiveness of parliamentary oversight in
the Member States based on the contribution of experts from the Venice
Commission, academia, national intelligence community and civil society.

4.	In Session IV Members of the EU-US transatlantic experts group will inform the
LIBE Committee Inquiry of the discussions that took place in this group on 6
November.
