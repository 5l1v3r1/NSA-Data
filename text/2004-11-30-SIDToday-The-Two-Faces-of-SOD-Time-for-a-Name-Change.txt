It doesn't know whether it is a tool<br>or a product or both. Having the same name for the tool that we use to produce the SIGINT-On<br>Demand (SOD) item and the resulting SOD product is confusing to customers, the users of the<br>information, and to us, the users and developers of the tool. To end the confusion, we're<br>changing the analyst's piece to the Content Preparation Environment (CPE).<br>(U//FOUO) Doing so will make it easier for us to differentiate between the CPE's broad range of<br>functions and SOD the product. The CPE has also been assigned the covername SPELLBINDER.<br>This name will be used primarily for accreditation purposes and internal communications.<br>(U//FOUO) Is it a name-only change? No, there really is a difference. As the CPE evolves,<br>analysts will be able to prepare ANY information in this space -- from traditional text to<br>multimedia, ORCON, GAMMA, technical information, and even products from the IAD and the<br>newly-established NTAC. The first steps in this evolution are being prototyped. We're testing the<br>use of MS Word within the CPE and recently incorporated the ability to attach multimedia<br>information. In the longer term, we envision an analyst will create responses to Research<br>Information Needs (RIN) within the CPE and, with only a click or two, deliver these responses to<br>customers as RIN responses AND formally disseminate the information as a regular product.<br>(U//FOUO) So, what does that mean for SOD the product? For now, a SOD item is the only<br>product/format choice available in the CPE. However, now that SOD items are sent via<br>subscription AND via Criticom to a canned distribution, a number of production elements use<br>SOD much like an EGRAM. In the future, SOD will simply be one of many CPE product choices<br>when you prepare information for dissemination. The goal is to transparently streamline the<br>ways analysts prepare and disseminate information.<br>(U//FOUO) We'll be providing regular updates on the Content Preparation Environment. Our plan<br>is to rollout new capabilities every 6-8 weeks; the next roll out is scheduled for January 2005.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
