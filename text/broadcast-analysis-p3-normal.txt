Context

1.1	Internet Radio is a technology that allows audio streams, usually based
on MP3 or AAC formats, to be broadcast over the Internet to clients in real-
time.

Details

1.2	This report documents the results of an analysis into data derived from
on-line broadcasting, or “Internet radio”. This technology allows users
to broadcast audio via the internet without the restrictions traditionally
associated with broadcasting.

1.1	The technology covers protocols such as “Shoutcast”, “Icecast” and
“Peercast”. Further details of the technology are summarised in report
4134544 [1]

1.2	The interception capability was delivered under Strategic Framework
Task 4134544 by TR-CISA and was deployed at CPC in the PPF
framework.

1.3	A sample of the derived SIGINT data was taken over 3-month period (August-
October 2009). This sample represented 6.68 Million unique events from the
accesses feeding the research system. These accesses ranged between
STM1-STM64 from a range of sources.

1.4	In order to facilitate analysis, the data was tagged with the geographic location of
each IP addresses from the TR-NE research prototype GEOFUSION using slr-ip-
adr-lu-log.

1.5	The data was parsed to extract client-server and server-client relationships by using
the Broadcast-Server and Broadcast-Listener fields that the PPF AEG module output
to the single line records.

Analysis

2	Broadcast Population

2.1	There were 224,446 Unique listener IP addresses over the 3 month period
covering approximately 108448 /24 subnets.

3	Geographic Distribution of Servers

3.1	Servers were geographically distributed between 1719 individual locations. The Top 50
are shown in Table 1.
