Where<br>would we start the search? What kind of information should we<br>collect? From what sources? We can't search everywhere and just<br>hope we trip over the right data.<br>(U//FOUO) Understanding and analyzing a targeted network is<br>currently a labor-intensive process in which network analysts pore<br>through various data sources using a subset of semi-automated<br>tools. We simply do not have enough network analysts to<br>effectively monitor these targeted networks while continuing to<br>work newly developed or less understood protocols.<br>(S//SI) The answer is to integrate an automated functionality to<br>perform this work. To that end, a prototype development effort is<br>underway to establish the Data/Network Operations Center<br>(DNOC) within the Network Analysis Center (NAC) to construct and<br>monitor change on targeted networks. A development team<br>comprised of experts from industry, government, and academia<br>are collaborating on this enormous systems integration effort.<br>Their success will be dependent upon cooperation external to the<br>NAC.<br>(S//SI) Therefore, an Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been<br>established and is supported by over 60 representatives from over<br>30 organizations throughout SID. These individuals are contributing<br>to the development effort by raising both technical and<br>environmental issues, escalating those issues, and recommending<br>work-arounds and/or long-term solutions. A concept of operations<br>is due out in mid-March and the Spiral 1 prototype is scheduled for<br>June 2004.
