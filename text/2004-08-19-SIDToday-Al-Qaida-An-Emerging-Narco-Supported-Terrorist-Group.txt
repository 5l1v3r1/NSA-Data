As al-Qa'ida is a<br>nebulous organization that apparently has morphed into a more "flat" vice<br>hierarchical organization, efforts to understand the organization's level of<br>participation in narcotics trafficking and identify the personnel involved are<br>highly problematic. Despite this ambiguity:<br>there appears to be an intentional nexus of convenience between<br>narcotics producers/traffickers and low-level al-Qa'ida operatives;<br>there is no intelligence indicating mid- or high-level al-Qa'ida<br>personnel are involved in the drug trade; and,<br>key drivers and motivators for further al-Qa'ida involvement in the<br>drug trade include restricting the traditional terrorism sources of<br>revenue as well the elimination of its leadership.<br>(U//FOUO) Interested in learning more?
