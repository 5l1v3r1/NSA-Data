The "skinny" cloud (Laurel)

What is it?

•	A batch analytic HADOOP cluster

•	Contains all the data but for a short retention period

What would it be used for?

•	An ideal place to do incremental analytics

•	Answers the cross-site analytic problem

•	Could be dedicated to sustained usage

•	Provides some resilience by duplicating recent data

What are the challenges?

• Can we transfer and ingest all the data

Engineering could potential build this using on-order kit
