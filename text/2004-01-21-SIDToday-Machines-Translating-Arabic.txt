DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Machines Translating Arabic<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Run Date: 01/21/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>(U) NSAers are participating in a study to answer the question: "How good must Arabic machine<br>translation tools be to be operationally useful?"<br>(U) Since 2001, the U.S. Government's need for Arabic translation skills has surged<br>dramatically. With military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq ongoing, and Arabic linguists in<br>high demand, the government began several projects to develop an effective Arabic machine<br>translation (MT) tool. NAIC, Ft. Huachuca, CIA and DARPA all put funds into separate efforts.<br>Government officials soon realized that it would be smarter to concentrate the funding on the<br>one or two most promising projects, instead of scattering the money among several. The<br>question remained, however: which are most promising?<br>(U) To get to the bottom of this question, the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL),<br>formed last year at the University of Maryland, was tasked with conducting a task-based<br>evaluation of some of the Arabic MTs that were funded in 2003. (This evaluation was proposed<br>by John Kovarik, NSA's Senior Language Technology Authority.) Such a study is now underway.<br>With the help of NSA analysts, CASL will study how well three representative MTs -- each<br>representative of a different approach -- work for analysts who are not familiar with Arabic.<br>(U) The study will work like this: unclassified documents will be sent through the three systems.<br>The output will then be randomly presented to NSA analysts in such a way that they will not<br>know which system produced which output. The analysts will then read the documents and try<br>to answer various questions, based on what they have read. Software will grade the answers<br>and track how long the analysts take to answer the questions. These "grades" will then be<br>summed to measure how well the three MTs work.<br>(U) NSA analysts are currently being sought to volunteer to participate in the study.<br>Participants will be trained and take the "tests" at UMd on January 26. If you are interested in<br>volunteering, please contact John Kovarik (<br>nsa;<br>) or Lynn Carlson (Senior<br>Technical Director of CASL's Government Oversight Board), externally at CASL:<br>@casl.umd.edu; <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
