JSID's Classification Advisory Officer,
explain how they affect you. (U//FOUO)

(U//FOUO) The new NSA/CSS classification manual fPolicv Manual l-52> is in effect (as
announced late last year in EX EC mes sage-8 8 ). It makes several major changes in long-standing
classification practices. I've highlighted a couple for your attention:

(U//FOUO) In the past, NSA used the declassification marking "XI", which meant the
information was exempt from declassification for 10 years because release of the
material would "reveal an intelligence source, method, or activity, or a cryptologic system
or activity." Now NSA has chosen to mark documents with a defined "declassify
date,” namely, 25 years from the date of the classification manual ( 20291123 ). Note
that you should use this date only -- not the date 25 years from the time any new
document is createdjiei^this way —

a QSA at	with further

info.

• (U//FOUO) Furthermore, COMINT classification/declassification guides are required
for all systems, plans, programs, projects, operations, equipment, sub-compartments or
special access programs. These classification guides are to be updated by November
2005. After that time, information that isn't covered by a classification guide will be
considered UNCLASSIFIED. These new guides will replace Annex C
