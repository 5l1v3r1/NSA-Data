First, a Target of Interest communication network is in<br>the process of being upgraded, and an opportunity to gain access is discovered. To do so<br>requires NSA personnel to operate under non-official cover. Second, the Foreign Affairs<br>Directorate has established a SIGINT relationship with a new Partner. The Partner will allow an<br>in-country technical support facility if the relationship and fact that NSA personnel are operating<br>in country are concealed.<br>(C) So, how does one go about making NSA personnel look like they actually work for an entity<br>other than NSA? What regulations and policies must be followed? How does one ensure<br>cover/anonymity mechanisms don't conflict with and expose other sensitive activities? What<br>training should be provided to effectively use and maintain a cover? The simple answer to all of<br>these questions is to contact the Special Operational Support (SOS) Office, S3092.<br>(S//SI) SOS is NSA's Designated Cover Support Office (DCSO). As such, it provides<br>administration of all NSA/CSS cover and sensitive personnel support programs, which include:<br>Maintaining compliance with DoD regulations and policy, and coordinating cover plans<br>and operations with the Defense Central Cover Staff and Undersecretary of Defense for<br>Intelligence (USD(I));<br>Coordinating, as required, for the provision of cover and anonymity with logistics,<br>transportation, personnel and medical support;<br>Providing cover and anonymity guidance to mission elements that are coordinating<br>sensitive activities;<br>Working with DoD activities, Federal and State governments and non-governmental<br>organizations to establish and maintain cover support mechanisms (e.g. DoD Common<br>Access Cards (CAC), travel documents, state driver's licenses, credit cards, post office<br>boxes, social security cards, pocket litter and telecommunications);<br>Ensuring personnel are provided adequate training to support cover operations.<br>(S//SI) In short, SOS's role is to develop and maintain a cover support program which enables<br>NSA sensitive mission activities while ensuring the cover support aspects are fully coordinated<br>and compliant.<br>(S//SI) To support scenario 1 noted above, a Cover Support Plan will be developed by the SOS<br>Staff and approved by USD(I) for conducting a Cover for Action by using a Non-official Cover<br>provider. A "black" contract will be arranged and effective cover mechanisms will be put in<br>place. The second scenario is dependent on the sensitivity of the relationship with the SIGINT<br>partner. A nominal official cover arrangement may work in some cases; however for the more<br>sensitive 3rd Party relationship, the cover mechanisms will be more complex.<br>(S//SI) As NSA's missions continue to evolve and increasingly require cover operations, it is<br>imperative that we develop and maintain a cover program capable of protecting our SIGINT<br>mission from compromise, our people from the growing threat of terrorism, and the equities of<br>our partners.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
