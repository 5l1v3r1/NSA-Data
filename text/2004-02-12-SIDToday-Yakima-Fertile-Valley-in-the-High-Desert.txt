The best part about it - the kids are now grown and gone!<br>The down side - the grandchildren are on the East Coast! Still,<br>keeping in touch is only a phone call or e-mail away and traveling<br>for a visit is easier than a trip from overseas.<br>(U) We've only been in Yakima since summer and we love it here.<br>The drive across country was an education in itself. Having spent all<br>my adult years either in Maryland or overseas, it was exciting to<br>see parts of my own country for the first time. I-90 west of the<br>Mississippi travels through country that doesn't appear to have<br>changed much since the days of the Conestoga wagons and it was<br>humbling to imagine the hardships and deprivations that the early<br>settlers endured on their move west.<br>(U) The day that we arrived in Yakima the mercury hit 104Â° yet it<br>cooled off nicely when the sun went down. Everyone says that it<br>was an unusually hot summer; still, the average humidity is very<br>low (this is high desert) so the heat wasn't especially bothersome<br>compared to a Maryland summer's day. We are currently<br>experiencing our first winter in Yakima. Though there has been<br>some snow and cold, it is nowhere near the cold and precipitation<br>that Maryland has been having. And with Yakima located in the<br>foothills of the Cascades, the snow-covered mountains are a<br>spectacular sight! Many YRS families have homes with a view of Mt.<br>Adams, Mt. Rainier or both.<br>(U) Yakima itself has a population of about 70,000 and my husband<br>and I enjoy the small city atmosphere. Traffic is seldom heavy and<br>the locals consider it a traffic jam when they have to wait for a<br>stoplight to cycle twice. Each Sunday in summer and fall, there is a<br>farmer's market on a downtown street - an excellent place to get<br>just-picked local produce. The primary industry in this county is<br>agricultural.<br>(U) Though the average yearly rainfall is only 7-8 inches, irrigation<br>makes the Yakima Valley very fertile. Most of the Washington state<br>apples and cherries come from the Yakima area and, in recent<br>years, a thriving wine industry has also developed in the valley.<br>Though the shopping opportunities aren't as extensive as in<br>Maryland, we have had no problem finding what we want. For<br>bigger shopping trips or just for a change of scene, YRS'ers travel<br>to the Tri-Cities (Pasco, Richland and Kennewick), just over an<br>hour to the southeast along I-82. Portland, Oregon, is only three<br>hours away and there is no sales tax in Oregon. Seattle, home of<br>the Mariners, the Seahawks and Starbucks, is just over two hours<br>away and many go there for day trips or the weekend.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '04 <br>1.  Letter From Ottawa<br>2.  Yakima: Fertile<br>Valley in the High<br>Desert<br>3.  Life in Alice<br>4.  Omaha - The Heart<br>of the Heartland<br>5.  Life in the Big Apple<br>6.  'Dropping Anchor' in<br>Anchorage<br><br> </p>(U) One sunny weekend in October, when the leaves were<br>beautiful, my husband and I took a drive to Chinook Pass to see<br>the fall colors and the first snow of the winter. At 5,432 ft., the<br>pass is the highest pass crossing the Cascades. It generally closes<br>in early November and re-opens in late May when the snow melts.<br>Believe it or not, that day we saw very few cars on our drive and<br>only a few people were at the pass itself. Compare that to the<br>traffic on the Blue Ridge Parkway in fall!<br>(U) There is always something to do in the area. For outdoor<br>enthusiasts, there are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing,<br>hunting, skiing, snowmobiling and boating. If the arts are<br>preferred, Yakima has active local theater groups and its own<br>symphony. Numerous local venues regularly host big-name<br>performances. Yakima is the home of the Central Washington<br>State Fair in late September and the city boasts its own Continental<br>Basketball Association team, the Sun Kings, and a minor league<br>baseball team, the Yakima Bears.<br>(U) YRS'ers find getting to work in the morning to be nearly<br>stress-free. Traffic on I-82 to the Yakima Training Center, where<br>YRS is located, is usually very light. It also isn't unusual to see<br>coyotes, jackrabbits or even deer and elk along the way. It doesn't<br>surprise me that many YRS'ers say they never want to leave!<br>(U//FOUO) See the YRS PCS website for more information .<br>** Footnotes:<br>CONUS= Continental U.S.<br>PCS= Permanent Change of Station<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
