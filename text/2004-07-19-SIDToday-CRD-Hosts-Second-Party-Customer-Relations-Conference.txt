DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) CRD Hosts Second Party Customer Relations Conference<br>FROM:<br>Customer Gateway (S11) Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 07/19/2004<br><br>(TS//SI) Recently S1, the Customer Relationships Directorate, and S11, Customer Gateway,<br>hosted the first-ever Second Party Customer Relations Conference. The conference was held on<br>2-4 June, and included eleven guests from our four Second Party partners, as well as five of<br>their on-site Liaison Officers. The theme of the conference was "Customer Relations: Different<br>Perspectives, Same Goal", and the conference was the second new 2nd Party partner initiative<br>launched this year geared toward creating the Global SIGINT Community envisioned in the 2nd<br>Party Business Vision .<br>(TS//SI) Earlier this year, CRD's Customer Gateway kicked off a Second Party Information Needs<br>Exchange Working Group, which meets bi-monthly to discuss and negotiate the level of<br>Information Needs (IN) exchange needed by each partner. Based on the group's discussions, it<br>became apparent that the Second Party Community needed to move beyond simply exchanging<br>INs, and begin collaborating on a much broader range of Customer issues. Thus the idea of the<br>Second Party Conference was born, and based on its overwhelming success, look for it to be an<br>annual event.<br>(S) Mr. Charlie Meals, SID Deputy Director, opened the conference on Wednesday morning,<br>welcoming our guests and laying the groundwork for three days of information exchange,<br>networking, and future planning. Each of the eleven Second Party* guests presented briefings<br>outlining Customer Relations Management (CRM) best practices, to include successes and<br>challenges. These were followed by several NSA presentations, including a National SIGINT<br>Requirements Process (NSRP) overview, a Customer Information Needs Response (CINR)<br>update, a Customer SCORECARD briefing co-presented with GCHQ, and a Customer Feedback<br>Sharing briefing. To balance the government CRM perspective, two speakers from private<br>industry briefed the audience to provide the corporate focus.<br>(S) The second half of the conference was spent generating and prioritizing CRM initiatives of<br>highest interest, and then breaking into mixed-group sessions to generate action plans on the<br>top three initiatives. Social and networking opportunities included a reception at the National<br>Cryptologic Museum on Wednesday evening, hosted by our Second Party guests, and dinner at<br>The King's Contrivance Restaurant on Thursday evening, hosted by Mr. Gary Grantham, Principal<br>Director, Foreign Affairs Directorate.<br>(S) On Friday morning, the groups briefed the SID Leadership team on their findings and action<br>plans on three projects, to be worked jointly by 5-Eyes teams over the coming year. These<br>projects are: Information Needs Exchange, Sharing Customer Feedback, and Creating and<br>Fostering a 5-Eyes Customer Service Community to Satisfy Customer Needs. Finally, <br>, Deputy Director, Customer Relationships Directorate, closed the conference on Friday<br>afternoon.<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to our Second Party guests, a number of SID personnel also attended all,<br>or part of, the conference. These attendees became active conference participants, and<br>contributed significantly to the breakout sessions and final action briefings. The conference<br>venue was small by design, with an average daily attendance of about 40 people. This smaller,<br>working-group type of atmosphere helped organizers achieve a friendly, collaborative, and<br>interactive setting which, according to our guests, was one of the highlights of the conference.<br>Other post-conference feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and the participants unanimously<br>agreed that this inaugural Second Party Customer Relations Conference would serve as the<br>impetus for an annual event.
