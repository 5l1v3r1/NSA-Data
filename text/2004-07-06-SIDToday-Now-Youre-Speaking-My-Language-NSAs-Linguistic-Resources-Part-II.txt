Let's look at<br>these shortages a little more closely. Four-fifths of the entire<br>cryptologic language workforce is military . Currently, only<br>25% of them are at the operational standard (level 3/3) in the<br>languages they are working; only 51% of the civilians are 3/3. This<br>is the primary cause of the severe language deficiency. (This was<br>caused by a number of factors, such as the downsizing of the<br>military and civilian cadres over the last 10 years, high turnover<br>rates, etc.)<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS has drawn up a comprehensive, long-term<br>plan -- worked jointly by all cryptologic military and civilian sectors<br>-- to remedy the situation, as described below:<br>(U//FOUO) Life-cycle learning/enhancement throughout<br>career. Training must be continuous and sustained, even beyond<br>level 3.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA Action to Date: The Language Analysis<br>Professional Health Program (PHP) aims to transform<br>military and civilian linguists into language analysts through<br>a concentrated program that develops language proficiency,<br>performance skills, and congruity judgment for cryptologic<br>language work. "Congruity judgment" is the crucial ability<br>to fit an English product to the content and context of the<br>original, critical to the intelligence process. It goes far<br>beyond a superficial word-for-word, machine-like<br>substitution of English words for target-language ones.<br>(U//FOUO) The National Cryptologic School (NCS) handles<br>the job of teaching languages at NSA/CSS. NSA/CSS has<br>also sponsored the addition of Defense Language Institute<br>(DLI) "language training detachments" at NSA Fort Meade<br>and all three NSA/CSS Regional Security Operating Centers<br>(RSOCs); these teachers provide high-quality training at the<br>very sites where the language analysts are working. Finally,<br>new Accelerated Cryptologic Language Programs are in<br>place and operational at two of the three RSOCs, with the<br>third to come on-line in early FY2005. These programs<br>blend upper-level cryptologic and global language.<br>(S) NSA/CSS has programmed a total of $395 million for<br>the years FY05-09 specifically to address higher-level<br>(beyond level 2) training for military and civilian language<br>analysts throughout their careers and around the world.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Linguistic <br>1.

In a<br>study performed by the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority (SLA),<br>the number one reason for military language analysts leaving the<br>career field or service was the fact that they were not assigned to<br>language work.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA Action to Date: NSA/CSS began<br>reorganizing the management of its language cadre into a<br>single component to enable maximum flexibility and agility<br>and optimal fit of language competence to mission need.<br>Deployment Services (S214) is the first big step. It<br>manages the deployment of language analysts throughout<br>S2 , based on mission requirements and priorities.<br>(U//FOUO) Comprehensive modernization of the Defense<br>Language Institute/Foreign Language Center (DLI/FLC) in<br>Monterey, California. While there are some excellent language<br>programs in existence at universities and colleges across America,<br>DLI is responsible for language training for all military. It is the<br>model for general language training in terms of methodology and<br>approach, incorporating a learner-centered, task-based curriculum<br>from the first day of class. In this decade, over 98% of DLI's<br>training has been devoted to the basic level, the outcome of which<br>is a level 2/2. There is virtually no existing curriculum in any<br>language at DLI above Level 2/2. In order to provide training to<br>the 3/3 level (NSA/CSS's operational standard), DLI will thus have<br>to substantially increase its resident and extended programs.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Action to Date: NSA/CSS personnel<br>collaborated with DLI experts and then coordinated with the<br>US Army's Training and Doctrine Command, the Army's<br>Executive Agent for DLI, on "what it would take" for DLI to<br>offer upper level courses and curricula. Through DoD's Joint<br>Requirements Oversight Council process, NSA/CSS has<br>championed increased funding required for DLI to support<br>the 3/3 requirement. Additionally, NSA/CSS sponsored<br>three pilot Proficiency Enhancement Programs in Arabic in<br>2003. All three pilots proved conclusively that 12 additional<br>weeks of training at DLI to high aptitude, high potential,<br>level 2/2+ military language analysts resulted in at least a<br>plus point increase in proficiency, plus additional skills in<br>Iraqi.<br>(U//FOUO) Higher level language and advanced cryptologic<br>skills curriculum development. While 3/3 is the operational<br>standard, 3/3 language proficiency alone is not sufficient to handle<br>the SIGINT factors regularly encountered by the CLA. The NCS, as<br>Responsible Training Authority for intermediate and advanced<br>cryptologic language training, has for years led the Intelligence<br>Community and DoD in providing upper level work-related and jobspecific language training. NCS will work with the Language<br>Analysis Skill Community, DLI and the Services to ensure that 3/3level CLA have not only the required general language proficiency,<br>but the SIGINT language skills as well.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Actions to Date: Over the past three<br>years alone, NSA/CSS has given almost $10 million to DLI<br>for training expansion and test development. At the same<br>time, the NCS continues to increase the cryptologic focus<br>throughout its curricula in order to more effectively reflect<br>job requirements.
