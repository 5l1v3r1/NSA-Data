They emphasized the value of<br>Information Sharing; the development of governance strategies, pilot projects and concrete<br>guidelines; and commissioned analysts to step up to the plate and get the job done.<br>(U//FOUO) More hands-on analyst participation occurred in the daily break-out sessions and<br>panel discussions that addressed three main issues:<br>Ground rules for performing analysis collaboratively<br>Successful practices for doing analysis on information from multi-intelligence (multi-INT)<br>sources<br>Enablers for performing analysis collaboratively.<br>(U//FOUO) Workshop presenters, panelists, and analysts hailed from each of the Transformation<br>2.0 "petals" to include:<br>the four Regional Security Operation Centers,<br>Defense Intelligence Agency,<br>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,<br>our four Second Party partners,<br>U.S. Central Command,<br>Office of Naval Intelligence,<br>NSA Field Activities,<br>Joint Interoperability Test Command,<br>Naval Information Warfare Activity, and the<br>Joint Warfare Analysis Center.<br>(U//FOUO) This year's conference included a few new features.
