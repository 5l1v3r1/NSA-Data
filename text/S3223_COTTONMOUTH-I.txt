(TS//SI//REL) CM-I will provide air-gap bridging, software persistence capability, "in-field'* re-
programmability, and covert communications with a host software implant over the USB. The
RF link will enable command and data infiltration and exfiltration. CM-I will also communicate
with Data Network Technologies (DNT) software (STRAITBIZARRE) through a covert
channel implemented on the USB, using this communication channel to pass commands and
data between hardware and software implants. CM-I will be a GENIE-compliant implant
based on CHIMNEYPOOL.

(TS//SI//REL) CM-I conceals digital components (TRINITY), USB 1.1 FS hub, switches, and
HOWLERMONKEY (HM) RF Transceiver within the USB Series-A cable connector.
MOCCASIN is the version permanently connected to a USB keyboard. Another version can
be made with an unmodified USB connector at the other end. CM-I has the ability to
communicate to other CM devices over the RF link using an over-the-air protocol called
SPECULATION.	cottonmouth conop
