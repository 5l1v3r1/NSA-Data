DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Generally Speaking: Iraq -- Worth All The Effort!<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 02/02/2005<br><br>Thoughts on the situation in Iraq (U)<br>(U//FOUO) Many times in our work, we can toil away at a huge pile of data or issues and not see<br>the fruits of our labors for weeks, months, or years. We then become frustrated and begin to ask<br>-- "Is this really worth it? Are we doing the right thing here?" Then suddenly, there will be a<br>breakthough and the results are so important and positive that we wonder how we could have<br>ever doubted that we were doing the right thing.<br>(S//SI) For nearly three years, the U.S. SIGINT System (USSS) has been working at a tough<br>problem -- supporting our war efforts in Iraq. We are bombarded with negative news coverage<br>that paints a "can't win" story, and I imagine that at some point many of us had a moment<br>where we asked -- "Is this really worth it?" Yes, the U.S. SIGINT system has had successes in<br>the war effort, but at some point amid all the difficulties in Iraq, and all the negative reporting, it<br>is only natural to wonder if these successes might be futile.<br>(U//FOUO) For me, watching the Iraqi election coverage on TV Sunday afternoon reaffirmed that<br>we are doing the right thing in Iraq. It was a very emotional day for me personally as I<br>witnessed Iraqi citizens celebrating democracy. I think they proved that exercising democratic<br>freedom and being an active participant in the direction of government is part of human nature.<br>It was a great day for Iraq, and a great day for the United States as well. I believe it clearly<br>demonstrates that what we are doing in Iraq is very important, and absolutely necessary.<br>(U//FOUO) Thanks to all of you who have worked so hard over the last several months to help<br>ensure this successful turn of events in Iraq. And no matter where you work in the USSS, thanks<br>for all you do to serve our nation and protect its democratic ideals.<br>(U//FOUO) We obviously still have a long way to go in Iraq, and many more hurdles to<br>overcome. However, as evidenced by the events in Iraq on Sunday, we have accomplished a<br>great deal. For a moment, we can take off our rucksack, and know that we can and will make it<br>to the finish line -- and fully understand that our efforts are truly meaningful and definitely<br>"worth it."<br> <br> <br>(U) Woman votes in Basra (Reuters) (U) Voting in Najaf (Reuters)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
