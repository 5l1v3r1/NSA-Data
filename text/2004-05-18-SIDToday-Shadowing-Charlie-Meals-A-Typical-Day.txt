My motivation for applying for this program is probably a little different<br>than most participants. I'm a member of NSA's Extended Enterprise in Hawaii and a junior<br>Intelligence Analyst who has never worked at Ft. Meade. One way I've found to stay connected<br>with NSAW and the SID Leadership is to take full advantage of SID today and other SID<br>Communication initiatives. When I was planning a TDY to Maryland for another purpose, I<br>thought the shadowing program would be a perfect opportunity to be introduced to the big<br>picture back at Headquarters. Needless to say, I was not disappointed and this day was truly the<br>highlight of my trip.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Meals' day of meetings began well before I arrived and continued well after I<br>departed. His Executive Assistant prepared me for his schedule the day before and explained<br>that this was not a "typical day" for Charlie. What this statement meant was that most of the<br>day's schedule consisted of a SID leadership offsite and there would not be the usual number of<br>office calls and meetings scattered throughout the building - and that he might actually take a<br>lunch break, which is a rarity! Although the offsite dominated the majority of the schedule, I<br>believe I had an accurate glimpse into the scope of Mr. Meals' role and responsibilities.<br>(TS//SI) What struck me as most significant was how his day encompassed NSA's past, present,<br>and future. During the Leadership offsite, Mr. Meals stepped away to present a Meritorious<br>Civilian Award to a member of the workforce who had made significant contributions to the SID<br>mission. Current issues were continually being dealt with, such as SIGINT support to<br>SOUTHCOM due to heightened tensions in Haiti. This was my first exposure to an Issues<br>Management Team in action. All these things were dealt with as Mr. Meals and the SID teams<br>were participating in their offsite with Information Technology Infrastructure Services and then<br>the Foreign Affairs Directorate to coordinate resources for FY06.<br>(U//FOUO) If I described everything that Mr. Meals did to make this a worthwhile experience,<br>this article would never end. He was personally involved in ensuring that my day spent<br>shadowing him was interesting and productive. He explained early in the day that for me to<br>absorb all the information that I would encounter, it would be good for me to take notes, and he<br>would then discuss anything that I needed further clarification on during our one-on-one time.<br>My list of unfamiliar concepts grew throughout the day, but Mr. Meals took the time from his<br>busy schedule to discuss anything that was on my mind, even down to explaining mundane<br>acronyms and HQ jargon (there was a LOT!).<br>(U//FOUO) Because Mr. Meals and his staff seemed concerned that I was not experiencing a<br>"typical day", they had a copy of his calendar from the previous week to review with me so that<br>I would have a better picture of his schedule. Another thing that impressed me about Mr. Meals<br>was the depth and breadth of the knowledge that he brings to the SID leadership team. His<br>previous assignment as Chief of NSA/CSS Pacific gave him incredible insight into the issues<br>facing the Pacific AOR (Area of Responsibility), the AOR of this century. Both MG Quirk and Mr.<br>Meals bring unique perspectives and backgrounds to their jobs. The endless energy and<br>enthusiasm that seemed to pour out of these two was contagious.<br>(U//FOUO) As mentioned earlier, my main purpose for shadowing Charlie Meals was to<br>familiarize myself with the SIGINT Directorate's operations at NSAW and to compare it my<br>experiences here in Hawaii. The day certainly contributed in a positive way to my first<br>impressions of Headquarters. I am pleased to say that I was faced with many more similarities<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">then differences and that the field and Headquarters actually resembled each other on many<br>levels. This experience was unforgettable and has made me proud to be part of the SID<br>workforce, even though it may not have been a "typical day".<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
