H CANYONDUST is a ground based INMARSAT mobile terminal
geolocation system that computes geo-locations on all INMARSAT
M, mini-M, M4, B, and C terminals, within its coverage region. The
geo-locations are performed on the registration, access request,
response bursts, or SCPC. The coverage region is defined as an area
that is serviced by at least two INMARSAT satellites.
