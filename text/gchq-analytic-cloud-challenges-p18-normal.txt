Known Target, Known
Query

Streaming. Rumour Mill and QFD capabilities (possibly assisted by cloud analytic)
Could select data subset based on target, could pre-calculate results
Large usage and automation suggests need for optimised capability

Known Target, Unknown
Query

Not possible with existing QFD capabilities

Needs new analytic or more Indexes on target selected data

Large usage and needs suggest a new capability

Core QFD capability, possibly populated by cloud analytic
1 Full unselected data set required but what level of Interactive query?
1 Is It acceptable that older data be made available non-lnteractively?

Unknown

Target, Unknown Query

1 Use batch analytic platform for low level search or new analytic
Could a heavily indexed store provide a responsive capability?
