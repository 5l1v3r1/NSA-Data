NSA’s outstanding tactical support could not have had such significant impact without
the herculean efforts of NSA’s Representative to USUN, who delivered SIGINT product and pre-
publication tippers, often just in time for consultations, and provided feedback to NSA analysts to
further guide production and prioritization.

NSA analysts and linguists worked extra hours

(including weekends), collaborating and sharing information freely among the Product Lines to
ensure that USUN received the most accurate information in time to make a difference.
