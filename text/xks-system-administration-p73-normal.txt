• The automatic starProc process is as follows:

►	Hour 1: master asks whoever (say xks-control) for an
update, gets the rpm, installs It, there Is much rejoicing.
The slaves asks the master for the rpm at the same time
the master asks xks-control, but obviously the master
doesn’t have it, so nothing happens.

►	Hour 2: everyone asks for an update again, this time the
master has the rpm, the slaves download it and install
and there is much rejoicing.

►	The rpm is installed and process_data_parent’s are
restarted as soon as the rpm is downloaded on a given
machine.
