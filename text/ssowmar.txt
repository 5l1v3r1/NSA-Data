(U//FOUO) OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHT

WHARPDRIVE

(TS//SI//NF) SSO was informed on 12 March 2013 that the access
point for WHARPDRIVE was discovered by commercial
consortium personnel. Witting partner personnel have removed
the evidence and a plausible cover story was provided. All
collection has ceased.

(TS//SI//NF) SSO was planning to conduct a week of training in
April and support a deployment in June, however, the partner
has requested to delay both training and shipping.
