Communication vs DNI Content

&

If an analyst tasks a Boolean equation “bomb”
and “chemical” they likely want to see all
communication that mentions ‘bomb’ and
‘chemical’ and not all web pages, news stories,
blog posts etc. where those two words appear
What we need is a context-aware scanning
engine that knows where it is inside of the raw
DNI in order to properly apply analyst tasking
