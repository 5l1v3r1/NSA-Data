(S//SI//REL) US, Japan Now Exchanging Collection from Reconnaissance Missions
FROM: Airborne Collection Management (S33141)

Run Date: 03/14/2007

(S//SI//REL) For over a year, offices throughout NSA* have been working on an effort to allow the U.S.
and Japan to exchange SIGINT from their airborne reconnaissance missions in East Asia -- and the effort
has now paid off. The U.S. is now releasing its reconnaissance PREMS (Preliminary Mission Summary
Reports) to Japan's Directorate for SIGINT (DFS), and the Japanese are reciprocating.

(S//SI//REL) This intelligence exchange was based on an action from the 2005 U.S.-Japan Joint Service
Bilateral ELINT/PROFORMA Conference, and came to encompass all forms of SIGINT, not solely
ELINT. U.S. PREMS approved for release include those from the RC-135 and EP-3 missions' collection
that fall within the parameters of the NSA-Japan SIGINT exchange. In return, the U.S. is receiving
PREMS from Japan's YS-11 and EP-3 missions.

(S//SI//REL) In working to make this exchange a reality, NSA's Country Desk Officer for Japan, SUSLAJ
representatives, and NSA's Airborne Collection Management Office reviewed a random sampling of U.S.
PREMS to evaluate the target information that could be shared, what would need to be purged, and
determine the amount of effort involved in releasing the information. It was determined that target activity
(i.e. the collected military communications) and collection totals will be retained in the releasable
versions, and the information regarding the actual mission specifics and crew would be deleted. SUSLAJ
has committed resources towards the release and sanitization of the U.S. PREMS reports.

(S//SI//REL) As a result of the efforts of everyone involved in this process, on 9 February 2007 the first
Japanese YS-11 PREMS was received, translated and published via a formal message by SUSLAJ. In
turn, the first PREMS from the RC-135 were released to the DFS by SUSLAJ on 15 February 2007 for
two missions flown in the East China Sea, both of which solicited reactions by PRC fighters. The PREMS
from all four-mission areas -- the East China Sea, the South China Sea, Overland Korea, and the Sea of
Japan -- are now shareable between both sides, allowing DFS access to the Chinese, North Korean, and
Russian military collection acquired by Japan-based, US Airborne SIGINT collectors.

(S//SI//REL) This was a huge effort set forth by all involved, and an even bigger success story. Once a
U.S. EP-3 deploys to the area, its PREMS will also be shared with DFS.
