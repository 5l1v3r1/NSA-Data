Target Areas/Taskinq (362s):

Argentina

TSI initiated and supported OH tasking against Argentina in efforts to collect high priority
military and Leadership comms. Work was coordinated across the OH enterprise to obtain
results when opportunity arose using US 903G and US 940C, MHS Ops were a main driver
for this collection. Results included a number of TETRA collects and at least seven
Argentinian PCM (digital) microwave emitters which were processed and geolocated.
Although TSI haven’t got desired results on their comms of interest as yet, this was a positive
and encouraging team effort against this target in readiness for when next opportunity arises.
Efforts between TSI and MHS continue.
