t

I

(TS//SI/REL) This technique supports any desktop PC system that contains at least
one PCI connector (for BULLDOZER installation) and Microsoft Windows 9x, 2000,
2003, XP, or Vista.

(TS//SI//REL) Through interdiction, BULLDOZER is installed in the target system as
a PCI bus hardware implant. After fielding, if KONGUR is removed from the system
as a result of an operating system upgrade or reinstall, GINSU can be set to trigger
on the next reboot of the system to restore the software implant.
