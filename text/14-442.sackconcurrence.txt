SACK, Circuit Judge, concurring:

I	fully concur in Judge Lynch’s opinion for the Court. I nonetheless take
the liberty of offering several additional observations about the import of today’s
decision.

Because our decision is based on our reading of a federal statute, not the
Constitution, Congress can in effect overrule it. The enactment of a statute
amending or supplanting the portion of section 215 that, until now, has been
interpreted to authorize the NSA’s bulk collection program would likely do the
job, subject, of course, to a subsequent constitutional challenge in the courts.

Alternatively, Congress might simply terminate the program. Recent news
dispatches indicate that it is considering doing just that.1 And the plaintiffs have
suggested that their grievance could be addressed by a statutory amendment 1

replacing the bulk collection program with an arrangement under which the
telephone companies will retain the metadata in question, subject to valid
government subpoenas. See Argument Tr. at 7-8 (Sept. 2, 2014) (statement by
counsel for the appellant); Jonathan Weisman & Jennifer Steinhauer, Patriot Act
Faces Curbs Supported by Both Parties, N.Y. Times, May 1, 2015, at A1 (reporting
that, under "bipartisan bills in the House and Senate, the Patriot Act would be
changed to prohibit bulk collection . . . . The data would instead be stored by the
phone companies themselves, and could be accessed by intelligence agencies
only after approval of the" Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court).

In any event, as Judge Lynch’s opinion makes clear, it is Congress’s
prerogative, not ours, to resolve the conflict underlying these issues in the first
instance. Ante at 7, 90.

In that connection, Judge Lynch’s opinion refers to "the primary role that
should be played by [Congress] in deciding, explicitly and after full debate,
whether such programs [as those pursuant to which the NSA has collected
telephone metadata] are appropriate and necessary." Ante at 92. I agree. I think
it nonetheless appropriate to pause to ensure that that statement is not read to
devalue or minimize the role of the courts in determining the meaning of any

Case 14-42, Document 169, 05/07/2015, 1503603, Page3 of 13

such legislation, its future application to particular acts or practices of the federal
government and others, or its propriety under the Constitution. The courts are
charged with the responsibility of making those judgments. They are, as an
institution, tasked with the duty, in the context of cases or controversies properly
brought before them, to seek to reconcile the never completely reconcilable
tension between the individual’s interest in privacy and right to civil liberties and
the government’s duty to protect American lives and property.2

The role of Congress under Article I of the Constitution and that of the
courts under Article III, "in the face of the concerns about the reasonableness of
the [] assertions [by the Executive Branch under Article II] of the necessity of the
data collection," ante at 90, are, moreover, not entirely independent from one
another. Congress has for more than thirty-five years looked to the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court (the "FISC"), first established for such matters
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ("FISA"), to adjudicate
cases and controversies arising out of the application and administration of the
Act. See ante at 6.

2	The writer has expressed general views on the subject elsewhere. See Robert D. Sack,
Speech: Judicial Skepticism and the Threat of Terrorism, 31 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 1 (2009)
(adapted from Law Day speech before the Federal Bar Council, New York City, May 1,

Case 14-42, Document 169, 05/07/2015, 1503603, Page4 of 13

The FISC, like the quotidian federal district courts and courts of appeals, is
established under Article III of the Constitution.3 But because of its specialized
role dealing with matters touching on national security concerns, it conducts its
proceedings differently. Two of the fundamental characteristics of ordinary
Article III courts that are often considered central to their mission are
transparency ("openness") and a properly functioning adversary system. Neither
transparency nor a true adversary system characterizes the operation of the FISC.

Thus, most Article III courts, including this Court, operate under a strong
presumption that their papers and proceedings are open to the public. See, e.g.,
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 571-72 (1980).

The value of openness lies in the fact that people . . . can have confidence
that standards of fairness are being observed; the sure knowledge that
anyone is free to attend gives assurance that established procedures are
being followed and that deviations will become known. Openness thus
enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of
fairness so essential to public confidence in the system.

Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., 464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (emphasis
omitted). "People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their

such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." U.S.
Const., Art. III, § 1.

institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from
observing." Richmond Newspapers, Inc., 448 U.S. at 572.4

The FISC, by contrast, operates largely behind closed doors. While it may
do so at the cost of some public confidence, the court’s ability to do otherwise
would appear to be, at best, limited. Information cannot simultaneously be kept
secret and made public at the same time - at least not this side of quantum
physics.5

This conundrum is not unique to the FISC - it confronts any Article III
court addressing what purports to constitute state secrets or other information
the confidentiality of which is protectable by law. See, e.g., United States v.

Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953) (setting forth the method for judicial consideration of

4	The Supreme Court’s case law has been developed largely in the context of criminal
cases. It likely also applies to civil proceedings. See, e.g., Hartford Courant Co. v.
Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir. 2004) (applying principles of First Amendment rights
of access to federal courts to conclude that there is a "qualified First Amendment right
to inspect [civil] docket sheets, which provide an index to the records of judicial
proceedings"); Marc A. Franklin, et al., Mass Media Law: Cases and Materials 596 (8th ed.
2011) ("The Supreme Court has not decided whether there is a constitutional right of
access to civil trials, but lower courts have assumed that the First Amendment right to
attend civil trials is at least as strong as the right to attend criminal trials." (citing, inter
alia, Westmoreland v. CBS, 752 F.2d 16, 23 (2d Cir. 1984); Publicker Industries, Inc. v. Cohen,
733 F.2d 1059 (3d Cir. 1984))).

5	To be sure, there may be aspects of FISC operations that simply do not warrant secret
treatment. Cf. Weisman & Steinhauer, supra (reporting that proposed congressional
legislation would require the declassification of all significant FISA court opinions). I
doubt, though, that in light of the likely scope of these exceptions, they materially affect
my overall observations about in camera FISC proceedings.

civil cases touching on state secrets); United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 125-32
(2d Cir. 2009) (describing at length the methods employed when a criminal
defendant in federal district court seeks FISA documents); Doe v. CIA, 576 F.3d 95
(2d Cir. 2009) (civil) (describing this Court’s manner of conducting an appeal
involving state secrets). In such cases, courts typically operate publicly only to
the extent they think practicable after evaluating the basis of the government’s
purported need for secrecy and the effects of such secrecy on the other parties
before them.

The absence of a robust adversary system in the FISC may be another
matter. It requires little beyond the common experience of bench and bar to
establish the general importance to courts and the parties before them of hearing
from all sides of a dispute. The Supreme Court has recognized that:

Adversary proceedings are a major aspect of our system of criminal justice.
Their superiority as a means for attaining justice in a given case is nowhere
more evident than in those cases, such as the ones at bar, where an issue
must be decided on the basis of a large volume of factual materials, and
after consideration of the many and subtle interrelationships which may
exist among the facts reflected by these records. As the need for adversary
inquiry is increased by the complexity of the issues presented for
adjudication, and by the consequent inadequacy of ex parte procedures as
a means for their accurate resolution, the displacement of well-informed
advocacy necessarily becomes less justifiable.

Considering the issue of advocacy in the context of deliberations involving
alleged state secrets, and, more broadly, the "leak"6 by Edward Snowden that led
to this litigation,7 calls to mind the disclosures by Daniel Ellsberg that gave rise to
the legendary "Pentagon Papers" litigation.8 The district court and court of
appeals stages of the Pentagon Papers case unfolded in this courthouse some
forty-four years ago. United States v. New York Times Co. (the "Pentagon Papers"
case), 328 F. Supp. 324, 333 (S.D.N.Y.) (Gurfein, J.), remanded, 444 F.2d 544 (2d

6	I use quotation marks around the term "leak" for reasons adverted to in New York
Times Co. v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 160 (2d Cir. 2006) (Sack, J., dissenting):

[T]he use of the term "leak" to identify unauthorized disclosures in this context
may be unhelpful. It misleadingly suggests a system that is broken. Some
unauthorized disclosures may be harmful indeed. But others likely contribute to
the general welfare . . . . Secretive bureaucratic agencies, like hermetically sealed
houses, often benefit from a breath of fresh air.

Id. at 183 (Sack, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted).

7	The complaint was filed about one week after and based on the disclosure. See ACLU
v. Clapper, No. 11-cv-7562, DI 1 (Complaint). Although the "leak" led to this litigation,
our decision is not about the Snowden disclosures themselves nor should the
significance of our rather complex analysis of the statute be confused with the
significance vel non of the security breach or the NSA telephone metadata program.

8	A "Lexis" search conducted by the writer on April 29, 2015 disclosed more than 40
articles comparing the two sets of unauthorized disclosures in "Major Newspapers,"
including The Los Angeles Times, The Hartford Courant, The Globe and Mail (Canada), The
Boston Globe, The San Francisco Chronicle and The Seattle Times. A further such "Lexis"
search of The New York Times also found multiple examples. See also, Jonathan
Capehart, Snowden Is No Daniel Ellsberg, Wash. Post, July 2, 2013, at A15 ("I pleaded last
month for an end to the breathless comparisons between Edward Snowden and Daniel
Ellsberg.").

Cir.) (en banc) (per curiam), rev'd, 403 U.S. 713 (1971) (per curiam). The issues in
that case, like the concerns that led to the deliberations of the Church Committee,
and then to FISA’s enactment and the creation of the FISC, arose, as Judge Lynch
puts it, during "the early 1970s, in a climate not altogether unlike today’s." Ante
at 5. His observation is reminiscent of Judge Gurfein’s somber contemporary
dictum about the same era: "These are troubled times." Pentagon Papers, 328 F.
Supp. at 331.

The disclosures, the national security issues, and the challenges facing the
Pentagon Papers district court and the FISC are different. There is, however, at
least one aspect of the Pentagon Papers cases that may be instructive here.

The FISC’s hearings are, as noted, held ex parte. The targets of their
proceedings are ordinarily not represented by counsel. (Indeed it seems likely
that targets are usually unaware of the existence of the proceedings or their
subject.) In the Pentagon Papers case, the court held a hearing, part in public and
part in camera, to determine the facts of the case and the whether further
publication of the papers would endanger legitimate national security interests.
In both the open and closed portions of the hearing, The New York Times enjoyed
the assistance of highly competent counsel. The Times and its counsel already

8

Case 14-42, Document 169, 05/07/2015, 1503603, Page9 of 13

had access to the material that the government was attempting to keep from
further public view; barring their presence in the otherwise closed hearing room
would not have advanced the legitimate security interests of the United States.
Their attendance at the hearing apparently turned out to be pivotal.

During the public portion of the hearing, there was little indication that
Judge Gurfein was sympathetic to the Times' position that further publication of
the Papers, which were marked classified, was constitutionally protected or
otherwise permissible. See David Rudenstine, The Day the Presses Stopped: A
History of the Pentagon Papers Case 107-52 (1996). As the public portion of the
hearing closed, "the government had reason to be confident that it would prevail,
and the Times lawyers could take very little comfort from what had so far
occurred." Id. at 152.

It was only upon the Times' cross-examination of the first witness in the
subsequent closed-door hearing, in which the Times' counsel focused relentlessly
on what, specifically, in the Papers would present a threat to the United States if
disclosed and why, that Judge Gurfein’s apparent leaning began to shift towards
the position of the Times. Id.; see also James C. Goodale, Fighting for the Press: The
Inside Story of the Pentagon Papers and Other Battles 105-07 (2013) (describing the

9

Case 14-42, Document 169, 05/07/2015, 1503603, Page10 of 13

participation of counsel for the Times at the closed-door hearing). The Judge’s
own questioning of the witnesses9 evinced his emerging acceptance of the Times'
position and his embrace of the nature of the government’s burden. Only after
hearing extensive argument, examination, and cross-examination, from both
sides, did Judge Gurfein conclude: "I am constrained to find as a fact that the in
camera proceedings at which representatives of the Department of State,
Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified, did not convince
this Court that the publication of these historical documents would seriously
breach the national security." Pentagon Papers, 328 F. Supp. at 330. By common,
if not universal, consensus, the district court’s conclusion that the publication of
the Papers by the Times would not "involve a serious security danger," informed

9	By happy coincidence, also contributing to the ability of the district court effectively
to address the issue of the national security implications of further publication was the
fact that Judge Gurfein had spent four years in World War II and after as an officer,
rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the O.S.S. (Office of Strategic Services). See

http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=930&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na (last

Agency. See History of the CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, https://www.cia.gov/about-
cia/history-of-the-cia/index.html (last visited April 30, 2015); see also Goodale, supra at
101 (describing Judge Gurfein's use of his intelligence background during the hearing).

Notably, the possibility of giving the FISC improved access to relevant expertise
is reflected in currently proposed legislation. See Weisman & Steinhauer, supra ("The
legislation would . . . create a panel of experts to advise the FISA court on privacy, civil
liberties, and technology matters . . . .").

Case 14-42, Document 169, 05/07/2015, 1503603, Pagell of 13

as it was by the participation of legal representatives of all parties, was right.10 11

It may be worth considering that the participation of an adversary to the
government at some point in the FISC’s proceedings could similarly provide a
significant benefit to that court. The FISC otherwise may be subject to the
understandable suspicion that, hearing only from the government, it is likely to
be strongly inclined to rule for the government. And at least in some cases it
may be that its decision-making would be improved by the presence of counsel
opposing the government’s assertions before the court. Members of each branch
of government have encouraged some such development.11

10	See Rudenstine, supra, at 326-29. Some years later, Erwin Griswold, who, as the
United States Solicitor General, argued the case in the Supreme Court, conceded as
much. He wrote, "I have never seen any trace of a threat to the national security from
the publication [of the Papers]. Indeed, I have never seen it even suggested that there
was such an actual threat." Erwin N. Griswold, Secrets Not Worth Keeping: The Courts
and Classified Information, Wash. Post, Feb. 15, 1989, at A25. He further observed: "It
quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with
classified material that there is massive overclassification and that the principal concern
of the classifiers is not with national security, but rather with governmental
embarrassment of one sort or another." Id.

Having said all that, I reiterate that we do not assert any institutional
capability to provide, recommend, or in the absence of a case or controversy,
pass on the propriety of FISC’s deliberations. As Judge Lynch's opinion makes
clear, it is Congress that must decide in the first instance under what
circumstance the government can obtain data touching upon conflicting national
security and personal privacy interests.

Recognition of the dangers to the fundamental rights of citizens that
inevitably arise when the nation attempts effectively to treat grave external
threats to lives and property was not dependent on the creation of telephone
metadata or the preparation of secret reports on the origin of the Vietnam War.

It is as old as the Republic.

Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national
conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its
dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the
continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will
compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and
security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and
