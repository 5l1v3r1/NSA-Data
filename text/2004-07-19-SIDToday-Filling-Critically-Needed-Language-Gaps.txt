Aspatore <br>Language Enhancement Program Manager (S2) <br>(U//FOUO) Please note that although the connection of the<br> facility with NSA and its employees is U//FOUO, it is<br>highly sensitive information. All are asked to assist in keeping this<br>a low-profile facility with no overt connection to NSA.<br>(U//FOUO) What's one way NSA is "building the bench" of<br>tomorrow's cryptologic language analysts? - via the Language<br>Enhancement Program (LEP), launched in January 04 by the<br>National Cryptologic School (NCS), the Senior Language Authority<br>(SLA), and Human Resources (HR). The LEP is an intensive global<br>language training program which takes new hires with level 2/2<br>skills in commonly taught languages (such as French) and crosstrains them to a level 3/3 into a critically needed, less-commonlytaught language (like Arabic.) It is loosely modeled on the<br>successful Russian 15A program of the 1980s.<br>(U//FOUO) The LEP also enables personnel who already have some<br>knowledge of a critically needed language to enhance their skills to<br>a level 3/3 . Participants will be required to meet specified level 2<br>and level 3 milestones. Depending on the language and the skill<br>level of the participant, the program could take up to three years<br>to complete.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Linguistic <br>1.

Filling 'Critically<br>Needed Language'<br>Gaps<br><br>(U//FOUO) The NCS and SID are co-sponsoring the refit of three<br>floors of<br> to house both this effort and other<br>training programs related to the DIRNSA-required 3/3 language<br>level . This totally unclassified facility will house two state-of-theart language learning laboratories, as well as a 21st century<br>multimedia language resource center. All classrooms will be fitted<br>with smart boards and lap top computers.<br>(U//FOUO) The NCS is staffing the effort with teachers from the<br>Defense Language Institute and from the local area. The overall<br>goal of the FY05 program is 60 LEP participants, with at least an<br>additional 60 students every year thereafter. Classes in early<br>October will begin cross-training participants into Arabic, Chinese,<br>and Persian. There will also be enhancement classes in these<br>languages. The LEP will eventually train participants in Korean,<br>Turkish, Dari, Urdu, and Pashto as well. To meet the FY05 goal, the<br>SLA, the NCS, HR, and Security launched an intensive recruiting<br>and hiring effort in February 2004.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
