DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) What Does the Future Hold? SINIO Forecast for 20062010<br>FROM: Marilyn J. Maines<br>Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)<br>Run Date: 01/08/2004<br>FROM: Marilyn J. Maines <br>Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17) <br>(S) As part of NSA's continuing focus on strategic planning, the SIGINT National Intelligence<br>Officers (SINIO) Council recently produced an assessment on the most critical intelligence issues<br>most likely to be facing the nation and the SIGINT system during the 2006-2010 time period.<br>This effort was undertaken to support the Director's Strategic Planning Off-Site in early<br>December 2003 as well as an upcoming SID strategic planning activity in mid-January 2004.<br>(U) What will the World Look Like at the End of the First Decade of this Century?<br>(S) The memorandum forecasts the likely state of the world over the latter half of this decade<br>and the resulting intelligence issues that will drive intelligence needs in support of US national<br>defense, homeland security, and foreign and economic policy over that period. It assesses that<br>the world scene over the years 2006-2010 will continue to be shaped by the threats posed by<br>international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and regional instabilities,<br>particularly where a convergence of these matters arises. Such a world will be distinguished by<br>challenges to US economic and foreign policy goals from:<br>1.  the expanding EU and rising states like China,<br>2.  unstable governments in grave jeopardy due to growing economic and social ills; and<br>3.  regional tensions or conflict growing out of ethnic and religious differences and<br>competition for access to strategic resources, most notably energy or water.<br>(U) From What Directions Will the Primary Challenges Come?<br>(S) It is our judgment that such a world is likely to see terrorists conduct a chemical, biological,<br>radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack on the United States or its overseas interests, more<br>involvement of criminal elements in enabling terrorists to penetrate US borders, and continued,<br>but highly cloaked efforts by potential adversary states to acquire WMD capabilities for their<br>perceived deterrence qualities. At the same time, these same states and, in some cases,<br>terrorists will continue their efforts to realize a capability to counter US military superiorityeither through the development or acquisition of an advanced weapons system, to include<br>offensive information operations capabilities, or through the development of asymmetric<br>strategies for the employment of existing strike capabilities.<br>(U//FOUO) Critical Issues and Regions for 2010 - Implications for SIGINT<br>(S//SI) Six of the most critical areas of concern examined in the SINIO Forecast are distinct<br>defense and security issues :<br>1.  Counterterrorism<br>2.  Counternarcotics and Organized Crime<br>3.  Combating Proliferation<br>4.  Weapons and Space<br>5.  Information Operations; and<br>6.  Counterintelligence.<br>Another six focus on global geopolitical or regional matters :<br>1.  Global Geopolitical Issues<br>2.  Africa (Sub-Saharan)<br>3.  Asia-Pacific<br><br> </p>4.  Europe/Russia/Eurasia<br>5.  Latin America; and<br>6.  Middle East/North Africa/Central and South Asia.<br>This structure was selected to correlate with the Issue Management Team construct and to<br>directly support issue management in the SIGINT Enterprise. As the SINIOs and Issue<br>Management Teams work to identify gaps and prioritize sub-targets both within each issue set<br>and across the sets, there will be many future opportunities for NSA senior leadership to use this<br>data as input for determining the best alignment of SIGINT resources against these challenges.<br>(S) A powerpoint briefing on the key judgments of the forecast is available HERE .<br>(U//FOUO) The SINIOs reside in the Strategic Intelligence Issues office within SID's Customer<br>Relationships Directorate.
