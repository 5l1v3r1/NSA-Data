Operational Data Mining - Key message

•	A combination of technical data mining experts, SIGINT
developers, Operations analysts, appropriate data access
and suitable IT is needed to make target discovery happen

•	In our experience to date, it’s not about tool development
but the development of new (and fragile) data mining
techniques by a critical mass of suitably skilled people!

•	There are a set of cloud analytics that should form part of
a toolbox but even then their successful application is
likely to be as a result of collaboration with analysts
