SIGINT for the Department of Agriculture<br>FROM: <br> and <br>Washington Liaison Office (WLO) (S112)<br>Run Date: 11/01/2004<br><br>SIGINT supports negotiations, helps keep food supply safe (S)<br>(S) You may not think that the Department of Agriculture would have much interaction with SID,<br>but in fact SIGINT is a huge contributor to Agriculture's mission.<br>(TS//SI) The USDA is involved in trade operations to protect and secure a large segment of the<br>U.S economy. The Secretary of Agriculture, the Deputy, the Undersecretaries, and other subcabinet members who are briefed by the WLO Rep on a weekly basis often rely on SIGINT to<br>support their negotiations, and not just to address U.S farming issues, but international trade<br>issues as well. The leadership team at Agriculture makes routine negotiation decisions and<br>recommendations to their "chain of command" based on SIGINT.<br>(TS//SI) As you can imagine, not many people within USDA are TS/SCI cleared. However, with<br>our tear-line reporting and write-to-release we can still support USDA leaders. Most recently<br>WLO Rep <br> briefed the Secretary of Agriculture on key trade issues. Several<br>reports dealt with trade matters that a Deputy Undersecretary was currently negotiating. Having<br>previously checked with USDA security on the Deputy Undersecretary's clearances, the liaison<br>officer knew that he was not cleared for SIGINT.<br>(TS//SI) The Secretary became very concerned that the Deputy Undersecretary would not have<br>access to the information, which she considered critical to a successful meeting. One of the<br>Undersecretaries at the briefing jumped in and stated that, "NSA does a very clever thing, they<br>report at the 'secret' level too," and pointed out that the Deputy Undersecretary had already<br>seen the reporting. The Secretary was very relieved, turned to the NSA Rep, and stated, "That is<br>very helpful that you (NSA) do that."<br>(S//SI) NSA has a substantial and proven record in protecting US trade interests and keeping<br>the US food supply safe by providing relevant information to Agriculture. The WLO has<br>established a unique rapport with sub-cabinet members at Agriculture. This relationship allows<br>WLO representatives to attend weekly USDA briefings to ensure NSA is aware of trade issues<br>and upcoming meetings. Additionally, the WLO has access to the Secretary's and other USDA<br>leadership members' calendars to help stay on top of hot issues. The WLO communicates this<br>information to the TOPI's, whose response is nothing short of spectacular.<br>(TS//SI) Our Canadian partners, as well, deserve credit for their role in the WLO's support to<br>Agriculture. While searching through MAUI*, the WLO often finds CSE reporting on topics of<br>interest to USDA leaders. Through special arrangements with our Canadian partners, USDA now<br>regularly receives this vital and much valued reporting.<br>(U) While the WLO is simply a conduit of support to Agriculture, the real performers are the<br>TOPIs and our Canadian partners! When things are in full surge mode and information is flowing<br>back and forth, the only word to describe the energy level in the small WLO office is "awesome"!<br>(U) Notes: <br>* MAUI = Multimedia Access User Interface (it is used for retrieving text and multimedia<br>intelligence reports) <br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
