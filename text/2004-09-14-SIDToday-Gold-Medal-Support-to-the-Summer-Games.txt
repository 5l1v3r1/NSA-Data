The Olympic venues were located<br>throughout Greece, including Athens, Crete, Volos, Patra, Olympia, and Thessaloniki. Such an<br>important international event with a worldwide audience wrapped to their television and PCs for<br>two weeks presented a very tempting target for terrorists.<br> <br>Athens as seen from the Acropolis <br>(S//SI) Well before the start of the Summer Games, NSA began supporting Intelligence<br>Community efforts to:<br>provide Force Protection/Indication and Warning of imminent, indigenous and<br>transnational threats to U.S. interests in the Olympic area of responsibility (AOR);<br>develop an awareness of the Greek Government's knowledge of threats to the Games<br>and or U.S. interests;<br>understand how countries bordering Greece were prepared to respond to a potential<br>attack; and,<br>support the U.S. Military in any operation to provide assistance to the Greek Government<br>and/or evacuate U.S. entities from the area.<br>(S//SI) To accomplish this herculean task, NSA personnel, at the heart of the action in Athens,<br>were working very closely with the State Department, which was responsible for providing<br>security for U.S. Olympic officials, judges and athletes -- at the sporting events, the Olympic<br>Village and aboard cruise ships in Piraeus Harbor serving as floating hotels. From the Olympic<br>AOR, around the world and back to the Fort, NSA personnel were manning 24-hour watches and<br>operations while working with Home Land Security, the FBI, NGA, CIA and DIA, as well as<br>EUCOM and SOCOM in support of NATO. NSA support to the 2004 Summer Games encompassed<br>a wide range of offices to include:<br>the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD),<br>Installations and Logistics (I&amp;L),<br>Information Technology Infrastructure Services (ITIS),<br>Counterterrorism (CT),<br>International Security Issues (ISI),<br>Customer Relationships (S1),<br>the National Security Operations Center (NSOC),<br>Tailored Access,<br>Link Access,<br>Cryptanalysis and Exploitation (CES),<br>Geocell,<br>our Second Party partners, and many more.<br>(S//SI) A shining example of focused mission support to the Games was that being provided by<br>the Link Access Support to the Olympics (LASO) team. Comprised of subject matter experts<br>from the Office of Overhead (OH), Radio Frequency Operations (RFO), Special Collection Service<br>(SCS) and Special Source Operations (SSO), the LASO team was the focal point for everything<br>Olympics -- from planning to resource allocation through collection management and crisis<br>response -- for all Olympics security operations. LA team members supported the SID Olympics<br><br> </p>team for more than 10 months, and were in place well before the opening ceremonies.<br>(S//SI) NSA/CSS Olympic operations included several major initiatives within LA spanning its<br>accesses: BLUE FORCE TRACKING, SCS and SSO. SCS support included the activities of US966G and two survey sites (US-969X183 and US-969X202). SSO support included deployment of<br>access capabilities (APRIL FLOWERS) to directly support the Olympics. LA Olympic Operations<br>and the LASO Team concept were just a small part of the larger corporate effort to the XXVIII<br>Summer Olympiad made possible with the hard work and dedication of many NSA organizations<br>working together to achieve a common goal -- a safe Olympics!<br>Olympic stadium<br>Parthenon <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
