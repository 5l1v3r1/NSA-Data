With endorsement from the SIGINT Directors of<br>each of the 5-Eyes Partners (NSA, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, and CSE) and signing of the<br>SHAREDVISION Memorandum of Agreement in late June 2004, the FORNSAT Division, within<br>Link Access, formally launched the SHAREDVISION program . The ultimate goal of the program,<br>block change of the field site architecture, will be achieved by developing and deploying a<br>common, flexible, scalable, and responsive architecture to all the FORNSAT sites.<br>(S//SI) The most significant aspect of this ambitious program is the division of effort and use of<br>partnerships. As a model of 5-Eyes cooperation, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, and CSE are teaming with<br>NSA to create the SHAREDVISION system. Each partner is developing and providing components<br>or engineering talent to the effort, which is being managed by the SHAREDVISION Program<br>Management Office within the FORNSAT Division. Under this agreement, each partner is reliant<br>on the others to develop and support whole components of the overall SHAREDVISION system.<br>NSA will lead the integration of the system, but for perhaps the first time, a truly 5-Eyes system<br>development effort is underway.<br>(U//FOUO) For more details on the SHAREDVISION program, see the briefing at:<br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
