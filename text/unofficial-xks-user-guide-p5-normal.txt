Multisearch Username:

As you may have guessed, the Multisearch Username query is exactly the same as the
IP Address Query and the MAC Address except it only allows you to search on a target’s
Username. Follow the same instructions as the Multisearch IP Address query above but
replace the IP address with your Usemame(s).

“What is a Username?”

A “Username" in XKEYSCORE queries is the portion before the symbol in an
email address.

For example:

Abuiihad@hotmail.com:	Username = abujihad

Domain = yahoo.com
