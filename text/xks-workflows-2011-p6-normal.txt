How do I setup a workflow?

Two main ways

■ Based on the results of a recent query

Simplifies the process & more likely to produce
the desired result!

This is done by right-clicking on the result set from
the desired query and selecting Create Workflow
from this Search. This populates the Workflow
Wizard with the same criteria that was used by the
selected query.

■ From scratch using the Workflow Wizard

Not recommended - but we’ll show you anyway
