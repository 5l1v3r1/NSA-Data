Charlie Meals, Signals Intelligence<br>Deputy Director<br>FROM: Charlie Meals<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 10/13/2004<br>(U) Here's one in our series of interviews with SID leaders...<br>(U) What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(U//FOUO) There have been many memorable events. For example, I remember being on duty<br>in NSOC when we learned that the Soviets were invading Czechoslovakia. More recently, in April<br>2001, I was at NCPAC [NSA/CSS Pacific] when the Chinese forced down the U.S. Navy's EP-3<br>SIGINT collection aircraft. And, of course, there was 9/11.<br>(U//FOUO) But in terms of an overall experience, I would say that my first field tour at GCHQ in<br>Cheltenham, England really stands out in my mind. Becoming acquainted with a new<br>environment - an unfamiliar landscape, a different culture and people -- was very exciting and<br>fun. My field tour in Hawaii was also quite memorable.<br>(U) What was your first job at the Agency?<br>(S//SI) After serving four years in the Air Force, I came to NSA permanently in the late 60's and<br>worked in the Soviet "weather shop." It may sound odd now, but in those days the only<br>effective way the U.S. had of determining the weather in various parts of the Soviet Union was<br>to listen to their communications. The Soviets knew this, and actually encrypted the locations of<br>their weather reports.<br>(S//SI) You may ask why we needed the information. Well, the primary customer was the<br>Strategic Air Command (SAC), which needed to have current weather reports in case U.S.<br>bombers ever had to fly into Soviet air space. Weather reporting also served as an indicator or<br>warning of impending action. For example, we knew that the Soviets were serious about<br>invading Czechoslovakia in 1968 when they began to include Czech weather data on their<br>military weather broadcasts.<br>(S//SI) This weather effort was actually quite big: there were people at bases around the world<br>-- the UK, Germany, Pakistan, Italy, Japan, etc. - as well as about 250 people here at NSA<br>working the target. More than 30 years ago, I was the first person to serve in NSOC as a<br>weather analyst and the desk still operates today.<br>(U) If you could give one piece of advice to employees just starting their SIGINT career,<br>what would it be?<br>(U) I would say: "Be open to opportunities." When you have been doing a job for a while and feel<br>very competent, it's tempting to continue in that role indefinitely. But periodically it's a good<br>thing to step outside your comfort zone and try new things. If you take the risk, you may<br>achieve a greater payback. You may even find that you end up in a very different place than you<br>began -- for example, the Director used to work as a Bulgarian linguist!<br>(U//FOUO) See other interviews in this series:<br>Interview with...
