DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) TRAILBLAZER: Not Just an 11-Letter Word<br>FROM: (Name Withheld by Request)<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 04/29/2004<br>FROM: (Name Withheld by Request) <br>Unknown <br>(U//FOUO) As a dyed-in-the-wool SIGINTer recently assigned (analyst comment: note my lack<br>of the use of "volunteer") to TRAILBLAZER, I approached my new job with a certain skepticism. I<br>knew TRAILBLAZER had been around for a while... and I had steadfastly avoided it. The best<br>analogy in my own experience was NSOC. After also steadfastly avoiding NSOC for years due to<br>the shift work, I finally accepted a position there. What I found in NSOC was a job and work<br>environment sufficiently rewarding that it moved me to volunteer for another position and a<br>second tour there later in my career. Now that I'm on the TRAILBLAZER team, I can see where<br>history may repeat itself!<br>(U//FOUO) Upon arrival I did, of course, get all the new-person briefings and was referred to the<br>TRAILBLAZER homepage for additional background information. But I also did some research on<br>my own, and what I learned was: I hadn't been paying attention the last four years!!! Here are<br>just a few things the Director of NSA told all of us:<br>"We are beginning TRAILBLAZER 1. It is the prototype of our future." (DIRgram-37,<br>1/14/00)<br>"TRAILBLAZER 1 will map ... mission requirements to our cryptologic architecture and<br>provide implementation focus." (DIRgram-45, 2/3/00)<br>"TRAILBLAZER is the core of our strategy to exploit the global digital net and to<br>transform how we satisfy our customers' information needs." (DIRgram-122, 9/18/00)<br>"The TRAILBLAZER Technology Development Platform (TDP)... represents a significant<br>step forward in NSA's transformation. It demonstrates to our stakeholders, customers,<br>overseers, and partners, our continued commitment to transformation, despite many<br>mission pressures." (DIRgram-239, 6/13/02)<br>"Our top operational priority is the transformation of NSA into an enterprise that scales<br>to the challenge of the 21st Century target environment. Key to building an agile SIGINT<br>enterprise is a strategy in which the stovepiped solutions of the past are replaced by a<br>highly integrated, enterprise-level system-of-systems that closely couples our acquisition<br>programs. These programs include: TRAILBLAZER ..." (DIRgram-287, 9/02/03)<br>OK, the Director of NSA obviously got it. I had to wonder why I didn't. This is IMPORTANT stuff!<br>(U//FOUO) I still have a lot to learn. So many different organizational elements and so many<br>different disciplines are involved that the complexity is daunting. And if you go looking for<br>answers, you'll quickly learn that the perspectives of the people in those various disciplines still<br>influence how the TRAILBLAZER story gets told. Even in official documentation, it is (accurately)<br>described as both "a major DoD-NSA/CSS acquisition program" and "a major transformation<br>program."<br>(U//FOUO) The best, most up-to-date big picture I've found is in the TRAILBLAZER Program<br>Management Plan, which was published last November. In it, the Program Manager effectively<br>lays out the purpose and goals of the program. I would encourage everyone in SID to take the<br>time to look at it. A copy is available on-line on the TRAILBLAZER homepages under the "Tools"<br>section.<br>(U//FOUO) Reading both on and between the lines of all that, I rather quickly came to one<br><br> </p>inevitable conclusion: The future and the success of the National Security Agency's SIGINT<br>mission is inextricably linked to the success of the TRAILBLAZER Program. We have to make this<br>work.<br>(U//FOUO) If you have questions about TRAILBLAZER, contact <br>TRAILBLAZER Mission Office, at <br>.<br><br>) Chief,<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
