The coordination process between the ITDC; the MENA, CT, and GEO product lines;<br>the Army TCAE; the Meade Operations Center; and the Extended Enteprise is working smoothly<br>with analysts from across those organizations talking on a daily, if not hourly, basis. As a result,<br>we've scored some successes.<br>(S//SI) One example of the ITDC's success was its real-time support to the 82nd Airborne. On<br>25 February 2004, HUMINT indicated that a known insurgent leader was planning a mortar<br>attack against Camp Saint Michael, an 82nd Airborne forward operating base (FOB) located at Al<br>Mahmudiyah, Iraq. Acting on this HUMINT tip, analysts in the ITDC almost immediately<br>identified two telephones that had been active in that area, one of which had already been<br>identified as associated with the insurgent leader. The times and locations of the phones' activity<br>were passed to the 82nd Airborne for threat warning. A mortar attack did occur that evening,<br>with no casualties or damage to the base.<br>(S//SI) Over the next few days, ITDC analysts continued to watch the area, identifying another<br>telephone of interest, and reporting on the locations of the three devices. On 3 March, 82nd<br>Airborne and FOB Saint Michael assets conducted a raid on the areas identified in and around the<br>ITDC reporting. The operation was successful: they confiscated stockpiles of weapons including<br>mortars, rocket propelled grenades, and other small arms and apprehended at least 18<br>individuals. Through collaboration with the Army Technical Control and Analysis Element<br>(ATCAE), the ITDC was able to quickly provide threat warning information to the customer and<br>obtained, in some cases, real-time information when attacks on the base occurred, allowing<br>analysts to focus their discovery efforts on those times.<br>(S//SI) Many new targets are being passed from the development stage to the OPI's* for<br>sustained collection and enhanced support to forces in Iraq. In addition, the ITDC now issues<br>Informal Technical Notes (ITN's) documenting its analytic discoveries. Because these documents<br>contain SIGINT sources and methods, their dissemination is limited to members of the SIGINT<br>production chain; however, when the discovery analysis merits formal e-gram reporting, the ITN<br>is redrafted and issued by the appropriate OPI through the traditional reporting process to a<br>broader audience.<br>(S//SI) The ITDC has established a webpage (at "go itdc") where information can be found about<br>the ITDC and its mission. The titles of products issued as a result of ITDC analysis are listed<br>there. Unfortunately, classification issues prevent the entire text of the ITN's and resulting<br>product reports from being posted; however, a password-protected link is being set up where<br>these documents will be posted in future.<br>(S//SI) Of note, the ITDC has suspended its 24-hour presence. This concentrates the expertise<br>of the ITDC analysts to its core hours, and relies on the expertise of the already existing<br>watches (most notably, the GEO Watch and the CTWO**) to handle crises and requests for near<br>real-time support. This has worked out well, with cooperative efforts with GEO Watch being<br>especially successful.<br>*OPI = Office of Primary Interest <br>**CTWO = Counterterrorism Watch Office <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
