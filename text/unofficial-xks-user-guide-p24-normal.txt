Searching - Tips and Tricks

The Official XKEYSCORE Frequently Asked Questions page is located here:
http://xkevscore.rl .r.nsa/redmine/wiki/xkevscore/FAO. Here are some other dps/tricks
that may be useful

1.	Underscores in usernames:

If your selector has an underscore in it. you must precede the underscore with a backslash. For
example: abujihad would become searched as abu\_jihad. If you leave the underscore in the
query without the backslash, you are wildcarding a single character (see below).

To search on: abujihad@hotmail.com:

Bad query: Abu jihad
Good query: Abu\ jihad

If you search on “abu jihad” (without the backslash), you could bring back “abu ljihad”,
“abuTjihad”, "abuSjihad”, “abu-jihad”, etc... because you are wildcarding that character and
therefore you would be pulling on an entirely different selector.

2.	To search on a range of IP addresses:

IP Address Range:

202.82.86.224 - 202.82.86.244

Becomes this XKEYSCORE Query (entered in the IP Address as To, From, or Either):
regex:202\.82V86\.22[4-9] OR regex:202V82V86\.23[0-9] OR regex:202V82V86\.24[0^]

3. Boolean Search Descriptions (Wildcards. ANDs. QRs. etc):

OPERATOR	DESCRIPTION	USAGE
t	Not Equal Comparison	beginning of word (i.e. !joe and !sam)
or	Logical OR (Search for multiple values)	between words (i.e. osama or laden)
and	Logical AND (Search for combination value matches)	between words (ie. ♦osama* and *laden*) takes precedence over ORs
•	Multiple Character Wildcard	anywhere in word (i.e. *osam*bin*laden)
_	Single Character Wildcard	anywhere in word (i.e. _sam_bin_laden)
>	Greater Than Comparison	beginning of word (i.e. >00080 and <00111)
<	Less Than Comparison	beginning of word (i.e. >00080)
regex:	REGEX Expression	(i.e. to retrieve only numbers: regex:[0-9]*)
