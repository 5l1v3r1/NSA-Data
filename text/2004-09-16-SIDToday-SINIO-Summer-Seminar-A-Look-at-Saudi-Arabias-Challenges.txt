"A Look at Saudi Arabia's<br>Challenges" will be presented by <br> D/SINIO for Near East South Asia, and<br>Brenda Martineau, SINIO for Economics, on Tuesday, 21 September, from 1130-1300 in<br>Room 2N044 . Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for<br>instructions.<br>(U) Course Overview:<br>(U//FOUO) A key coalition partner in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, home to the al-Saud royal<br>family, the two major Islamic pilgrimage sites, and a changing national and foreign resident<br>population. Many challenges face the future stability of Saudi Arabia; in our Brown Bag, we will<br>concentrate on three areas:<br>Will the royal family succumb to age, corruption, and unpopularity? Or is there a<br>younger generation of royals ready to take over the helm? Is there a plan of succession<br>to the throne, and who might be pulling the strings in the background?<br>Does the country have insurmountable internal security challenges? How have Saudi<br>security forces reacted to the recent major terrorist attacks on Saudi territory? Have they<br>"finally woken up", and will Saudi cooperation with U.S. counter-terrorism efforts be<br>forthcoming?<br>With 50% of the population under the age of 18, is Saudi Arabia a "demographic<br>timebomb"? How do domestic issues determine the national future with respect to<br>education and economics? And what is the influence of the U.S.-Saudi relationship on<br>national affairs and economics?<br>(S) This brown bag session is classified (TS//SI).
