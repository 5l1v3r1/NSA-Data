DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) InSIDer's View of History : Desert One - The Iranian Hostage<br>Rescue Mission<br>FROM:<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 05/21/2004<br>FROM: <br>Unknown <br><br> <br><br>(TS//SI) I remember the night quite distinctly. It's one of those<br>occasions that will be indelibly marked in your memory, and in<br>some ways defines your perception of world events. It was April<br>24, 1980 and I was working the swing shift in the old Runway<br>Operations Center (ROC), located on the 2nd floor of the old Ops<br>building next to the old NSOC. Starting about three months prior to<br>that night, we would occasionally move off our assigned targets<br>(the former Soviet Union) and copy Iranian troposcatter emitters.<br>We called them "ducks" because they had a distinctive tone in the<br>maintenance channel, which sounded exactly like a quacking duck.<br>(TS//SI) We stayed on the emitters even though they weren't<br>loaded, i.e., they had absolutely no traffic on them. We did that on<br>three different nights during the previous three months, but we<br>didn't know why. Later we found out that the hostage rescue team<br>had made 3 penetrations into Iranian airspace in preparation for<br>the attempted rescue.<br>(TS//SI) That night I remember coming in about 1500. I was told<br>by the outgoing watch officer that the deputy division chief was<br>coming down to brief us about an ongoing mission. At about 1600<br> Deputy Chief A14, arrived in the ROC and called the<br>outgoing watch officer,<br> and me over to the side of the<br>room.   was a tall man, and he leaned over to speak softly to us<br>so that no one else could hear. "The Director (Vice Admiral Bobby<br>Inman) holds everyone who receives this briefing personally<br>responsible for the lives of the hostages and the rescue team.<br>Operation Ricebowl is underway." We just stared at him with a<br>stunned look on our faces. He must have sensed that we didn't<br>know what he was talking about, because just as he started to turn<br>around to leave he quickly turned back. "The Iranian Air Defense<br>troposcatters that you've been copying for months - it was in<br>preparation for a rescue mission of the hostages in Iran. It's a go."<br>(TS//SI) The entire night we looked for indications that the Iranian<br>Air Defense system had detected the rescue team as they entered<br>Iranian airspace and landed at the Desert One site. (We knew the<br>parameters of the Iranian Air Defense system because it was U.S.<br>equipment and installed by U.S. contractors while the Shah of Iran<br>was still in power. We knew exactly where the gaps in coverage<br>were and we exploited it during the rescue attempt.) We heard<br>absolutely nothing the entire night, and I went home at midnight<br>without knowing anything about the results of the mission.<br>(U) The next morning I got up about 0900 and went downstairs for<br>breakfast. The kids were already at school and my wife started the<br>coffee and turned on the TV as I sat down at the table. There was a<br>special newscast on and some reporter at the Pentagon was talking<br>about a developing story. My wife came out of the kitchen as the<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.  InSIDer's View of<br>History ... A Lesson<br>in Personal<br>Accountability<br>2.
