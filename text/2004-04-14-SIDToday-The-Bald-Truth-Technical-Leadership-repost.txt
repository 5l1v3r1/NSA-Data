Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 04/14/2004<br><br>(U) Some of the feedback from my previous articles asked about my thoughts<br>on technical leadership. As usual, I have an opinion - let me know if you agree.<br>(U) First of all, we are a technical agency and always will be. Our technical capabilities and high<br>tech nature are found in the brains of our people. Fundamentally, technical leadership has<br>something to do with leading technical people. We need to have strong programs to hire,<br>develop and retain technical people (BTW, as a former East German linguist, I include language<br>analysts and such as technical people). We have some pretty good programs for this. Technical<br>leadership will have to be focused on the human capital. Senior technical people have to lead,<br>mentor and take responsibility for building our future. Technical leadership also entails keeping<br>yourself current in your field.<br>(U) But there are several other aspects of this domain. First it is a legitimate function of a<br>technical leader to "tell the geeks when they are done." Seems flip, I know, but no disrespect<br>meant when I tell you what you already know: software is never "done" and somebody has to<br>declare victory. Perfect really is the enemy of good enough. We have pretty high standards, so<br>"good enough" never means shoddy or compromised, but let's face it: the job has to be finished<br>sometime . This decision is a skill that can be learned, but it essentially comes from an exquisite<br>understanding of the requirements and a solid business sense for when they are achieved<br>(remember "Business Acumen"? You are supposed to have some if you are a leader).<br>(U//FOUO) A second aspect of technical leadership is what I call alignment. In the 70's we often<br>built things because we could - if it can be done, why not build it? In the 80's and 90's it had to<br>be feasible and also important. Now we have the third criterion: can we afford it? This means<br>that there are ideas and systems that are feasible and even important that we will not build. No<br>kidding, we could have a lifesaving idea that will not make the cut. Technical leadership has to<br>draw that cut line. A technical leader does this by reviewing the guidance and priorities that<br>come from the strategic plan and ensuring that every project and program conforms to that<br>plan. Further - and this is where the real technical part comes in - the technical leader ensures<br>that the solution is as efficient, reusable and networked into the service-based architecture. For<br>instance, if you are building a database that does not use the PKI architecture (or worse invents<br>its own), then you are wrong. A technical leader ensures this does not happen.<br>(U//FOUO) Technical leadership insists on a rigorous scrub of requirements and alignment - it<br>just has to be habitual and ingrained in our culture. This third aspect is necessary for our<br>technical reputation but not sufficient. The last aspect of technical leadership is the mandate to<br>create. Technical leadership is about sheer creativity. To be successful in the future we have to<br>actually invent new ideas, techniques and applications. We will look to the technical leaders to<br>come up with some no-kidding killer applications. We want to massively surprise our enemies<br>with capabilities they cannot imagine. Our technical leadership can imagine them and will.<br>Invent anything lately?<br>(U) One last question: Is technical leadership an oxymoron? I don't think so. Being a "techie" is<br>not a license to withdraw from the leadership field. Neither is grade. Wherever you find yourself,<br>whatever your grade, you must lead. Just do it.<br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: This article first appeared on October 24th,<br>2003.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
