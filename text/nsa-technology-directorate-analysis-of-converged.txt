Analysis of Converged Data

Converged data leads to better analysis, which leads to more focused tasking

Note: Our goals for high-level tasking are to relieve the user
from needing to know / care about the details. For example, a
user should be able to ask for "all details about application X"
and not need to know how and where the application keeps
files, registry entries, user application data, etc.
