I, attended the FAIRVIEW partner provided tour of one of
tn^p^g^m's east coast cable stations (NASSAU SHORE) and the
program's centralized processing SCIF (PINECONE). A short FAIRVIEW
overview was provided which led into an in-depth technical
discussion regarding the program's vast access & collection
infrastructure, the varying data flows (i.e., DNI, DNR, CDRs, etc.)
to include program authorities, budget constraints, sensor
deployments (ETML, VANGUARD and NETFLOW), and endpoint-midpoint
shaping activities and future opportunities in partnership with
organizations such as TAO, NCSC and other IC elements such as the
FBI, DEA and the CIA. The partner also provided a briefing on
company/USG activities outside of FAIRVIEW (i.e., NEST, DIB Pilot)
and expounded on current and future program Cyber plans. The day was
extremely successful and broadened their understanding of this
unique Government/Partner relationship, highlighted the Partner's
ability and willingness to help with NSA's SIGINT and Cyber
missions, provided insight into the breadth and depth of the
program's access and showcased the highly collaborative nature of
the FAIRVIEW partner and the value of their intellectual capital.
