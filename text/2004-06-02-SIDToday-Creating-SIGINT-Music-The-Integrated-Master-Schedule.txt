The SIGINT Systems Engineering Office (S01A) maintains a SID Integrated Master<br>Schedule (IMS) for all of the developing and deployed systems to ensure that all these efforts<br>work together to create music, not just noise.<br>(U) Major General Quirk, as the conductor of the SID orchestra, is responsible for selecting the<br>music, setting the tempo, and cuing the various sections (S0, S1, S2, S31, S32, and S33) to<br>play their parts. The SID IMS goal is to support him and other SID/ NSA leaders in:<br>Monitoring the progress &amp; status of projects<br>Controlling the impact of project schedule changes<br>Supporting the integration of transformational PEO (Program Executive Office - DA4)<br>projects<br>(U//FOUO) To accomplish this goal, SIGINT SEO tracks:<br>System/Service Deliveries,<br>Key Project Milestones,<br>Inter-project Dependencies<br>for all of the SID system related projects/subprojects. In addition to producing a schedule for all<br>these activities, we also track changes to the project schedules and analyze the schedule risk<br>each quarter. (See the SID IMS Analysis Reports .)<br>(U//FOUO) These efforts have resulted in two major achievements for SID and one highly<br>significant overarching achievement for NSA. For the first time, in the latest version of the SID<br>IMS, all 51 "system related" projects provided schedules that were evaluated. Secondly, working<br>with the SIGINT Lead Systems Engineers and IMS Points of Contact within the SID<br>Organizations, none of the projects were assessed as high or "red" schedule risk. In addition to<br>providing support to SID/NSA leaders, the SID IMS provided a significant input to the 31 March<br>2004 Congressional report on NSA systems that resulted in the release of $100M that Congress<br>had withheld.<br>(U//FOUO) These achievements, and our continuing improvements to the SID IMS, reflect a<br>strong SID commitment to the creation, use, and coordination of schedules. The SID IMS acts as<br>the metronome that assures that the SIGINT orchestra plays well together and meets the<br>NSA/CSS strategic goals of:<br>Deliver Responsive Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance for National Security<br>Under Any Circumstance<br>Radically Improve the Production and Protection of Information<br>(U//FOUO) For more information about the SID IMS, contact the IMS POC in your organization:<br>Organization<br><br>S01A1: SID SEO<br><br>IMS POCs<br>George Laskey (<br> (<br> (<br> (<br><br>) <br>) <br><br>) <br>) <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"> (<br> (<br><br>S1: Customer Relationships<br>S2: Analysis &amp; Production<br><br> (<br> (<br><br>S31: CES<br><br>) <br> (<br><br>S33: Link Access<br><br> (<br><br> <br> (<br><br> <br><br>) <br><br>) <br> (<br><br>S32: TAO<br><br>DA4: PEO<br><br>) <br>) <br><br> <br>) <br><br>) <br><br>) <br>)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
