The Campaign, established by Executive Order in 1961<br>by John F. Kennedy, is a painless way to ease someone else's pain. This year's theme, "Every 1<br>of US," reflects the notion that we are all in this together and every one of us can be a hero.<br>Last year the Agency alone donated $1,596,199.20. This year, the goal is $1.6 million. Working<br>together, I am sure that we can make this happen.<br>(U) However, the CFC won't be all work. The Campaign will sponsor events that will not only be<br>enjoyable, but will raise funds for this very worthy cause as well. For a list of upcoming CFC<br>activities, visit " go cfc ".<br>(U) As we at NSA go about our daily business of protecting our country, we should also<br>remember that the United States is made up of individuals. Some of these individuals at times<br>cannot help themselves. Some of these individuals are trying to help others. So, although you<br>may not be able to push a wheelchair, save an endangered species, read a book to a<br>disadvantaged child or find a medical cure, by donating money through the CFC, you will be<br>providing very practical help to many different non-profit organizations that are doing those<br>things and much more. With over 2,600 local, national and international organizations available<br>for your contributions, there is a charity that everyone can feel good about supporting.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
