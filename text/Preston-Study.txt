Highlights

London G20 Event- In contrast to other recent events (e.g
Mumbai) most of the useful collection on this event came from
‘traditional’ sources - mainly Preston

• Preston Study- Nonetheless a very small proportion of
Preston traffic is normally viewed. This may be of concern as
this traffic is warranted.

• CPC, RPC- traffic collection increasing steadily and all IPTs
profiting

INA Transformation- INA collection,viewing and EPR
increasing

Whilst Preston collection made up the bulk of the reporting on G20, it is clear from the above figures that only a small
proportion of the Preston Traffic is viewed. This is of concern as the collection is all warranted. However note caveat below:
Viewing figures from some repositories including Xkeyscore/Salamanca and Haustorium are not included in these statistics
as currently Artemis does not receive a feed from them. Full events feeds should be available by 2nd Q next year.

•	Only 3% of PRESTON collection over the last 6 months was viewed. - As noted in previous slide,viewing figures from
events repositories are not available

•	Collection info is only available for ZAMENSIS, REMEDY, GERONTIC, CATSUP and CONDONE.The other sources
relate to billing data and as noted Artemis does not yet have a feed from events data bases.

•	It is interesting to note that some of these accesses (UKC123A-Laboro and UKC126-Larkspur) were lost between a
year and 2 years ago but historical data in repositories is clearly still proving useful.
