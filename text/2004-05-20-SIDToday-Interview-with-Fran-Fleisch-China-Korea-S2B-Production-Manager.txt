DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Interview with... Fran Fleisch, China &amp; Korea (S2B)<br>Production Manager<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 05/20/2004<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications <br>Unknown <br>(U//FOUO) What follows is the first installment of a new SIDtoday feature, the "Interview<br>With..." series. These articles are in a question-and-answer format, with managers describing<br>how the world looks from their vantage point. We'll ask them to both look back on their careers<br>and to tell us what lies in store for the organizations they lead. Our first interviewee is Fran<br>Fleisch, Production Manager for China and Korea :<br>(U) What was your first job at the Agency?<br>(S//SI) I hired on at the Agency in February 1980 as a Russian graphic linguist as part of a huge<br>hiring surge against the Soviet target. Assigned to A4, the office which worked the Soviet civil<br>targets, I spent my first year in training - classroom and OJT - before finally getting to contribute<br>to production.<br>(S//SI) My first substantive analytic and reporting assignment was to follow the special Soviet<br>troops which built sensitive military facilities - such as IRBM and ICBM* bases and radar<br>facilities. SIGINT was typically the first evidence of these planned deployments and was<br>routinely used to cross-cue imagery. Pretty extraordinary stuff for an Economics and Finance<br>major, with some Russian language capability, who applied to the Agency on a lark.<br>(U) What is the biggest change you've seen at the Agency in your career?<br>(U//FOUO) The single most pervasive change I've seen over the course of my 24 year career at<br>the Agency is the application of technology to enable our analytic work. At the risk of dating<br>myself, I'll call out that in my first years at the Agency, I wrote out my reports in longhand. We<br>typed our reports on the single typewriter in the branch and did not have computers in our area.<br>While we continue to strive to equip our analysts with state-of-the-art tools, the power of the<br>computers and analytic tools that analysts have today is awesome by comparison to the early<br>1980s when I came on board.<br>(U) What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?<br>(TS//SI) On a personal note, clearly my most memorable experience was meeting - and<br>subsequently marrying - my husband. We EODed* within a month of each other and were<br>assigned to the same office initially. From an operational perspective, my most memorable<br>experience was one I really can't talk about in detail - multiple deployments for a sister agency<br>to visit the target country I was following at the time. More recently, I had the opportunity to<br>accompany the ADCI*/Community Management Joan Dempsey on a tour of the Far East in 2002<br>visiting Hong Kong, Taiwan, the PRC and Thailand. That trip, my first ever to the region and as<br>part of a high-level US delegation, was a fabulous learning experience and introduction to<br>enterprise and foreign partners.<br>(U) What is the biggest challenge facing your organization right now?<br>(S//SI) The China/Korea Product Line leads activities enterprise-wide against two of the DCI's<br>top priorities: China and Korea, which are both designated Hard Targets. My challenge every<br>day is to optimize our activities to meet customer information needs in the face of access,<br>processing and analytic shortfalls. We are very fortunate that Congress has recently authorized<br>extra funding for our analytic efforts on the China target, with an emphasis on leadership,<br>submarines, C4ISR* and mobile missiles.<br><br> </p>(U) What is the most exciting project for the future that your organization is currently<br>undertaking?<br>(U//FOUO) I'd like to rephrase your question if you don't mind and substitute "initiative" for<br>"project". Our most exciting initiative - undertaken with the assistance of multiple enabling<br>organizations including HR, Security, and the skill communities - is our hiring program. Over the<br>last several years, the Agency has authorized an increase in hiring - linguists, intelligence<br>analysts, global network analysts - to prosecute the China and Korea missions. Today nearly one<br>third of our product line civilian workforce is comprised of new hires in development programs and the contributions that they are making are extraordinary. Being taught by our seasoned<br>professionals and complementing our very talented military workforce, these new hires are the<br>future of the Agency. And the future is bright.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>IRBM = Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile <br>ICBM = Intercontinental Ballistic Missile <br>EOD = Entered on Duty <br>ADCI = Assistant Director of Central Intelligence <br>C4ISR = Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and<br>Reconnaissance <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
