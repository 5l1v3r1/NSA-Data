 

(TSNSIHWF) FAA Certi?cation Renewals With Caveats

Ey?on?l?l r-rc-rs 

(TSNSIHNF) The FISA Corut signed the 2011 FAA Certi?cations on 3 Dot 2011 these
are valid rurtil 2 |Dot 21312, permitting FAA?authorized accesses to continue
operations. However, in the Sit-page opinion, the judge ordered certain ?upstream? or
?passive? FAA DNI collection to cease after 3U days, unless NSA implements solutions
to correct all de?ciencies identi?ed in the opinion document. PRISM operations are not
affected by these caveats. All PRISM providers, except Yahoo and |Google, were
successfully transitioned to the new Certi?cations- We expect Yahoo and Google to
complete transitioning by Friday Get. Regarding the FAA collection
programs, the Court cited targeting and minimization procedures related to collection of
Multiple Communications Transactions as ?de?cient on statutory and comtitutional
grounds.? Teclurology Directorate, CIGC, and other organisations are coordinating a
response, which includes planning to implement a conservative solution in which the
higher-risk collection will he sequestered- It is possible that this higher risk collection
contains much of the non-duplicative FAA collection resulting in FAA reporting ??om
upstream accesses. This solution is designed to comply with the judge?s order, however,
the judge will have to determine if it does. If the solution is installed, will then work
with DPIs and DIS-C to modify the solution over time such that the ?ltering process will
be optimized to permit more valid collection to be processed and forwarded to DFls.
Finally, in parallel with these efforts, the DOC is contemplating ?ling an appeal to the
ruling.
