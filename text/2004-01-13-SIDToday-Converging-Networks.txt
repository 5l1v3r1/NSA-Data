These devices -- including laptops and PCs (personal<br>computers), GSM and other cell phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), satellite phones, web<br>portals, etc. -- allow targets to contact one another across various communications media in<br>near and real time. NSA's exploitation of these modern communications technologies and<br>applications, however, tends to be compartmented by technology, tool, data type, etc. This<br>situation has made it extremely difficult for analysts to put the various cross-media pieces of a<br>target's communication "back together."<br>(TS//SI) Offices are working, however, to find a solution! Counterterrorism TTEC analysts have<br>partnered with CT Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) Development analysts, Corporate SIGINT<br>Development offices, and Rebuilding Analysis to identify gaps in analytic tools and techniques,<br>and to use the corporate requirements process to submit Analytic Needs Requirements that,<br>when filled, will enable intelligence analysts to exploit cross-media communications.<br>(TS//SI) Meanwhile, steps are being taken to improve SID's capabilities in the near term. For<br>example, SIGINT Development's Target Development Services Division , working with the CES<br>Filtering and Selection IPT (Integrated Product Team), is carrying out the following initiatives:<br>One number, maximum reach : The goal of this project is to modify current telephony selector<br>management to a system in which the full OCTAVE load is pushed to each field site through a<br>filter of site specific tasking rules, thus maximizing worldwide collection for each number.<br>DNI contact chaining : Create the capability to do email contact chaining, and lay the<br>foundation to expand the capability to include additional DNI protocols, e.g. chat, and further lay<br>a foundation toward the longer-term goal of cross-media/cross-mode contact chaining.<br>DNI selector management : Create an environment in which TOPI analysts who wish to task email addresses or phone numbers for communications intercept may do so with a single entry<br>into OCTAVE and eliminating the necessity for time-intensive best-sites-to-task decision making<br>by analysts.<br>Distributed field site architecture : NSA's collection architecture must become as distributed as<br>the network it is attempting to collect.<br>Cross-mode analysis : Seeks to gather intelligence from a target as he/she changes<br>communications mode, e.g. telephone to email.<br>(For additional details of these initiatives, see SIGDev's convergence briefing .)<br>(TS//SI) We hope you bring you more articles in future to update you on SID's efforts in dealing<br><br> </p>with converging networks!<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on the above topic, please contact the following pocs:<br>TTEC (S2I34): <br> nsa,<br>Target Development Services (S2S3): <br><br>(s)<br><br> - <br><br>@nsa,<br><br>s)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
