Background

•	International Treaty opened for signature in 1992 as
the UNFCCC

•	Kyoto Protocol agreed in 1997

•	Defined first commitment period for certain
‘developed’ countries (2008-12)

- It agreed GHG emissions reductions by % of 1990 levels

•	Second commitment period needed to include
commitments for ‘developing’ countries (a ‘KP2’)

•	192 countries now party to UNFCCC

The Players

•	UK - negotiates as part of EU and plays a
leading role

•	Major developed countries e.g. USA and
Canada

•	Major developing countries - BASIC (Brazil,
South Africa, India, China)

•	COP hosts (Mexico)

•	Vulnerable countries - AOSIS, G77

•	Other influencers e.g. OPEC

Opposing views and
Sticking Points

•	Historic responsibility of developed countries

•	Emissions reductions seen as a way of
slowing growth of emerging powers

•	Money and technology for developing nations
for clean energy, adaptation and mitigation
(the Green Fund or „Fast-Start")

•	Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV)

•	An agreement binding developed and
developing countries

The road to Cancun

•	2007 COP13, Bali: the first time that climate change became a serious
intelligence priority - COP13 has to work!

•	Spring MEF meeting in Paris: our first GCO climate change deployment

Some lessons learned!

•	2008 COP14, Poznan: not expected to be a significant gathering

•	2009 COP15, Copenhagen or bust (it bust!)

“The Copenhagen Accord”

Our first COP climate change GCO deployment

...a success

•	2010 COP16, low ambition, low expectation, but hugely important

The talks must get back on track

What"s the role for
intelligence?

Political decisions often made in advance

•	What do governments want?

•	What will they sign up to?

•	What are the negotiating positions on broad or specific issues?

•	What are their red lines?

•	Views about other countries

•	Who is aligning with who?

•	Who is lobbying who?

•	Who are the spoilers?

•	Are delegates reporting back and getting fresh
instructions?

•	What are they?

•	FCO

-	Diplomats

-	SOSFCAs Special Representative

•	Department for International Development

•	Treasury

•	G20 representatives

Now...where did I put my
sombrero?

•	Why did we decide to send someone to Cancun?

-	Customers wanted us to be there

-	High likelihood of relevant, time-sensitive intelligence

-	First opportunity to show a new ministerial team what we can do

•	Preparations

-	Suitable cover within UK delegation

-	Logistics (kit, rooms, passes, delegate lists, etc)

-	Introductions with customers

-	Intelligence requirements

-	Coordination in HQ

•	With other teams and SIS

•	Methodology for delivery

•	Working patterns

•	Policy clearance

Why was Cancun a
success?

•	The talks didn't fail and...

•	Agreed that emissions should peak at 2oC

•	Anchored emissions reduction pledges from the
Copenhagen Accord

•	Agreed a system of MRV

•	Green Fund established

•	Agreed to reduce emissions from deforestation

•	Set up mechanisms for developed countries to
access low carbon technology

The future

• Continue to support negotiations, but...

-	How are South Africa approaching COP17?

-	Who is backing Qatar and South Korea in their
bids for COP18?

-	A KP2 is looking unlikely, but.

-	.some kind of multi-stage, bolt on agreement is
probably achievable

-	A low carbon economy through efficiency and new
technology could help achieve climate change
goals.good for the economy and probably trade

New challenges for
intelligence

•	Policy questions

Fewer disputing science - climate change happening and almost
certainly man-made, so...

-	Is low carbon ambition driving government and investor decisions
in economies?

-	Is UNFCCC still important or is private capital shifting to low carbon
because costs and scarcity of resource make sense?

-	Are governments making the link between extreme weather and
high commodity prices?

-	Are governments planning for instability or mass migrations caused
by water/food scarcity, lack of natural resources and land-use
change?

•	Competing intelligence priorities

Questions?
