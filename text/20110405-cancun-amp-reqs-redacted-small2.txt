 INTELLIGENCE
 SERVICE,

 

 

- 2007 COP13, Bali: the first time that climate change became a serious
intelligence priority COP13 has to work!

- Spring MEF meeting in Paris: our first GCO climate change deployment
Some lessons learned!

- 2008 COP14, Poznan: not expected to be a significant gathering
- 2009 COP15, Copenhagen or bust (it bust!)

?The Copenhagen Accord?

Our first COP climate change GCO deployment

- 2010 COP16, low ambition, low expectation, but hugely important

The talks must get back on track

How are South Africa approaching

New challenges for

  intelligence

 

- Policy questions

Fewer disputing science climate change happening and almost
certainly man-made, 

ls low carbon ambition driving government and investor decisions
in economies?

Is still important or is private capital shifting to low carbon
because costs and scarcity of resource make sense?

Are governments making the link between extreme weather and
high commodity prices?

Are governments planning for instability or mass migrations caused
by water/food scarcity, lack of natural resources and land-use
change?
