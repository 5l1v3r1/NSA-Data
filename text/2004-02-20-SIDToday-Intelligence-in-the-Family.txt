Today we have<br>another story (anonymous) of how intelligence can be a "family business."<br>(U//FOUO) I have a brother who is over ten years older than me, and ever since I was old<br>enough to remember where he worked, I knew he worked for the State Department. When it<br>came time for me to apply for a job, I went to an information session about NSA. it sounded<br>cool, so I applied.<br>(U//FOUO) When I flew out for my polygraph, I got my first hint of the "family secret." The<br>polygrapher asked if I had any close relatives who worked for the Agency, and I said "no". She<br>then asked about my brother, by name. Confused, I said, "No, he works for the State Dept."<br>That won me a condescending nod and ended the discussion.<br>(U//FOUO) This incident made sense to me some time later, after I had been working at the<br>Agency for a while. I received an email from an NSA employee whose name looked familiar... it<br>was my brother! Little did I suspect when I joined NSA that for many years I'd had family<br>connections at the Agency!<br>(U) If you have an interesting story, we'd like to hear it! Please contact us.
