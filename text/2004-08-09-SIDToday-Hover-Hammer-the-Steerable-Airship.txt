It can be manned or remotely piloted and has already done demonstration flights up to<br>10,700 feet. The National Tactical Integration Office National Tactical Integration Office here at<br>NSA mounted a Digital Receiver Technology model 1301 receiver onboard the airship, that was<br>remotely operated via line-of-sight radio by a ground based operator. The airship launched from<br>an airfield near Solomons Island, Maryland and was able to intercept international shipping data<br>emanating from the Long Island, New York area, including lines of bearing.<br>(U) It is a helium-filled sphere inside another sphere, constructed of Spectra, the same material<br>used to make bullet-proof vests. It has a 1000 lb payload capacity at present, with a planned<br>5000 lb capacity. It "hovers" above small arms fire, has a negligible IR signature, and radar<br>can't detect it. In an early-1980's incident, a straying balloon stayed aloft despite being strafed<br>twice by an F-16 fighter.<br>(U) More experiments, including the use of onboard imagery sensors, are being conducted. The<br>current plans are to develop the airship for unmanned operations at altitudes of approximately<br>20,000 feet for up to 48 hours. Future variants are planned to be 200 feet in diameter and will<br>operate at 68,000 feet with mission durations of up to six months. NTIO and S3's Tactical<br>Platforms are already collaborating on options for deploying SIGINT systems on this platform.<br>(U//FOUO) More information on Hover Hammer is available from NTIO ("go NSA-NTI" on NSA<br>Net) -- the poc is <br> Chief of the Air Operations and Programs<br>Branch (S1411).<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
