While we're striking down<br>stereotypes, the FBI -- which many view as a "law enforcement customer" -- is also considered<br>a member of the Intelligence Community (IC), which is why we answer their call for help in<br>cases like this.<br>(U//FOUO) As a bit of background, both national party conventions were declared by the<br>Secretary for Homeland Security Thomas Ridge and Attorney General John Ashcroft to be<br>"National Special Security Events" (NSSEs) on May 27, 2004. Being designated an NSSE means<br>federal resources are deployed to maintain the level of security needed for the event and area,<br>with the goal of preventing terrorist attacks and criminal acts. The United States Secret Service<br>(USSS) assumes the role of Lead Federal Agency (LFA) for the design and implementation of the<br>operational security plan for the event; the FBI is the LFA for intelligence and counterterrorism<br>(CT) support.<br>(S) Combine this with the fact that since Spring 2004, practically every agency, bureau, and<br>committee has concluded that there are serious potential threats to the U.S. homeland during<br>the national election and holiday periods and you can understand the need for domestic and<br>foreign support for such large scale activities-or some might say, targets-as the DNC and RNC.<br>(C) While there are no SIGINT indications or domestic intelligence from law enforcement sources<br>that corroborate this threat, it was the job of the six SID personnel deployed for this duty to be<br>alert to any SIGINT that might be of interest to the other IC members present in the Intelligence<br>Operations Center (IOC), at each convention. If needed, this information could be sanitized out<br>of COMINT channels to be shared with non-COMINT-cleared personnel on site, or, in the instance<br>of a threat, could be declassified -- working through the Senior Operations Officer (SOO) in the<br>National Security Operations Center (NSOC) -- for sharing with uncleared federal, state, and<br>local officials in the USSS-led Multi-Agency Center.<br>(S) NSA's presence at the DNC and RNC was duly noted and appreciated. While the "face" of this<br>effort was the individuals sitting the NSA positions at both locations, NSA's success was<br>definitely a team effort. Communications back to the Fort were a key concern. In Boston, the<br>job was made possible by the outstanding technical support provided by six people deployed<br>from ITIS' Systems Installation Services Division (AS23) and Telecommunications &amp; Network<br>Support to Deployed Operations Division (AS24). They provided the necessary secure<br>communications back to NSA HQ and NSANet.<br>(S) In New York, we were fortunate enough to be able to use existing communications paths to<br>access current and historical reporting and collateral. Also, while the members of the forward<br>deployed teams were all SID personnel, they worked closely and seamlessly with counterparts in<br>the Information Assurance Directorate, S2 Product Lines, NSOC, and NSA/CSS' Homeland<br>Security Support Office (D08).<br>(U//FOUO) Now that everyone's back safely and the "lessons learned" process is underway, we<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">applaud all who worked to make this a success. This type of support is just one of many ways<br>SID helps FBI and Homeland Security in support of their primary missions: Protect the United<br>States from terrorist attacks.
