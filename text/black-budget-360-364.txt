(U) Project Description

(U//FOUO) The Human Language Technology (HLT) Research Project provides a coherent, concentrated
focus on language analytics to exploit the volume, variety, and velocity of communications that the
SIGINT system collects. HLT Research conducts research that supports the goals of the NSA/CSS' Analytic
Modernization effort. This Project complements NSA/CSS initiatives to strengthen the language analyst
workforce by providing the technologies that serve as force multipliers for analysts.

(U//FOUO) The HLT Research Project has an HLT Center of Excellence (COE) at Johns Hopkins University
to promote academic and industry interest in intelligence challenges and attract world-class talent to work on
IC HLT problems. The HLT COE focuses on critical intelligence needs that are not adequately addressed by
commercial technology or other government programs. The HLT Research Project also leverages programs at
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects
Activity (IARPA). DARPA and IARPA programs provide foundational HLT capabilities in automatic content
extraction, speech-to-text, machine translation, summarization, and question answering. The HLT Research
Project conducts research and advanced development necessary to bridge research results from DARPA’s and
IARPA’s efforts to SIGINT applications. This Project includes the Human Language Technology Research Sub-
Project.

(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Research and develop voice, text, video and image analytics to enable
fundamental language exploitation capabilities for all types of communication, regardless of medium.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Increase the number of languages, accuracy, and speed of results for keyword
search from machine-generated transformations of speech-to-text.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Conduct research and advanced development on automatic document image
analysis, particularly for handwritten documents, an extreme technical challenge. The primary emphasis
is on core capabilities to enable triage and keyword search on the diverse kinds of documents found in
intercept, including language and script identification and handwritten document detection, segmentation,
and analysis.

•	(U//FOUO) Research analytics that automatically analyze the linguistic content of communications. This
area comprises several technologies, including content extraction and machine translation. Content analytics
identifies and extracts information from language communications, turning a mass of unstructured text into
usable metadata.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Research, design, and develop analytics that enable deployment of HLT
capabilities nearer to the point of collection within the SIGINT system.

•	(U//FOUO) Support collaborative research into human language exploitation and machine learning with
commercial and academic partners.

•	(U//FOUO) Develop test and training data to support scientific research and evaluation.

•	(U//FOUO) Provide and maintain a computer lab to support in-house algorithm development, evaluation,
and proof-of-concept demonstrations of promising solutions.

•	(U//FOUO) Sustain support activities that foster cross-organizational and cross-discipline collaboration in
solving hard technical problems critical to the success of NSA/CSS’ SIGINT and cyber missions as well
technical health of the workforce.

(U) There are no new activities in this Project in FY 2013.

(U) OCO resources in this project are used to:

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Enable machine translation research and new speech processing capabilities
for Afghanistan and Pakistan dialects using state-of-the-art research findings in less-common languages and
by developing new language and dialect models.

(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:

•	(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Develop and deploy speech-to-text models for additional languages, where the
languages will be selected according to corporate NSA/CSS priorities, language analyst preparation, and
scientific assessment of technology readiness. [CCP_0106]

•	(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Extend name-finding solutions to support named-entity extraction for 12
additional languages, to include at least three languages that are less-commonly taught. Create and
demonstrate solutions in three to five languages for the much harder problem of extracting relations between
entities. These capabilities will yield automated solutions to uncover pertinent facts within both unstructured
written communications and spoken communications that have been transformed into text. [CCP_0106]

•	(U//FOUO) Design techniques to reduce by 25 percent hand-annotated data required to develop models in
support of speech-to-text solutions. [CCP_0106]

•	(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Research, develop, and demonstrate solutions for cross-lingual entity
disambiguation to enable analysts to perform language independent retrieval of communications to, from,
or about persons of interest from multi-lingual SIGINT data sets. [CCP_0106]

(U) Changes From FY 2012 to FY 2013:

(S//NF) Human Language Technology Research: -$4.7 million (-$5.1 Base, +$0.4 OCO). The aggregate
decrease is the result of:

•	(U) Increases:

— (S//NF) $0.4 million in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) accelerates new speech processing
capabilities and associated analyst applications for Afghanistan and Pakistan dialects.

TOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN

• (U) Decreases:

—	(S//NF) $5.0 million due to a FY 2012 Congressional add not sustained in FY 2013.

—	(S//NF) $0.1 million due to a planned programmatic reduction in travel and training.
