It<br>was a busy day filled with meetings. The meeting topics varied greatly and I wondered how Mr.<br>Berlin could keep it all straight. Before the first meeting, Mr. Berlin sat down with me and gave<br>me a brief overview of the day and what the various meetings were going to be about. He<br>explained exactly what the Chief of Staff's duties are and how he helps the SIGINT Director.<br>(U//FOUO) The first meeting covered a very hot topic: compensation reform. It was quite<br>interesting to hear about upper management's views and concerns about compensation reform.<br>The meetings and briefings continued throughout the morning, including a regular meeting with<br>SID leadership and the SOO update at NSOC, just to name a few. Around noon, I received a<br>lunch break. Mr. Berlin, on the other hand, had to stay in his office during lunch and deal with<br>paperwork and other issues that came up during the morning. After lunch the pace picked up<br>again as I sat in on five more meetings.<br>(U//FOUO) Throughout the day, during the short breaks between meetings or the walk between<br>meeting locations, Mr. Berlin spent time explaining some of the elements of the previous<br>meeting that I may not have understood and providing some behind-the-scenes insight. From<br>the importance of impromptu meetings in the hallway when you are going for coffee to the<br>importance of understanding your own weaknesses and learning to overcome them to make you<br>a better leader, there was a teaching opportunity after every meeting and Mr. Berlin took full<br>advantage of those opportunities.<br>(U//FOUO) At the end of the day, Mr. Berlin took time to show me the new SID staff office<br>spaces, introduce me to a lot of people, and explain what all the different staff organizations do.<br>(U//FOUO) This day allowed me to see SID and NSA from a whole different perspective. I got to<br>see first hand some of the issues that SID leadership faces and how they address those issues. I<br>had a unique experience where I got a candid peak into a day in the life of the SID Chief of Staff.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
