Having recently completed an Iraqi Weapons of Mass<br>Destruction tour, and working on a dynamic SIGINT assessment project for CENTCOM in my new<br>office, I found myself unsatisfied with the prospect of watching this war on CNN. On March 20,<br>the day after the first bombs fell in Iraq, I volunteered for a NIST deployment.<br>(S//REL) With other mission obligations to fulfill, I wasn't able to deploy until October 2003. By<br>that point, I hoped there would still be some value in going. "The war's over," people would say.<br>"Why would they send you to Iraq now ?" Within a few days of my deployment, it was clear that<br>perhaps the hardest part of this war was still being fought by tens of thousands of military<br>personnel. I would be serving as one of only six analysts tasked with providing SIGINT support<br>to capture/kill operations and force-protection actions executed by four large military divisions in<br>the Iraqi theater.<br>(S//REL) CSG Baghdad works hand-in-hand with the intelligence components of Combined Joint<br>Task Force 7 (CJTF-7), providing everything from regular reports on SIGINT activity in<br>suspicious areas to real-time tracking of targeted handsets during operations. Our team of fewer<br>than fifteen people serves as "NSA forward," working with CENTCOM and the CJTF-7 Intelligence<br>Fusion Center to support and protect almost 100,000 troops, controlling two-thirds of Iraq.<br>(S//REL) Unlike the sometimes black and white nature of active combat, the current situation in<br>Iraq is frequently gray. While local Iraqi contractors cheerfully pour concrete in our parking lot,<br>we don't really know if any of them are working with the terrorists lobbing mortars at our outer<br>walls. A routine afternoon of guard duty for a friend of mine suddenly turned when he was<br>narrowly missed by a sniper - while on our base. A colleague and I had lunch at the Al Rashid<br>hotel downtown a few short days before several rockets hit the building. After my first of many<br>nights walking home from work in my flack vest and Kevlar helmet, I thought, this isn't what I<br>had in mind when Iraq was so quiet this summer.<br>(S//REL) But if things have to get worse before they get better, they're certainly looking up now.<br>I am now three months into a four-month tour. During these three months, my team has<br>provided direct, actionable SIGINT support to dozens of operations that have resulted in the<br>capture or elimination of countless terrorists. One month ago, we were among the first to know<br>that Saddam Hussein had been captured.<br>(S//REL) As a civilian analyst, I never thought I'd have the opportunity to serve in a military<br>operation. After my time in Iraq, I have a new perspective on the men and women who protect<br>our nation's security on the front lines, while we support them from the rear. Having lived with<br>the troops for three months, in the same dusty tents, eating the same unremarkable chow, I<br>have begun to consider them family. Someday I'll show my grandchildren pictures of us opening<br>our Christmas care packages, members of four services and several civilian agencies all wearing<br>the same uniform. I'll tell the stories of being on watch when Ambassador Bremer announced,<br>"We got him." Of counting down to 2004 in Saddam's palace, still carrying our rifles and pistols<br>while defiantly enjoying our New Year's Eve party. Walking to my office through the inescapable<br>mud and home through "celebratory" fire.<br><br> </p>(S//REL) Mostly, I'll tell them how I traveled thousands of miles to see for myself that the work<br>we do really does make a difference to the boots on the ground. Having worked now through<br>three agency elements in Phases I-IV of OIF - at the Fort and in the field - I am firmly convinced<br>that neither side can work effectively without the other. I now see my work as both a privilege<br>and an awesome responsibility. When I return home, I surely won't miss the grueling shifts, the<br>dirt, the food, or the occasional fear. But I'll leave knowing that this country is well on its way to<br>recovery.
