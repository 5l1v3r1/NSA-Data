•	Detect electronic attack - aim to detect
distributed and automated behaviour

•	Idea from IDA/CCS SCAMP 2009

-	'Using degree distributions to detect
internet traffic anomalies' Scheinerman

•	Detect multiple IPs with same degree:

-	in-degree {distributed hacking/port
scanning)

-	out-degree {DDOS/bot tasking)

•	Graph: peak at in-degree - 10*1.8 = 63

-	Appears to be some sort of hacking
activity

-	Dictionary attack: cycling through range
of IPs on network, making 63 GET
requests to each

-	Trying 63 combinations of URl, with the
intent of getting a MySQL setup script
(basic exhaust)
