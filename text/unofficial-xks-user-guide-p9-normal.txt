“Where would I find passwords to use in this query?”

Passwords can be found in TUNINGFORK (c.g.. FoggyBottom). passed in the content of
emails or text messages, or from previous XKEYSCORE queries.

2.	Trying to discover logins and passwords on a network? NOTE: Logins and
passwords are valuable tools to enable Tailored Access Operations (TAO).

“What tools would I use to get the network information like a Mail Server, or Name
Server?”

NS Lookups tools on NSA net such as FOXTRAIL and Open Source tools such as
robtcx.com, ccntralops.net. and nctwork-tools.com arc a GREAT START. They provide
you with IP addresses for domains. You can then query on tlie foreign-hosled IP
addresses.
