As a result of this decision, in addition to his other duties,<br>General Hayden now serves as the U.S. Strategic Command's Deputy Commander for Network<br>Attack Planning and Integration . (See related DIRgram-336 .) Within NSA, MG Richard Quirk,<br>SIGINT Director, takes on additional duty as Assistant Deputy Commander.<br>(S) Computer Network Attack ( CNA ) is "operations to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy<br>information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks<br>themselves." So, for example, the U.S. may conduct CNA against an adversary in time of war.<br>Computer Network Exploitation ( CNE ), by contrast, involves the " gathering of data from<br>target or foreign automated information systems or networks" for intelligence purposes.<br>(S) How did DIRNSA come to be dual-hatted as part of a warfighting command? Over the past<br>couple of years there was extensive discussion across the Joint Staff and Department of Defense<br>on organizing for information operations in general and computer network operations in<br>particular. This led to a change in the Unified Command Plan assigning responsibility for the full<br>information operations mission, including computer network attack and defense, psychological<br>operations, military deception, electronic warfare, and operations security, to USSTRATCOM.<br>(S//SI) NSA/CSS joined this discussion at many levels, and over time gained acceptance of the<br>following principles:<br>1.  NSA/CSS fields the nation's most powerful capabilities for computer network exploitation.<br>2.  Computer network attack uses similar tools and techniques as computer network<br>exploitation. If you can exploit it, you can attack it.<br>3.  The expertise of "Team Meade" -- NSA/CSS and the former IOTC -- can help provide the<br>nation with powerful capabilities for attack as well as exploitation.<br>(S) Lt General Hayden's assignment as Deputy Commander for Network Attack Planning and<br>Integration is intended to leverage the expertise of Team Meade for USSTRATCOM's computer<br>network attack mission. To accomplish this, he established a new organization, the<br>USSTRATCOM Network Attack Support Staff (NASS), to support him in the Deputy<br>Commander role.<br>(S) The mission of the NASS is to plan CNA courses of action in support of Combatant<br>Commander requirements, to develop all-source intelligence requirements in support of CNA<br>planning, and to support USSTRATCOM in the development of standards to promote readiness of<br>DoD CNA forces and capabilities. Mr. Mike Shank, who served as Director IOTC, is Chief of Staff<br>for the Network Attack Support Staff. CAPT <br> USN, also coming out of IOTC, is his<br>deputy.<br>(U//FOUO) You'll be hearing more about the NASS in the coming months.
