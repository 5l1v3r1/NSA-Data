The DNI Throttle

I Implemented on the SMK Xkeyscore that does
filtering/selection on Dec 2007; Oct 09 at 
Feb 2010 SMK LPT

I Limits ALL Cadence categories to 1Gb/10k
sessions/day at and 

I Full take stored ONLY on Xkeyscores for ~3
days. Will have to query Xkeys for any DNI not
forwarded to Pinwale.

 

I 1Gb/day may decrease as other RAM A sites
increase their DNI take.
