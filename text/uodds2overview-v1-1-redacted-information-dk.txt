The DNI Throttle

I Implemented on the SMK Xkeyscore that does
filtering/selection on Dec 2007; Oct 09 at SPIN;
Feb 2010 SMK LPT

i Limits ALL Cadence categories to 1Gb/10k
sessions/day at US-3180 and US-3237.

i Full take stored ONLY on Xkeyscores for ~3
days. Will have to query Xkeys for any DNI not
forwarded to Pinwale.

i 1Gb/day may decrease as other RAM A sites
increase their DNI take.

RAM-A Tasking_________________________

i Ops trained/certified before using the system.

i All DNR/DNI tasking completed by Support
Hub; RAM-A CM provides support as needed.

i All DNR/DNI tasking is reviewed and Partner
offensive tasking deleted. Deletions based on
our taboo/scrubber lists. Deletes not pushed
back to TOPIs.

i TOPIs cannot review DNI categories for all
sites unless cleared REDHARVEST.
