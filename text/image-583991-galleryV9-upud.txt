QUANTUM NATION

QUANTUM NATION uses new TAO CNE tradecraft and automation to drive broad
scale initial access, specifically an SSG cloud-analytic to identify selectors in SSO
passive collection that are viable for end-point access, and the use of lightweight
CNE implants to obtain initial access and survey data delivered to the TOPI offices
via corporate SIGINT repositories. For More Information on QUANTUM NATION check
the QUANTUM NATION wiki page

Target Profiler now shows if a selector is vulnerable to a QUANTUM exploit. If your
target is valid for QUANTUM NATION, A "Vulnerable" link in Target Profiler will
appear. Simply click the link that sends an email to request QUANTUMNATION
tasking.

Note: QUANTUMNATION and standard QUANTUM tasking results in the same
exploitation technique. The main difference is QUANTUMNATION deploys a stage 0
implant and is able to be submitted by the TOPI. Any ios device will always get
VALIDATOR deployed._____________________________________________
