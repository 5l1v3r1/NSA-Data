This guide provides classi?cation guidance for AA. FISA
governs the conduct of certain electronic surveillance activities within the United States and
against US. persons, regardless of location, and requires surveillances be authorized by the
United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (USFISC), or in certain limited
circumstances, by the Attorney General. PAA was an interim version of the FISA modernization
legislation and allowed the DN1 and the Attorney General to jointly authorize the acquisition of
foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the United
States. FAA is the permanent FISA modernization legislation and is authorized by the USFISC.

FISA includes all NSA FISA (to include Business Records, Large Content 
FAA) and FBI FISA (to include Pen Register Trap Trace).

The phrases, ?seeks or obtains FISA authority? and ?seeks or obtains PAA
authority? used throughout this document include the fact that NSA collects/ processes/ analyzes/
retains/ produces and then disseminates foreign intelligence information and data.

Unless otherwise speci?ed, classi?cation guidance which concern NSA
FISA activities apply to all forms of NSA FISA, including FAA.

Consult with the Of?ce of General Counsel or the SID Of?ce of Oversight
and Compliance for guidance on when FISA or other special authorities are needed to conduct

SIGINT activities.

Note: Timetable for ISA, 1978 present; PAA and
Continuation, August 2007 July 2008; FAA, July 2008 present.
