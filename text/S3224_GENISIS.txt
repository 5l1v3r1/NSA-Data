GENESIS

Covert SIGINT Transceiver

(S//SI//REL) Commercial GSM handset that has been modified to include a
Software Defined Radio (SDR) and additional system memory. The internal SDR
allows a witting user to covertly perform network surveys, record RF spectrum, or
perform handset location in hostile environments.

(S//SI//REL) GENESIS Handset

(S//SI//REL) The GENESIS systems are designed to support covert operations in
hostile environments. A witting user would be able to survey the local environment
with the spectrum analyzer tool, select spectrum of interest to record, and download
the spectrum information via the integrated Ethernet to a laptop controller. The
GENESIS system could also be used, in conjunction with an active interrogator, as the
finishing tool when performing Find/Fix/Finish operations in unconventional
environments.
