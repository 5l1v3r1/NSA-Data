From a<br>SIGINT perspective, this has forced a fundamental change in the way we approach Global<br>Network communications.<br>(S//SI) Our target's use of commercial services have highlighted the need to coordinate<br>collection efforts across all available accesses in order to more effectively exploit the Global<br>Network. This approach stresses cooperation among the 5 Eyes partners on access availability<br>and the need to take full advantage of each partner's finite resources.<br>(TS//SI) The agenda for the three-day conference was comprehensive, with Heads of Delegation<br>keen to define the structure and governance of the GNF in addition to addressing topics<br>coordinated in the months prior to the forum. Of particular interest were the ratification of the<br>GNF charter and the documents proposing mechanisms to address the sharing of sensitive data<br>to a wider audience across the 5 Eyes Intelligence Community.<br>(TS//SI) There was a positive atmosphere from the start of the conference, with each agency<br>very willing to play a role in the success of the GNF. The GNF accepted the challenging<br>responsibility for developing the strategic vision for the 5 Eyes Intelligence Community across<br>Global Network accesses in accordance with the 5 Eyes SIGINT Business Vision (SIGINT<br>Strategic Action - Access). Initially, this will include COMSAT, Special Source and STATEROOM ,<br>and will cover:<br>cross-agency architectural and technical solutions (where appropriate),<br>Operational planning and Mission Management,<br>coherent SIGINT Development and<br>Sustained Collection.<br>The GNF will be led by a Senior Steering Group (SSG) consisting of the representative of each<br>agency attending the GNF as Head of Delegation.<br>(U//FOUO) Thanks to background work with the partners prior to the conference, several<br>agreements were reached and the first GNF was a great success. To maintain the impetus<br>generated at the inaugural forum, the next iteration of the GNF will be held at NSA in early<br>December 2004.
