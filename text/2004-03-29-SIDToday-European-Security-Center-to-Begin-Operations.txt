On 10 March, MG<br>Quirk (SID) and MG Kimmons of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM)<br>signed the Concept of Operations for the European Security Center (ESC), setting the stage for<br>an April start of formal SIGINT operations in Darmstadt, Germany. The ESC (USM-44) will<br>perform SIGINT operations primarily in support of U.S. Army Europe and the European<br>Command, but it will also conduct mutually beneficial, cooperative missions with various SID<br>Product Lines.<br> <br>(C) The ESC is a fixed site facility that will provide crisis support to military operations<br>throughout the European Command theater, which includes not only Europe, but also much of<br>Africa and parts of the Middle East. Working with a collocated INSCOM Theater SIGINT Battalion<br>(TSB), the ESC will also provide an on-demand survey capability and deploy tailored front-end<br>collection equipment. It will be a complete production facility, performing collection, processing,<br>analysis and dissemination.<br>(C) The Center will also support theater SIGINT soldiers assigned at tactical echelons. It will<br>serve both as a formal training center where those soldiers routinely train and maintain technical<br>and language skills, and as a deployment center for soldiers who directly support contingency<br>missions and combat operations.<br> <br>(C) The ESC is initially staffed by SIGINT soldiers of INSCOM's 66th Military Intelligence Group,<br>augmented by Army civilians and contractors. In the near term, they will be assisted by SID<br>augmentees who possess critical skills, with the appropriate level of long-term SID support to be<br>assessed as the ESC matures. Initially an "Army" organization, the ESC is a flexible construct<br>that could potentially host personnel and missions from other Services and Agencies.<br>(C) The ESC is housed in two new SCIF** structures (over 10,000 square feet) adjacent to an<br>existing Army Operations SCIF that houses other Army theater intelligence support missions,<br>allowing an enhanced all-source effort against theater requirements. Current ESC systems and<br>capabilities include 59 Distributed Common Ground Station - Army (DCGS-A) workstations,<br>HIGHCASTLE (for voice processing and analysis and reporting), the TROJAN CLASSIC XXI<br>collection, processing, analysis and reporting system, and an Emitter Mapping suite. Planned<br>reconfiguration includes a "Linguarium", a novel construct to consolidate, focus and enhance<br>voice analyst capabilities and productivity.<br>(U//FOUO) Army Points of Contact: <br>LTC <br>, Chief, Operations Division, Army Cryptologic Operations (<br>) <br>Mr. <br>, Chief, ACO Operations Field Support and European Desk Officer <br>)<br>(U//FOUO) SID Points of Contact: <br>Mr.<br>Chief Technical Support Program Management Office (TSPMO)<br><br>@nsa,<br>@nsa,<br><br>@nsa, <br><br> </p>Mr. <br><br>, Deputy Chief TSPMO <br><br>@nsa,<br><br>**SCIF=Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
