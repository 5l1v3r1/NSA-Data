(Part 1)<br>FROM:<br>Chief, Reporting Board (S12A)<br>Run Date: 03/09/2004<br>FROM: <br> <br>Chief, Reporting Board (S12A) <br>(U//FOUO) Over the last year, through feedback from analysts and customers, we learned that<br>the current processes for gathering and responding to customer requests for SIGINT products<br>and services are not meeting their needs. They can be difficult to use and are inadequate to<br>handle the workload and workflow. These findings were confirmed by outside consultants. Some<br>initial approaches to remedy the situation were undertaken but did not really address the<br>fundamental issue - NSA does not have an integrated process to gather, track and respond to<br>customer requests .<br>(U//FOUO) This showed itself in many ways. For example, customer requests for information<br>coming through NSA's front door are often divorced from the production cycle. Further, there is<br>no common language within NSA or externally to refer to customers, countries, subjects, etc. As<br>cottage industry solutions became as numerous as the symptoms, we recognized the need for<br>an overall solution.<br>(U//FOUO) In late summer 2003, the Chief of the Customer Relationships Directorate<br>established the Customer Information Needs Response Integrated Process Team (CINR<br>IPT). The CINR was charged with developing and implementing a streamlined and seamless<br>process whereby the customer can submit requests for SIGINT products and services and SID<br>can effectively and efficiently respond. The CINR IPT comprises representatives from Customer<br>Relationships, Analysis and Production, Data Acquisition, SIRVES and IAD. The team's Concept<br>of Operation describes the goals, objectives, and the "to-be" state. See also the CINR<br>Storyboard .<br>(U//FOUO) The overall objectives are to enable our external customers to enter their requests in<br>a logical, categorized fashion and allow tracking of the request throughout the process - from<br>submission, through processing, to delivery and feedback. We also want to ensure that our<br>internal workforce can easily view relevant requests, respond quickly, collaborate easily, and<br>accurately assess our response to the customer. We envision a process similar to that used by<br>any number of commercial organizations whereby a customer can submit an order for goods or<br>services, track the status of their order, and provide feedback. In turn, the organization can<br>manage its inventory and adjust processes to ensure customer satisfaction. Our goal is to<br>provide NSA customers visibility into our products and services with the ability to:<br>browse, much like our current Intelink capability<br>see the status of their requests and currently available products<br>submit requests and/or subscribe to products and services<br>update their profiles and<br>request help<br>Internally, NSA analysts and managers will have a standard workflow to view and track the<br>actions and data flows in response to requests from the customer order entry through the<br>SIGINT production cycle using a common structure. The new process will facilitate automating<br>distributions, TAGs, and INs, relieving analysts from manually inputting these items. The end-toend tracking will provide improved collection and analysis of metrics to help steer production<br>and manage critical resources.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U//FOUO) Watch for part 2 of this article to find out what the CINR IPT is doing to achieve<br>these goals.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
