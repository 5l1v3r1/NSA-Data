Do you also know that SCS helps protect top-level U.S. officials when<br>they travel overseas? One of SCS's duties is to assist in Executive Protection, working directly<br>with U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and local CIA Station personnel to provide tactical local support.<br>(S//SI) Executive Protection Operations, also known as close support, is the number one priority<br>for the SCS Special Operations Division (SOD). SCS was formally tasked to provide "real-time"<br>SIGINT support for USSS Executive Protection of the President of the United States (POTUS) and<br>the Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS) in July 1979. SOD responds to close support<br>requirements levied by the U.S. Secret Service whenever these or (occasionally) other U.S.<br>officials travel abroad. If the VIP is traveling to an area where there is a permanent SCS site,<br>that site is tasked to provide close support. If there is no permanent SCS site, SOD deploys a<br>three to five person team to the location, usually several days in advance of the VIP's travel<br>date.<br>(S//SI) SCS typically supports anywhere from 10 to 15 Executive Protection missions a year;<br>however this can vary depending on world events. In early 2002, SCS supported unprecedented<br>back-to-back VPOTUS and POTUS trips involving twenty stops and requiring support from twelve<br>SCS fixed sites and eight SOD-deployed close support teams.<br>(S//SI//REL) Close support teams scan the VHF/UHF spectrum for indications of threat activity<br>against the VIP or host government, movements or activities of known terrorists in the host<br>country, and demonstrations or potential riots. They also conduct sustained monitoring of host<br>government security services, police communications and airport frequencies. The equipment<br>suite used by SOD deployed teams is capable of monitoring and recording the RF range of<br>20Mhz to 1Ghz. It consists of an integrated receiver/processing platform capable of monitoring<br>UHF/VHF PTT and cellular communications.<br>(S//SI//REL) The teams activate 24-hour coverage prior to the arrival of the VIP and remain<br>operational until the protectee departs. Close support operations are normally staged out of the<br>U.S. Embassy, Consulate or from a hotel room in close proximity to the VIP or venue. SCS<br>works closely with Secret Service Intelligence Division (ID) Special Agents (SA) who maintain a<br>24-hour presence in the SCS workroom and have an ID SA lead with the protective detail that<br>escorts the VIP. Any threat-related SIGINT that impacts on the executive is immediately passed<br>to the on-site USSS agent and to NSA.<br>(TS//SI//REL) On a number of occasions, host-country officials have been aware of threatrelated incidents and for whatever reason have been unwilling to share that information with the<br>Secret Service protective details. SCS close support operations have successfully intercepted<br>these types of communications on multiple occasions and tipped the USSS ID Special Agents.<br>During the 1996 APEC Summit in Manila, for example, SCS intercepted Philippine police<br>communications discussing a bomb located on a bridge in Former POTUS Clinton's motorcade<br>route. Local authorities were attempting to quietly dismantle the bomb without notifying USSS.<br>As a result of SCS close support, Secret Service was able to divert the motorcade to an<br>alternative route. Similar adjustments have resulted from close support intercepts discussing<br>local demonstrations and other potential incidents.<br>(S//SI) SCS/SOD continues to work to improve its support to the Secret Service's protective<br>mission. Recently, it established standard procedures with the White House Communications<br>Agency (WHCA) for shipping and storing collection equipment when SOD is deploying to<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">locations where no U.S. embassy or consulate exist or when time constraints preclude diplomatic<br>pouching. In order to provide better real-time SIGINT support, SOD is exploring opportunities to<br>increase bandwidth to the close support operations, possibly through WHCA resources, to enable<br>collection and processing of GSM cellular communications in the field.<br>(S//SI) In addition, SOD and Secret Service ID have made significant steps to expand secure<br>communications both in the field and back to headquarters. Secure wireless phones and STEs<br>(Secure Terminal Equipment) allow all concerned ID agents - those working in the SCS work<br>room, the ID lead with the protectee, and the ID Fusion Center at USSS Headquarters -- to<br>communicate securely with each other. Most recently, SCS/SOD has established secure VoIP<br>connectivity between the USSS ID Fusion Center and three SCS sites in Greece in support of<br>executive protection for Former POTUS Bush who, along with over two-dozen family members,<br>will be attending the summer Olympics.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
