TAWDRYYARD

ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) Beacon RF retro-reflector. Provides return
when illuminated with radar to provide rough positional location.

(U) Capabilities

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) TAWDRYYARD is
used as a beacon, typically to assist in locating
and identifying deployed RAGEMASTER units.
Current design allows it to be detected and located
quite easily within a 50' radius of the radar system
being used to illuminate it. TAWDRYYARD draws
as 8 pA at 2.5V (20pW) allowing a standard lithium
coin cell to power it for months or years. The
simplicity of the design allows the form factor to
be tailored for specific operational requirements.
Future capabilities being considered are return of
GPS coordinates and a unique target identifier and
automatic processing to scan a target area for
presence of TAWDRYYARDs. All components are
COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TS//SI//REL TO USA.FVEY) The board generates a square wave operating
at a preset frequency. This square wave is used to turn a FET (field effect
transistor) on and off. When the unit is illuminated with a CW signal, the
illuminating signal is amplitude-modulated (AM) with the square wave. This
signal is re-radiated, where it is picked up by the radar, then processed to
recover the clock signal. Typically, the fundamental is used to indicate the
unit's presence, and is simply displayed on a low frequency spectrum
analyzer. TAWDRYYARD is part of the ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar
retro-reflectors.
