DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) Translators for Hire<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications (S02C)<br>Run Date: 09/29/2004<br><br>(U) There's a new acronym floating around the Intelligence Community: NVTC.<br>Have you heard of it? The National Virtual Translation Center , established in<br>February of 2003, serves as a clearinghouse for interagency use of translators.<br>There are fifteen different IC agencies enjoying the services of the NVTC -- and due to the<br>recent emergence of a finalized policy, NSA is now one of them!<br>(U) So the obvious question is: Why do we need the NVTC when the Intelligence Community<br>already employs translators? The answer is that the members of the IC are faced with an<br>overwhelming volume of material requiring translation, some of which is in uncommon<br>languages or dialects. The NVTC was not designed to replace the foreign language translation<br>efforts of existing agencies, but rather to augment and supplement those capabilities.<br>(U) The NVTC hires government employees, academics, and people from the private sector to<br>translate government documents on a full-time, part-time, and contractual basis. They also<br>employ linguists who are military reservists (their work on behalf of NVTC counts towards their<br>reserve duties) and students at the Defense Language Institute in California. The NVTC provides<br>competitive rates of $26-$38 an hour depending on the language. They recruit linguists via<br>advertisements in U.S. newspapers, publicity on radio and television, etc.<br>(U//FOUO) While the center itself is located in Washington, DC, the majority of the center's<br>work is completed in the field. First, client agencies send their untranslated documents to the<br>NVTC, which provides an estimate on what the translation job will cost. (Very short translation<br>jobs are done for free.) Once the estimate has been accepted, the job is farmed out to linguists<br>wherever they may be in the country. The linguists are not told where the documents originated<br>or which agency is the client. Linguists who work on classified materials (as high as TS//SI)<br>receive their assignments via secure channels in NVTC branch offices or other government<br>facilities. For unclassified projects, linguists are able to work from home.<br>(U//FOUO) All translations undergo quality control before release to the client. For example,<br>documents in Russian are checked by the same level 4-5 linguists who support the "hotline"<br>between Moscow and Washington!<br>(U//FOUO) As noted above, SID has a newly established policy on how it will interact with the<br>NVTC. See this document (SID Management Directive Number 408) at this URL:<br><br>(U) In part two of this article (coming soon), we will interview Everette Jordan, the NVTC<br>director.<br>(U) For more information on the NVTC, see its Internet web page at: http://www.nvtc.gov.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br><br> </p>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
