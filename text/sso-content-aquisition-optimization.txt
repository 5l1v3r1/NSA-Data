Yahoo Webmessenger

•	Update data sent to individuals logged into Yahoo's Instant
Messenger service online

-	Online contact status, unread emails in Yahoo inbox

-	Usually small sessions (2-4kB)

•	Sporadic collection (30,000 - 60,000 sessions per day)

•	Intermittent bursts of collection against contacts of targets

-	Large numbers of sessions (20,000+) against a single targeted selector

-	Not collected against the target (online presence/unread email from target)

-	No owner attribution (metadata value limited to fact-of comms for emails,
online presence events for buddies)

•	Over a dozen selectors detasked in two weeks

-	Because a target's contact was using/idling on Yahoo Webmessenger

-	Several very timely selectors (Libyan transition, Greek financial related)

Address Books

•	Email address books for most major webmail are collected as
stand-alone sessions (no content present*)

•	Address books are repetitive, large, and metadata-rich

•	Data is stored multiple times (marina/mainway, pinwale, clouds)

•	Fewer and fewer address books attributable to users, targets

•	Address books account for ~ 22% of SSO's major accesses (up
from ~ 12% in August)

Buddy Lists,Inboxes

• Unlike address books, frequently contain content data

-	Offline messages, buddy icon updates, other data included

-	Webmail inboxes increasingly include email content

-	Most collection is due to the presence of a target on a buddy list where the
communication is not to, from, or about that target

• NSA collects, on a representative day, ~ 500,000 buddylists and
inboxes

- More than 90% collected because tasked selectors identified only as
contacts (not communicant, content, or owner)

• Identifying buddylists and inboxes without content (or without
useful content) an ongoing challenge

Scenario:

@yahoo

* I Sep 2011^^^^^^^^|@yahoo.com (tasked S2E, asw
Iran Quds Force) has his/her Yahoo account hacked by an
unknown actor, sends out spam email to his/her contact list:

TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN

Scenario:

@yahoo

@yahoo.com has a number of Yahoo groups in his/her
contact list, some with many hundreds or thousands of
members



At DS-200B in particular, collection spiked as:

-	The initial spam messages were sent (and collected)

-	Inboxes of email recipients were viewed by	contact list

-	Messages were sometimes viewed, but more often sent as precached
views on Google and Yahoo (along with inboxes)

- Inboxes where the recipient did not delete the spam message continued to
be collected every time they were viewed

- Some recipients added

@yahoo.com to their address books

(possibly as a spam defeat?) - address books were collected every time

Scenario:

@yahoo.com emergency detasked from DS-200B and
US-3171 at 13:04Z on 20 Oct

•	Numerous first-order address books and inboxes collected

meant tasked selectors on address books or buddy lists of
contacts of |	@yahoo.com also affected:

-	@yahoo.com and ^^^^^^|@gmail.com emergency
detasked off US-3171 at 13:10Z on 20 Sep

•	Memorializing to PINWALE only address books and inboxes
owned by target selectors would have reduced PINWALE
volumes 90%+

-	Site XKEYSCOREs would buffer data for SIGDEV purposes

-	Metadata from known owner address books and inboxes stored regardless

Mobile IMAP

•	IMAP protocol used by email clients
to fetch mail from server(s)

•	Not designed for devices with
intermittent connections (i.e. mobile
phones)

•	Android implementation in
particular uses a lot of bandwidth
