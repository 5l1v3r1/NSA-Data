Little did this terrorist know that NSA<br>knew his login name and that Counterterrorism analysts were alerted to his traffic.<br>Unfortunately, the analysts were unable to do much with it, as the target never talked to anyone<br>and he had few names on his buddy list.<br>(S//SI) The analysts wanted to look at all of the traffic generated by the terrorist but were<br>unable to do so... The web cafÃ© used an inexpensive device known as a Network Address<br>Translator (NAT) to share the Internet connection to all the computers in the cafÃ©. There were<br>many people in the cafÃ© and the NAT mixed the computer sessions from all of the users<br>together. Luckily, a fledgling service known as DISTANTFISH had just been deployed to Menwith<br>Hill Station, and this new system was able to find the desired terrorist traffic.<br>(S//SI) Project DISTANTFISH was created to target terrorist traffic on the Internet by providing<br>two important services. First, it provides a database for discovering account identities for known<br>terrorists to use as strong selectors (i.e. login names, e-mail addresses, or other elements that<br>can be associated with a particular individual). Second, it provides information on which the<br>same user generated computer sessions. Thus, if one session contains a strong selector for a<br>terrorist, then all sessions can be collected. At the heart of this capability is an association<br>service that can track an individual computer by the way it generates packets.<br>(S//SI) From this association service, the DISTANTFISH team members were able to determine<br>that the terrorist generated 107 computer sessions over eleven minutes, thus separating this<br>traffic from that of the other 16 people in the web cafÃ©. As most of the supporting software is<br>still under development, the data was manually examined resulting in the discovery of two<br>additional MSN Messenger accounts and two Yahoo web mail accounts that the terrorist used,<br>but that NSA had been unaware of. Since terrorists often abandon accounts for new ones,<br>having a complete picture of the accounts used is critical for targeting the terrorists' traffic.<br>(U) Transforming DNI Selection and Filtering<br>(S//SI) The need to greatly expand the existing DNI Surgical Survey capability has been<br>recognized by Data Acquisition and Analysis and Production, placing this task on a list of twelve<br>critical hard DNI problems known as the DA Dozen. The proposed solution is referred to as<br>Persona Session Collection (PSC) and, to work, relies on strong selectors and user session<br>association. DISTANTFISH provides critical capability on both and was highlighted as an<br>important component to transforming DNI selection and filtering.<br>(S//SI) PSC works by processing application layer protocols to extract certain metadata fields<br>that work as strong selectors for the client of the current application. These selectors are usually<br>login names, client e-mail addresses, user numbers, and other unique metadata. If a selector is<br>found to be that of a known terrorist, that session, as well as all others generated by the<br>terrorist, is forwarded to NSA for analysis. The DISTANTFISH association algorithms are the<br>primary way of determining which sessions the terrorist generated when the access is traditional<br>passive collection. The collection of all user sessions is called the Aggregate Session and can be<br>achieved by other methods, especially active efforts.<br>(S//SI) However, PSC assumes that the strong selectors for a terrorist are known. The second<br>objective for DISTANTFISH is to associate all strong selectors for SIGINT targets and store them<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">in a database. Intelligence analysts use the database to discover new identities to add to the<br>selectors for that terrorist. Work on this database has begun, but much work remains.<br>(U) Moving Forward<br>(S//SI) Menwith Hill Station has over fifty hits a day on known terrorists accounts. This success<br>has accelerated the work on the DISTANTFISH identity database and on integrating the<br>association information into sustained processing systems. In the coming months, traffic related<br>to all hits will be associated and presented to analysts together. The terrorist identity discovery<br>database being developed in the Target Analysis Cell (TAC/TDS) will also come on line. When<br>that day comes, terrorists will find it difficult to blend in to the crowd, allowing NSA and US<br>troops to target terrorists before they can target us.<br>(U) More Information<br>(U//FOUO) DISTANTFISH Project Webpage<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
