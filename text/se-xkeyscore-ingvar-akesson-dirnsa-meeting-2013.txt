COMMON THREADS:
I TO USA, SWE) Emphasize the value ofthe NSA-FRA partnership.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
USA, SWE) Recommend General Alexander and DKDIR emphasize the following
points:

Quantum Operations:

II (TSHSIHREL TO USA, SWE) Acknowledge the success that NSA, FRA, and GCHQ
have had on WINTERLIGHT. Last month, we received a message from our Swedish
partner that GCHQ received FRA QUANTUM tips that led to 100 shots, five of which
were successfully redirected to the GCHQ server. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)
con?rmed with Tailored Access Operations (TAO) that this validates the "proof of
concept" that was originally trying to be accomplished. Additionally, FAD, TAO, and
Enterprise Information Technology Services are still working through the technical
solution to have FRA tip directly to NSA. S3 Data Acquisitions? goal is to have a
solution for a direct tip to RA operational by this summer. The Quantum effort
motivated the recent XKEYSCORE installation. RA is currently evaluating it for use to
support their SIGINT Development work.

Cable Aecesszeporting and Analysis:

TO USA, SWE) Highlight that would like to continue to
collaborate on cable access program, which has resulted in unique SIGINT
reporting on a variety of high-priority SIGINT topics (123 reports thus far this ?scal
year). FRA continues to gain access to more data from additional telecommunications
companies, making the cable access potentially lucrative for for targets beyond
Russia.

TOP 

(TSIIREL TO USA, SWE) Stress that NTOC is ready to seriously engage with FRA on
cyber defense. Mr. kesson has reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

and has no changes; therefore, we would like to have an official signing during the
24 April I 130?1200 discussions.

NTOC shared some information with FRA about a Swedish intrusion in
November 2012. RA came in with questions in February 2013 that led NTOC to do
more analysis. Subsequently, NTOC reached the same conclusion as FRA, that it
involved the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. RA asked if it could alert Israel and NTOC
agreed that it could tell Israel about the intrusion. Israel?s identity was never
compromised.

VTC Capability

TO USA, FVEY) Encourage FRA to set up its equipment soonest to allow for
secure VTC capability. That capability already exists with Norway and Denmark and has
shown bene?t in expanding analytic collaboration on a myriad of issues. FRA's
technology directorate is just waiting on requirements from its SIGINT directorate to be
able to ?nalize the set-up and installation.

Counterterrorism:

TO USA, SWE) Counterterrorism (CT) and FRA
continue to cooperate and collaborate on CT threat-related activities in Europe. Several
analyst-to-analyst meetings have taken place and European Center (ECC) in
Darmstadt, Germany, is formally coordinating a Staff Processing Form (SPF) to have
Sweden assist with high-priority CT Swedish language traf?c that ECC is
currently unable to fully analyze. In January 2013, CT established its first CT deployed
analyst position in Stockholm. Also in January, FRA and SAPO were legally allowed to
collaborate after a 4-year hiatus.

TO USA, SWE) Encourage increased collaboration on CT threat streams.

Russia:

TO USA, SWE) Thank Sweden for its continued work on the Russian
target, and underscore the primary role that FRA plays as a leading partner to work the
Russian target, including Russian leadership, energy, and and
counterintelligence. cable access has resulted in unique SIGINT reporting on all
of these areas.

TO USA, SWE) Encourage continued collaboration and sharing of reporting
on Russian topics.
