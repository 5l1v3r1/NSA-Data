Software Reverse Engineering

Network Defence performs reverse engineering both of malicious and of non-
malicious code - i.e,.code is translated from machine-readable to human-readable
form so that its functions and vulnerabilities can be analysed more easily. Analysis of
non-malicious code is undertaken for two main reasons - to establish the
vulnerability of Operating Systems and applications to electronic attack, and to
authenticate the claims made for security-related products and their general
suitability for HMG use. All this knowledge informs CESG’s advice to HMG on
electronic attack.

Network Defence’s SRE work is mainly in support of the Response and IA teams, but
occasionally for other parts of GCHQ and external customers. Within ND, both the
VR and the ID teams perform SRE work.

Sources: where does the material come from?

Malicious code is acquired via various routes - HARUSPEX/GORDIAN KNOT,
OGDs, commercial organisations.

Non-malicious code is acquired through normal commercial channels.

Legal Authorities

Reverse engineering of malicious code does not require a warrant, because there is
no agreement with the author that would be breached by carrying out that activity.

However, reverse engineering of commercial products needs to be warranted in
order to be lawful. Network Defence may rely on GCHQ’s SRE warrant (GPW/1160,
renewable every 6 months). There are some limitations to this warrant - it only
covers us under UK law, for example, and it only authorises work conducted for a
SIGIN^MM>urpose. The authorisation for ND’s SRE work has been discussed with
the SRE co-ordinator for CCNE.

forms for commercial SRE work under this warrant are signed by
5 ID team) or by one of a list of named individuals (for the VR
team). Because it is hard for the ID team to predict which products it may have to
reverse engineer, and such work may need to be authorised at short notice, ID team
SRE work is authorised en masse on a yearly basis. Who approved this
arrangement?

Input from VR/ID is required every 6 months to support GCHQ’s SRE warrant
renewal. This can be based on the local authorisation forms for that period.

Note: Until Feb 08 the ID team were not following the internal authorisation
procedure. This error was reported on 29/0/08 and has now been corrected. SRE
performed by the ID team before that date has been authorised retrospectively.
