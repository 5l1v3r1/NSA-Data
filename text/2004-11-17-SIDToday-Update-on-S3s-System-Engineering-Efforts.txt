DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(S//SI) Update on S3's System Engineering Efforts<br>FROM: <br>Technical Director, SID Systems Engineering Office (S01A)<br>Run Date: 11/17/2004<br><br>(S//SI) I'd like to update you on Data Acquisition's (S3) efforts to strengthen the management<br>of our Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) activities. As mentioned in an August SID today article<br>, S3 asked me to advise them on systems engineering issues that arise as we endeavor to add<br>functionality and connectedness to an already complex system. My role in this regard is to<br>ensure the improvements we make are done in such a way that they will "fit into NSA's<br>transformational programs."<br>(S//SI) Many key initiatives are coming together, calling for us to use good system engineering<br>and program management practices to produce well-defined system interfaces. These include<br>activities associated with:<br>Access and Collection,<br>Processing and Exploitation,<br>Filtering and Selection,<br>Selector Management,<br>Data Storage,<br>Automated Data Manipulation and<br>Presentation services.<br>(S//SI) First, we met with representatives throughout SID to better understand the challenges<br>associated with the exploitation of DNI and to discover ways to respond effectively to those<br>challenges. As mentioned in the August note, TRAFFICTHIEF , Global Newtwork Development<br>Activity (GNDA), CES's WEALTHYCLUSTER program, Persona Session Collection, Strong Selector<br>Management, Unified Targeting Tool and Metadata Strategy are good examples of the ongoing<br>activities meant to improve our ability to exploit DNI on a global scale.<br>(S//SI) Additionally, we just had our first review with S3 leadership where we've started to<br>identify key issues and gaps. Next steps include the identification of the programmatic<br>boundaries and dependencies between these key initiatives, which will be discussed in a future<br>update.
