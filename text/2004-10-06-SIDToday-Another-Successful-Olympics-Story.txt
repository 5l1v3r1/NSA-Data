The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center<br>(CSRC) Olympics Strategists worked with people and organizations from across the Extended<br>Enterprise to create a SIGINT Campaign Strategy focusing on support to the Games. Unlike the<br>athletes, when the Olympics are over, the NSA team is hoping you won't even know they were<br>there. Instead of Olympic gold, their goal was making sure the Olympics proceeded without<br>terrorist incident and that the approximately 10,500 athletes from over 200 countries, millions<br>of fans, and the international press could focus on the sporting events in the Olympic spirit of<br>peaceful competition.<br> <br>(S//SI) Starting in 2002, CSRC Strategists, <br>, <br> <br> and <br>, worked with Customer Relations Division (CRD) and external customers to<br>document previously unstated Information Needs. Teaming with SIGDEV and Analysis and<br>Production (A&amp;P) to ensure that an analytic attack was in place and that targets' social networks<br>were defined, these strategists examined the evolving communications network being built for<br>the Games, determined gaps in SIGINT access, and directed fielding of collection and forwarding<br>systems. And all this was before the torch was lit signifying the Opening of the Games of the<br>XXVIII Olympiad. In short, the team followed the SID Operating Principles to systematically<br>analyze what our customers needed and planned how the SIGINT system would meet those<br>needs.<br>(S//SI) When the plan went into the implementation phase, the CSRC monitored the effort. This<br>was simplified through the use of an Info Work Space (IWS) virtual room dedicated to the<br>Games, which allowed Intelligence Community professionals from across the Extended<br>Enterprise, including Denver, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) 24/7 multiINT Olympic watch, NSAW, and those deployed in Athens itself, to coordinate operations<br>smoothly.<br>(TS//SI) Given the broad scope of the Games, all DA Groups played a part in improving access,<br>collection, and forwarding of traffic. For example, prior to the start of the Olympics:<br>Commercial Technologies Group worked with vendors to learn about communications<br>being installed to support the Olympics;<br>CSRC gathered data from CIA documenting the GSM networks active in Athens;<br>Special Source Operations improved mid-point cable access to DNI and voice targets in<br>Greece;<br>SCS Athens fielded additional capabilities to bring traffic back to NSAW;<br>Tailored Access Operations performed CNE operations against Greek communications<br>providers.<br>Additional support during the Games included fielding three remote collection teams (one each<br>from Link Access, Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services, and the SCS) active in the Athens<br>area to fill collection gaps.<br>(S//SI) After this year's gold medal performance, what comes next? Well, the CSRC started<br>looking into the issues of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy months ago.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
