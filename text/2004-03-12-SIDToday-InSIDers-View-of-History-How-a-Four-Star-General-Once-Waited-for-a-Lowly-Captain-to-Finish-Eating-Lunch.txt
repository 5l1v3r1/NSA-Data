In that role I had the privilege to fly a number of<br>interesting individuals in the political/military hierarchy during the<br>Carter Administration. Two of the names in the President's inner<br>circle that may still ring a bell were Ms Lillian Carter and Zbigniew<br>Brzezinski.<br>(U) Other passengers who flew aboard my aircraft during that time<br>period included Lt General Tom Stafford (commander of the Apollo<br>Soyuz Space Mission), numerous senators and congressmen as well<br>as one former NSA Director. This leads me to my story about how a<br>Four Star General once waited for a lowly Captain to finish eating<br>lunch.<br>(U) On that occasion, I was flying General Lew Allen from Andrews<br>to Edwards Air Force Base in California. General Allen was<br>Commander of Air Force Systems Command at the time. His wife<br>was traveling with him to Edwards. We had to stop for refueling at<br>Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha. The General stated that he was in<br>a bit of a hurry to get to Edwards. I radioed ahead to ask for a<br>quick refuel and was told that Base Operations would do what they<br>could. On arrival at Offutt I was told it would take about twenty<br>minutes to refuel the aircraft. I advised the General of this fact and<br>told him that the both the copilot and I would check the enroute<br>weather at Base Operations (within a short walking distance) and<br>advised him that he and his wife might like to make use of the<br>facilities. Our CT-39, Sabreliner, had little or nothing on board in<br>the way of amenities.<br>(U) After a quick check of the weather and our own use of the<br>restrooms, the copilot returned to the aircraft and I entered the<br>Base Operations Snack Bar in an attempt to quickly consume part<br>of my Air Force Issue box lunch. After just one bite of my<br>sandwich, the Transient Maintenance Crew Chief approached me.<br>He said that they had expedited our refueling and the aircraft was<br>now ready to go. Both General Allen and his wife were nearby and<br>observed the exchange. The General's wife then said "Finish your<br>lunch Captain, we can stand to wait a few extra minutes. And don't<br>rush yourself. We wouldn't want you to get indigestion." I looked<br>at the General who just shrugged his shoulders slightly and turned<br>away. And so it was that I ate my lunch (quickly, of course, but<br>without obvious haste), while a Four Star General and his wife<br>waited.<br>(U) The year was 1979. General Allen was DIRNSA from August<br>1973-77. Little did I know I would be working here myself about<br>eight years later.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) InSIDer's View of<br>History '04 <br>1.
