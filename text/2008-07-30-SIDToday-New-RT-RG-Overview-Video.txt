(U) New RT-RG Overview Video Available on NSANet

FROM:

Corporate Communications, Meade Operations Center (F74)
Run Date: 07/30/2008

(U//FOUO) If you have heard of the Real-Time Regional
Gateway (RT-RG) initiative and want to learn more about it,
you are in luck! The Meade Operations Center Dragon

TAMERS have created a 10-minute overview video that is available on your desktop. The video
outlines RT-RG's goals, capabilities, and benefits. It was created in response to the intense
community-wide interest in the RT-RG tool suite and high demand for briefings and
demonstrations of the tools and their application.

(U//FOUO) Now personnel throughout the Enterprise can access this information at their
convenience, and refer back to it as needed. The video can also serve as a preparation for NETA-
2014 ("RT-RG Tool Suite for GSM Analysis"), to help students gain a context for what they will
learn in class.

(U//FOUO) For those who require more in-depth knowledge, the Dragon TAMERS have training
videos for several of the RT-RG tools (GEO-T, Goldminer, SharkFinn, and SORTINGLEAD). These
videos can provide review and reinforcement following NETA-2014, or serve as initial training on
the tool suite.

(U) A Brief Summary

(S//REL) RT-RG, formerly called RT-10, is a suite of tools that provides the forward-deployed
analyst access to near-real-time metadata and reporting to better support the tactical customer.
The tools are web-based for easy access, employ the "find-fix-finish" concept of honing in on a
target, and are exponentially faster than traditional analytic tools, enabling expeditionary
cryptologists to provide useful products to the customer within a commander's decision cycle.
The Dragon TAMERS team is an operational test bed for RT-RG tools, providing valuable
feedback to the software developers and training analysts throughout the Enterprise in their use.

(U) Recent Initiatives

•	(S//SI//REL) RT-RG is now operational in Afghanistan. VOICESAIL and GSM collection is
getting into both theatres' servers, and developers are currently working on models to
include push-to-talk radio collection in the Afghanistan system.

•	(TS//SI//REL) Additional tools have been developed, and improvements have been made
to existing tools -- e.g., SORTINGLEAD has increased functionality for DTMF (dual-tone
multiple frequency) analysis.

•	(S//SI//REL) VoiceRT* upgrades include DTMF tipping, automatic tipping of specified
terms of interest, and speaker identification, which will soon be able to find new voice
cuts for a target that match the target's past recordings.

•	(U) RT-RG training has been formalized in NETA-2014, and students will receive National
Cryptologic School credit for completing this course.

Does the mOc Contribute to RT10? .

(U) Notes:

* (S//SI//REL) VoiceRT indexes, tags, and searches intercepted voice to enable analysts to find
relevant cuts and sort through much larger amounts of traffic based on content.
