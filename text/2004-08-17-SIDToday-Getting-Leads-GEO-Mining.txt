Its goal is to give SIGINT analysts useful tools<br>to help them get new and profitable lead information on their targets. The way it works is this:<br>first, analysts establish a profile to narrow down the type of call events that are of interest. For<br>example, they may be interested in calls that were made in a certain region at a particular time.<br>Next, GEO Mining's algorithm mathematically enhances the profile and sifts through NSA's<br>databases to isolate those call events that appear most promising as target leads. These leads<br>are then passed to the analysts for follow-up investigation.<br>(TS//SI) As part of GEO Mining's development, several tests have been conducted. In one case,<br>the objective was to find new heroin-processing labs in Afghanistan and the associated PCS<br>(Personal Communications Service) handsets. Since there are about 97,000 locatable call events<br>in Afghanistan on any given day, GEO Mining's task was to winnow this down to a manageable<br>number of leads. With the help of the South West Asia Narcotics (SWAN) team (S2F11), a<br>profile was created to include only the calls that were made near 27 known heroin-processing<br>labs in the country. When run against the available metadata, the program produced a list of the<br>handsets that were used in the targeted area. The top 20 handsets were then tasked for<br>collection, and at least one has produced reportable intelligence. In addition, a map of potential<br>new drug labs was sent to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which confirmed<br>that the suspected sites were indeed labs.<br>(U/FOUO) Geo Mining aims to create a suite of tools to routinely give SIGINT developers and<br>analysts lead information of this kind. The cross-organizational team consists of members from<br>SID/Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES - S31), the NSA/Research Associate<br>Directorate (RAD), the GEO Cell (S2L), and the Cryptologic Mathematician Program (S3T2).<br>(U//FOUO) Are you interested in joining the GEO Mining team?
