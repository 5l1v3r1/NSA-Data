(U) Overview

(TS//SI//REL) SCARLETFEVER is the second LONGHAUL capability. It is a
message driven cryptologic exploitation service for DNSC traffic. Currently, the
list of SCARLETFEVER clients includes TURMOIL, WEALTHYCLUSTER and the
TEe. Each client can connect to SCARLETFEVER using ISLANDTRANSPORT.
Once connected, clients send and receive XML messages encrypted using
ISLANDHIDEAWAY.

An in depth look at SCARLETFEVER can be found here.

(U) Development Process and Standards

(U) History

■	(TS//SI//REL) The SCARLETFEVER development started in July 2009.

■	(TS//SI//REL) The basic high level functional design was completed in
early September 2009.

(U) Design

(TS//SI//REL) The SCARLETFEVER team then met several times over the
July-September time frame to refine the design of the system. The output of
those meetings was a series of BPMN diagrams and technology areas for
further investigation. The BPMN diagrams exposed:

■	The flow of information through the system (messages).

■	The high level components and critical elements.

(TS//SI//REL) The messages, component and critical elements, and technology
areas were used to generate an initial list of Engineering Change Requests
(ECRs) for further refinement and development.

(TS//SI//REL) SCARLETFEVER also has a geographically distributed
architecture concept which is currently being fleshed out. Why is this being
pursued?

■	Resume session pairing generates the bulk of the load. If this processing
can be shifted to the edge, then:

■	Less total aggregated network traffic due to collaboration with the
core

■	Less aggregate memory requirements at any one location

■	Redundant capabilities for better total mission survivability
