DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) 'Dropping Anchor' in Anchorage (repost)<br>FROM: <br>NSA/CSS NORAD/NORTHCOM Alaska Representative (NCNAR)<br>Run Date: 12/30/2004<br><br>, the NSA Representative in Alaska, works at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage.<br>He describes what life is like in the region... This article appeared on November 4th. (U//FOUO)<br>(U) Alaska or "Alyeska" stems from an Aleut word that means "The Great Land," a very<br>appropriate name. The state comprises about 1/5th the territory of the United States, has five<br>times the coastline of the "Lower 48," and prior to the Alaska Territory gaining statehood in<br>1959, many wanted to create two states -- just so Texas would be the third-largest state. Every<br>day when the tide (second-highest in the world) goes out, Alaska gains more landmass than the<br>state of Texas. A map of Alaska overlaid on the Lower 48 shows extremities spanning from coast<br>to coast -- Ketchikan aligns with Savannah, Anchorage aligns with Kansas City, and Shemya<br>aligns with Los Angeles.<br>(U) In 1935, aviation pioneer Gen Billy Mitchell testified before Congress that "Alaska is the<br>most central place in the world for aircraft, and that is true either for Europe, Asia, or North<br>America. I believe in the future, that he who holds Alaska will hold the world, and I think it is the<br>most important strategic place in the world." Several cargo carriers already have created hubs<br>at Anchorage's Ted Stevens International Airport for just that reason -- to take advantage of<br>short polar routes to other areas of the world.<br>(U) Areas such as San Diego and Norfolk can have noticeably good relations with large, nearby<br>military installations, but nowhere is solid military/civilian synergy more manifest than<br>throughout Alaska. Notwithstanding the gold rush, the territory was largely developed by the<br>military, and cementing the foundation was the buy-in from the native Alaskans who first acted<br>as scouts after the Japanese invasion of the Aleutians during WWII. Natives later became<br>members of the National Guard, and today constitute a good share of those positions in the bush<br>("not serviced by roads"). About one in five Alaskans throughout the state has some affiliation<br>with the military -- that figure becomes about one in three in Anchorage.<br>(U) Anchorage is located in what is referred to as the "Anchorage Bowl" because of the<br>protection afforded by the Chugach Mts., the Alaska Range, and the warm Japanese Current,<br>which provide the milder climate for Alaska's "banana belt." Rich alluvial soil and long hours of<br>summer sunlight produce world-record flowers and vegetables -- this year's Alaska State Fair<br>featured a 707-lb pumpkin. Temperatures range from the 80s to the minus 30s - but not for<br>protracted periods. I've been colder in 35 degrees in Seattle than in 20 below here. Pick a<br>subject. Sunrise, sunset, Aurora Borealis, lakes, mountains, rivers, glaciers, wildlife, quality of<br>life issues, and friendly people -- when someone in a store offers to help, and he doesn't even<br>work there, you know you are in Alaska.<br> <br>(U) Outdoors takes on a new meaning in Alaska because there is so much of it -- flying in,<br>passengers cross hundreds of miles of uninhabited land. The road system, however is inversely<br>proportionate to the territory with only one major north-south highway, but there are plenty of<br>secondary (unpaved) roads that allow for a lot of driving/RV-ing. There are hundreds of miles of<br>hiking/biking trails, and in the winter even more room without trails. Hunting, fishing, boating,<br>skiing... you name it, Alaska has it.<br>(U) Is having to ring twice for room service your idea of roughing it? Would you prefer<br>something less strenuous, more genteel? My wife and I attended "St. Matthew's Passion" in<br><br> </p>English, in its entirety, with two full orchestras, two adult choirs and a children's choir -- a oncein-a-generation, if not lifetime, experience. It was performed in Anchorage, NOT in New York,<br>Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, or Dallas! The arts are well represented here as<br>evidenced by a robust concert season and world-class entertainers who regularly cycle through.<br>Every summer from May through September, Anchorage puts on a Saturday Market that is easily<br>the equivalent of the Sugar Loaf Mountain crafts festival in the DC metropolitan area. Pick a<br>medium... wood, metal, plastic, fur, ivory, gold, papier mache, stone grass, glass baleen, etc.<br>and you can find world-class artisans displaying their wares.<br>(U) Downside (for some) is remoteness, i.e. the distance from family and friends in the Lower<br>48. Daylight can exceed 19 Â½ hours around the summer solstice, and many newcomers find<br>that disconcerting -- but that's why God invented eyelids. During the winter, there is only about<br>5 Â½ hours of daylight, which can result in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in some who are<br>susceptible. Nevertheless, full-spectrum lights, light boxes and plenty of activity can counteract<br>those effects.<br>(U) When we first arrived, locals could identify us as cheechakos ("newcomers") because every<br>time we stepped outside to look at the scenery, we'd say, "Gee..." Sourdoughs ("pioneers")<br>would tell us, "When you've been here awhile, you'll begin to say, 'Just another pretty<br>mountain.'" That hasn't happened yet, and it's not likely to. Even lifelong Alaskans constantly<br>remark, "Did you see the sunrise this morning? Last night the sky was like a large, green<br>dancing curtain." All in all, if you spend any length of time in Alaska, you may love it or hate it,<br>but you are not likely to forget it.<br>(U//FOUO) Here's an "EXECmessage" about the switch from NCPRA (NSA/CSS Pacific<br>Representative Alaska) to NCNAR: <br>(U//FOUO) If you are thinking of applying for a field position, see the Field Vacancy<br>Announcements .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
