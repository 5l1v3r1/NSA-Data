We don't update this page anymore, it became somewhat of a Chinese menu for effects operations. Information is now available for JTRIG staff at [[1]^]

[edit] Understanding this page

Tools and techniques are developed by various teams within JTRIG. We like to let people know when we have something that we can think we can use,
but we also dont want to oversell our capability.

For this reason, each tool indicates its current status. We may put up experimental tools or ones that are still in development so you know what we are
working on, and can approach JTRIG with any new ideas. But experimental tools by their nature will be unreliable, if you raise expectations or make
external commitments before speaking to us you will probably end up looking stupid.

Most of our tools are fully operational, tested and reliable. We will indicate when this is the case; however there can be reasons why our tools wont work
for some operational requirements (eg if it exploits a provider specific vulnerability). There may also be legal restrictions.

So please come and speak to JTRIG operational staff early in your operational planning process.

[edit] Effects Capability

JTRIG develop the majority of effects capability in GCHQ. A lot of this capability is developed on demand for specific operations and then further
developed to provide weaponised capability.

Dont treat this like a catalogue. If you dont see it here, it doesn't mean we cant build it. If you involve the JTRIG operational teams at the start of your
operation, you have more of a chance that we will build something for you.

For each of our tools we have indicated the state of the tool. We only advertise tools here that are either ready to fire or very close to being ready
(operational requirements would re-prioritise our development). Once again, involve the JTRIG operational teams early.
