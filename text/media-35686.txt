(S)Hop-Point
Computer exploited by an actor
Generally of little Intelligence value

Used to connect to victims and conduct
operations

 

(TS)Majority of BC hop-points are US based.

?(TS)There are a number of foreign hop-points as well.

 

CCNE targets foreign hop-points

- began conducting numerous operations on hop-points.
- Exploiting new hosts
- Collecting from existing hosts

- (TS)Started to put some pieces together and found the IP ranges the
actors were coming from.

Unfortunately for us, the range is dynamic
- Difficult to track
- Difficult to target

- 
- Targeting the infrastructure of BC
- Exploited key routers in the ISP
Gained access to billing and customer records.
- Attribute user accounts to IP addresses on a given date/time
- Ability to attribute a CNE event to a user account
- Attribute user account names to billing addresses
- Billing address is 3PLA

TOP SECRETIICOMINTIIREL To USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL 21

TOP SECRETIICOMINTIIREL can attribute CNE events to user accounts. What else can
we do?

Using router accesses we can survey and capture remote
desktop traffic exiting the source range.

- New hop points!
- Exploit the source network.
- Man-in-the-Middle operation

- We sit in the middle of the traffic, we can observe it and
modify it.

- Let?s add something extra to the traffic.

different story.
