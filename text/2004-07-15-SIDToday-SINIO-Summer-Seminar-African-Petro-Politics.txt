Advance<br>registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for instructions.<br>(U) Course Overview:<br>(U) African oil production is increasing dramatically. By 2015, the United States will depend on<br>West African oil for 25% of its oil imports. U.S. investments in energy projects in the Gulf of<br>Guinea have reached billions of dollars each year. Oil production in Sudan has been a factor in<br>the Sudanese civil war, with oil wealth sharing being a primary negotiating issue in the peace<br>process. Oil has played a role in the extent of corruption and in sustaining military might in<br>several African countries. The historical development of the industry in select African countries<br>and the impact of oil on their economies will be addressed. Finally, threats to - and security of the oil producing areas in West Africa will be discussed (including U.S. engagement to improve<br>security).<br>(S) This brown bag session is classified (TS//SI).
