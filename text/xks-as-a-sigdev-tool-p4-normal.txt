What makes XKS so good at SIGDEV?

•	XKS gives analysts unique access to
terabytes of content and meta-data

•	Typically sites select and forward to
PINWALE less than 5% of the DNI
they're processing

The rest of that data used to be dropped
but is now being retained temporarily
and made available to analysts through
X-KEYSCORE

• As an example, at one our sites XKS
sees more data per day than all of
PINWALE
