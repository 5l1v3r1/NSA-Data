That's how I imagine the US Coast Guard (USCG) may see<br>itself these days.<br>(U//FOUO) USCG's varied missions* lead to a plethora of intelligence requirements. Thanks to<br>the Customer SCORECARD , an S11 initiative designed to measure our customers' needs and<br>satisfaction with SID support, we have the top ten prioritized requirements straight from Mr.<br>James Sloan, the Assistant Commandant for Intelligence at Coast Guard HQ in Washington, D.C.<br>The SEAM (Senior Executive Account Manager) for Coast Guard conducted a SCORECARD<br>discussion with Mr. Sloan in October, and part of the discussion involved USCG's ten most<br>important mission requirements for the upcoming 6-12 months.<br>(S//SI) And now, in the time-honored style of David Letterman, here are the USCG's top ten:<br>Number 10 - Piracy on the high seas<br>Number 9 - International Fisheries<br>Number 8 - Alien Smuggling<br>Number 7 - International Crime and Narcotics<br>Number 6 - Indications and Warning of Mass Migration<br>Number 5 - Counter Proliferation and Weapons of Mass Destruction<br>Number 4 - Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security<br>Number 3 - ELINT - White Ship Tracking**<br>Number 2 - Search and Rescue<br>And Number 1, as with many other organizations, is Counterterrorism<br>(S//SI) These requirements are supported by many SID elements, including International Crime<br>and Narcotics (S2F); Proliferation and Arms Control (S2G); Maritime Analysis Support Team<br>(S2JF3); Counterterrorism (S2I); Regional Targets (S2A); and the SANDKEY program .<br>Moreover, we have CSG support in Alameda, CA, at USCG's MIFC PAC (Maritime Intelligence<br>Fusion Center - Pacific) and in Key West, through JIATF-SOUTH (Joint Interagency Task Force South).<br>(U) In addition, Mr. Sloan gave SID very high marks regarding his organization's satisfaction<br>with the NSA-USCG relationship.

It was variously known as, "the system of cutters," the<br>"Revenue Marine," the "Revenue-Marine Service," the "Revenue Service" and the "RevenueCutter Service." In 1915, the Revenue-Cutter Service and another organization, the Lifesaving<br>Service, were combined to form the U.S. Coast Guard.<br>(U) The USCG is responsible for the safety of the nation's waterways, the enforcement of laws<br>relating to navigation, the protection of our maritime resources and the rescue of those in<br>danger at sea. It became a member of the intelligence community in 2001, part of the<br>cryptologic community in 2002 and, finally, was transferred from the Department of<br>Transportation to become an element of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003.<br>**(U) White ship tracking = "All non-military, non-public merchant shipping"<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
