Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 05/07/2004<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III <br>SID Chief of Staff <br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This article was posted on September 4, 2003, as part<br>of Charles Berlin's series on leadership .<br>(U) So far in this series, I have suggested that people are good and that<br>leadership makes a difference. From the feedback I have received, I say that<br>these ideas are not universally held - but getting us talking about this is really<br>what we are after. Discuss these premises with your office mates and see what you think.<br>(U) Meanwhile, let's talk about what a leader does:<br>(U//FOUO) A Leader is Prepared . Let's face it: this is a technical agency with technical people.<br>A leader must be technically savvy and up-to-date on our business. You are not going to<br>succeed as a leader unless you are an expert in your field. Know the mission and know the<br>technical underpinnings of it. Get out and make your bones. If this means taking a job that is<br>"lower" than the one you have now, take it. If it means going to night school, do it. NSA is a<br>winner because of expert people who know what they are doing - our successes look like<br>miracles to our customers, but we know it was not hardware or software but human brainpower<br>("wetware") that made it happen. Yes, I know the OPM competencies don't include technical<br>expertise on the senior P3's, but don't fool yourself - it doesn't list future potential either, but<br>that figures in every promotion authority's judgment. Become an expert manager as well. Learn<br>the resource game, get some experience in finance and the other enabling areas. Your ability to<br>use mission-based, technical judgment in resource decisions will make or break you as a leader<br>here at NSA.<br>(U) A Leader Develops Other Leaders . Guess what? The main job of the leader is actually not<br>getting the mission done. Your people will do that. Your main job is developing the next<br>generation and finding the ones who will take your job someday. This means you will have to<br>make the organization suffer a bit to make sure talented, high potential people get leadership<br>training and developmental jobs. This is an investment, not a cost. An important job for leaders<br>in this regard is talent spotting. The truth is, everyone is not equal (yikes!). A leader must make<br>a judgment about people and take action to accelerate the careers of those who show promise.<br>This is not cronyism or illegal discrimination; it is a duty. Find, identify and develop the best<br>people - they are the next generation.<br>(U) A Leader is a Servant . Speaking of the generations, we have more than one in the<br>workplace today (perhaps as many as four!). We have a unique challenge to transfer the<br>experience and knowledge of the baby boomers to the Gen X and Gen Y folks we have been<br>hiring. A leader seeks to understand the generations and facilitate the knowledge transfer. The<br>younger generation will challenge us old fogies in this transfer. They are not employees - they<br>consider themselves "consumers of management services". The role of a leader will change as a<br>true collaborative environment emerges. "Your people" will be working on someone else's<br>project even as they sit in "your spaces". The leader's role may shift to more of a talent scout<br>and talent agent for the individual employee rather than the director of work. So individual and<br>team development is the focus. In the hierarchical model, the middle manager had a primary<br>role of conveying information up and down the chain. In a transparent network, the information<br>passes itself. The leader now must focus on delivery of services to the workforce (resources,<br>tools, training, etc). Your value-added will rest not with your position but your ability to deliver.<br>Day to day, the leader becomes a linchpin servant, serving the boss and the employee. Are you<br><br> </p>ready?<br>(U) A Leader Cares . You have to know your people and care for them. These are actually<br>people, not machines. When I took over the job I am in now, I went around and interviewed<br>each person to get to know them. I asked about their history and their future. I also asked some<br>personal questions about family, home and the commute. A few employees wondered if I had<br>any legal right to ask those questions! I said I had no right but that I cared about the answers.<br>None chose not to answer. I found richness in their lives and it helps me every day to remember<br>they are not "assets", "workforce", "annuitants", "char force" or "cost centers". They are great<br>Americans with hopes and dreams for themselves, their families and their country. They are<br>worthy of a leader's care. You are expected to expend effort on these people's behalf. You<br>cannot care from a distance or at a theoretical level. You actually have to do something. What<br>have you done lately?<br>(U) Care for the mission too. Sometimes I think we are trying to wash passion out of our<br>culture. Lots of cold hard statistics and metrics to light the way. I don't want you to let the<br>metrics tell you things aren't going to work, I want you to declare emphatically that you will<br>make it work with all the heart you have. Don't let the future happen to you - make the future<br>happen. It takes a bit of passion for a leader to succeed. Do you have the strength of spirit to<br>lead?<br>(U) A Leader Communicates . Here's some news: passion for the mission and caring for the<br>people can actually be communicated. It's catchy, it's infectious. It shouldn't be a secret! A<br>major component in keeping hope alive is a healthy conversation with your people. In this<br>conversation, a leader communicates values - expectations of behavior and outcomes. A leader<br>describes the culture and atmosphere of the organization. Communication is not just in words<br>but action. A leader communicates values by example. Every word and act is a communication.<br>What do you have to say?<br>(U) Like I said, keep the cards and letters coming.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
