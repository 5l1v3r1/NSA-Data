"By Listening and Learning:<br>Adversarial Attempts To Foil the US Intelligence Gathering System" will be presented by <br>, D/SINIO for Information Operations and Denial and Deception, on Tuesday, 29 June,<br>from 1130-1300 in Room 2N044 . Advanced registration is required - instructions follow.<br>(U) Course Overview:<br>(S) A day hasn't gone by that our adversaries haven't picked up a newspaper or gone on the<br>Internet to learn something new about how the US intelligence gathering system operates and<br>what its capabilities or limitations are. And in response, a day hasn't gone by that our<br>adversaries haven't modified their operations and activities to avoid being detected and collected<br>against by the US intelligence gathering system. From US military operations to domestic public<br>discussions on intelligence "failures," our adversaries are learning and developing ways to foil<br>our intelligence gathering system, sometimes with the simplest, inexpensive low-tech tool to<br>defeat our expensive, high-tech systems. This class will highlight some of the latest denial &amp;<br>deception programs that our adversaries are employing and will encourage participants to think<br>about and discuss ways to identify and counter these programs, particularly those that have the<br>potential to "deafen" our SIGINT system.<br>(U) Registration Information:<br>(U//FOUO) Advance registration is required; eligible SID students interested in attending this<br>brown-bag session should enroll for class number 6984 using Peoplesoft.
