2.	Performs strong (e.g. email) and soft (content) selection

3.	Provides real-time target activity (tipping)

4.	"Rolling Buffer" of ~3 days of ALL unfiltered data seen by
XKEYSCORE:

•	Stores full-take data at the collection site - indexed by meta-data

•	Provides a series of viewers for common data types

1.	Federated Query system - one query scans all sites

•	Performing full-take allows analysts to find targets that were
previously unknown by mining the meta-data

•	Small, focused team

•	Work closely with the analysts

•	Evolutionary development cycle (deploy early, deploy often)

•	React to mission requirements

•	Support staff integrated with developers

•	Sometimes a delicate balance of mission and research

•	Massive distributed Linux cluster

•	Over 500 servers distributed around the world

•	System can scale linearly - simply add a new

server to the cluster
• Federated Query Mechanism

• Strong Selection itself give us only a very
limited capability

•	A large amount of time spent on the web is
performing actions that are anonymous

•	We can use this traffic to detect anomalies
which can lead us to intelligence by itself, or
strong selectors for traditional tasking

Plug-in	DESCRIPTION
E-mail Addresses	Indexes every E-mail address seen in a session by both username and domain
	
Extracted Files	Indexes every file seen in a session by both filename and extension
	
Full Log	Indexes every DNI session collected. Data is indexed by the standard N-tupple (IP, Port, Casenotation etc.)
HTTP Parser	Indexes the client-side HTTP traffic (examples to follow)
Phone Number	Indexes every phone number seen in a session (e.g. address book entries or signature block)
User Activity	Indexes the Webmail and Chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc.

• Anything you wish to extract

•	Choose your metadata

•	Customizable storage times

Ex: HTTP Parser

GET /search?hi=en&q=i slamabad&metal= HTTP/1.0

Accept: image/gir, image/x-xpitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-

• How do I find a strong-selector for a known
target?

• How do I find a cell of terrorists that has no
connection to known strong-selectors?

• Answer: Look for anomalous events

•	E.g. Someone whose language is out of place for the
region they are In

•	Someone who is using encryption

•	Someone searching the web for suspicious stuff

• Show me all the encrypted word

documents from Iran
• Show me all PGP usage in Iran

•	Once again - data volume too high so
forwarding these back is not possible

•	No strong-selector

•	Can perform this kind of retrospective
query, then simply pull content of interest
from site as required

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

• Show me all the VPN startups in
country X, and give me the data so I
can decrypt and discover the users

• These events are easily browsable in
XKEYSCORE

• No strong-selector

• XKEYSCORE extracts and stores authoring
information for many major document types - can
perform a retrospective survey to trace the
document origin since metadata is typically kept for
up to 30 days

• No other system performs this on raw unselected
bulk traffic, data volumes prohibit forwarding

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

• Traditionally triggered by a strong-selector
event, but it doesn't have to be this way

•	Reverse PSC - from anomalous event back to
a strong selector. You cannot perform this
kind of analysis when the data has first been
strong selected.

•	Tie in with Marina - allow PSC collection after
the event

My target speaks German but is in
Pakistan - how can I find him?

•	XKEYSCORE's HTTP Activity plugin extracts
and stores all HTML language tags which
can then be searched

•	Not possible in any other system but
XKEYSCORE, nor could It be -

•	volumes are too great to forward

•	No strong-selector

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

• My target uses Google Maps to scope target
locations - can I use this information to
determine his email address? What about the
web-searches - do any stand out and look
suspicious?

•	XKEYSCORE extracts and databases these events
including all web-based searches which can be
retrospectively queried

•	No strong-selector

•	Data volume too high to forward

• I have a Jihadist document that
has been passed around through
numerous people, who wrote this
and where were they?

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

• Show me all the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
containing MAC addresses coming out of Iraq
so I can perform network mapping

•	New extractor allows different dictionaries to run on
document/email bodies - these more complex
dictionaries can generate and database this
information

•	No strong-selector

•	Data volume is high

•	Multiple dictionaries targeted at specific data types

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

• Show me all the exploitable machines in
country X

•	Fingerprints from TAO are loaded into
XKEYSCORE's application/fingerprintID
engine

•	Data is tagged and databased

•	No strong-selector

•	Complex boolean tasking and regular
expressions required
