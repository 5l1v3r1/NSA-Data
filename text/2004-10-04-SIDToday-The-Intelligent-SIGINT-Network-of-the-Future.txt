DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) The Intelligent SIGINT Network of the Future<br>FROM: <br>Network Analysis Center (S31SD)<br>Run Date: 10/04/2004<br><br>(S//SI) Wouldn't it be great if SIGINT, in near real-time, provided alerts to war fighters on the<br>ground telling them when and where high-value targets were active on the Global Net? What if<br>a system existed that could dynamically update tasking selectors based on current target<br>activity? What if there was one place an analyst could go to monitor target activity from a wide<br>variety of SIGINT accesses? If you think capabilities like these are still years away from being a<br>reality, we'd like to take a moment to tell you about TRAFFICTHIEF.<br>(TS//SI) TRAFFICTHIEF is a service that interconnects disjoint collection systems from active,<br>passive, and warranted SIGINT accesses via a central messaging service. These collection<br>systems pass messages containing SIGINT "events" of interest to a central server to provide<br>near real-time alerts of targets on the Global Net. These event messages are processed by a<br>centralized TRAFFICTHIEF server and can be forwarded to analysts for action or to other<br>collection systems to automatically update tasking selectors. An expert system provides<br>"intelligence" to the TRAFFICTHIEF network by appropriately routing the messages through the<br>central server.<br>(S//SI) Started in July 2003 as a rapid prototype development, TRAFFICTHIEF has been<br>operational on a 24/7 basis since February 2004. It has quickly become a critical link between<br>SIGINT collection and ground operations in Iraq, and has helped enable the capture of several<br>high-priority Counter-terrrorism targets.<br>(S//SI) But why stop there? By combining information from a wide variety of access points with<br>a variety of target knowledge bases, the possibilities are virtually limitless. For instance<br>TRAFFICTHIEF could be used to:<br>Integrate survey and network characterization results with target monitoring in order to<br>steer the SIGINT collection system in real time. In addition to allowing us to narrow in on<br>targets of interest, this would improve the efficiency of our limited collection resources<br>and drastically reduce the amount of traffic that analysts need to sift through in order to<br>find their targets' communications.<br>Provide qualitative metrics for collection systems and observed links based on the types<br>of SIGINT events generated.<br>Supplement SIGINT events with knowledge gained from open source and previous<br>analysis.<br>The TRAFFICTHIEF team is currently working on ways to make these enhancements a reality.<br>(S//SI) In a very short time, TRAFFICTHIEF has proven the value of transforming our SIGINT<br>collection architecture into an intelligent network. By combining information from a diverse set<br>of collection assets, it truly has the potential to revolutionize the way that we do business. If you<br>are a target analyst, TRAFFICTHIEF can help you track your targets more efficiently. If you are a<br>system developer, TRAFFICTHIEF can help you move your metadata across the SIGINT system.<br>If you are developing a target knowledge base, TRAFFICTHIEF can increase the relevance of<br>your analysis by supplementing collection with your data. So take a moment to look over the<br>information available on the TRAFFICTHIEF web page to see how you can get involved today.<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
