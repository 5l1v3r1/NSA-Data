It is, in fact, a requirement for<br>working here. However, there are those among us who have expressed that deep and nearly<br>indefinable sense of duty and loyalty in a very overt manner. They are naturalized citizens, who<br>in response to the attacks of September 11, volunteered their talents to defend their chosen<br>homeland, hoping their service might show their love, their sense of duty...their patriotism.<br>What follows is the story of <br> one such SID employee:<br>(U) My family migrated to the United States in 1983, but decided to go back to Jerusalem. I<br>returned to the U.S. in 1989 after I graduated from high school. It was the second year of the<br>Palestinian Intifada, and attending college was nearly impossible. So, I came back to America to<br>continue my education.<br>(U) I spent the first year in a small private college in Mt. Vernon, Georgia. A year later, I<br>transferred to the University of Maryland. I graduated in 1995 with two degrees in Business<br>Administration, one in Marketing and the other in International Business.<br>(U) I began work at a Web-hosting product group in 1997. I was married in 1998. After the<br>birth of my son in 2001, working outside the home was not as important to me. I had no<br>intentions of going back to the workforce, until September 11th, 2001.<br>(U//FOUO) As I tried to absorb all that came with that numbing event, I remembered the oath I<br>took when I became a citizen, to protect and defend this country and I thought, "Now, my<br>country needs my skills to fight this war on terrorism." I applied to -- and was hired by -- the<br>FBI to work as a linguist. I later came to NSA.<br>(U) I feel privileged that I am able to give back to the country that gave me more than my own<br>birthplace was able to give. The U.S. gave me the opportunity to get an education, a job, and to<br>become one of its citizens without feeling that I was different or did not belong. I was able to<br>participate in any program, from health care to retirement, just like any other citizen. I have the<br>same privileges and access as anyone born here. In Jerusalem, where I was born, I was banned<br>from many programs. When I think about the rights and privileges offered to me in my<br>birthplace compared to the ones of my adopted country, I have a feeling I cannot describe or<br>put into words, except to say: " God bless America!"<br>(U) You can read more about what <br><br> has been doing since she came to SID here.<br><br>(U) Have a safe and happy 4th of July and remember those who will be here at work and those<br>on the front lines who are ensuring our continued independence!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
