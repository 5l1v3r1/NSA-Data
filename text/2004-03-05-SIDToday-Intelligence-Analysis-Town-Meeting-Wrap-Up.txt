I'm not sure why, but my sincerest apologies to any<br>of you who tuned in at 0900 and got nothing.<br>(U//FOUO) We've posted all the briefers' slides on our homepage -- it's the last item under "IA<br>Skill Community Information" ("Go IASC").<br>(U) The videotape has to be reviewed for classification and then duped before copies will be<br>available. You may request a copy of the Town Meeting by sending an email to<br>nsa<br>(DL TAPEDUPE from an NT) with the following information:<br>Your name <br>Your building <br>Your room number <br>Your suite number.<br>(U) Be sure to specify the name and date of the program: IASC Town Meeting, 27 February<br>2004.<br>(U) We're also investigating converting the VHS tape to digital and making it available as<br>streamed video on the ANALYSToday portal. I'll keep you posted on all that.<br>And thanks again!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
