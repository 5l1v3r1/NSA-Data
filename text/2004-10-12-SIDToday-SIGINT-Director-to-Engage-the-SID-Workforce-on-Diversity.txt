At the initial session on that date, I would like to share with those interested in<br>minority issues what I have learned in recent months and the initial steps I have decided to take<br>to address some areas of concern. I welcome you to join me in my commitment to a program of<br>fairness and inclusion for SID's future. I am convinced that we must be an employer of choice for<br>diverse and talented employees if we are to succeed in coming years.<br>(U//FOUO) After the general session on issues related to all minorities, I intend to have separate<br>sessions to focus on concerns for specific segments of SID's minority workforce. Those smaller<br>sessions will lend themselves to interaction and discussion along the lines of what some of you<br>are familiar with in SID's "What's on Your Mind" sessions.<br>(U//FOUO) Later, I hope to have the opportunity to engage the workforce further - in even<br>smaller groups. I appreciate your support as we continue to expand our transformation into the<br>people aspect of our business.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
