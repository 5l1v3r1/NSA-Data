l. Project BULLRUN deals with abilities to defeat the 
used in speci?c network communication technologies. BULLRUN involves multiple
sources, all of which are extremely sensitive. They include CNE, interdiction, industry
relationships, collaboration with other IC entities, and advanced mathematical techniques.
Several ECIs apply to the speci?c sources, methods, and techniques involved. Because
of the multiple sources involved in BULLRUN activities, ?capabilities against a
technology? does not necessarily equate to 

 

 

2. The BULLRUN data label (for use in databases) and marking (for use in
hard- or softcopy documents) are for internal use only. It will appear in the
classi?cation line and corresponding portion markings after all applicable ODNI-
approved markings are in place. The format is:

(U) HTTP traf?c secured inside an session, indicated by the URL, commonly
using TCP port 443

(U) IPSEC -- or IP Security, is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard for layer 3
real-time communication security. allows two hosts (or two gateways) to establish a secure
connection, sometimes called a tunnel. All traf?c is protected at the network layer. (IETF is the Internet
Engineering Task Force, a loosely self-organized group of people who contribute to the engineering and
evolution of Internet technologies. It is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet
standard speci?cations.)

(U) PPTP Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is a method for implementing virtual private networks.
The PPTP speci?cation does not describe or authentication features and relies on the protocol
being tunneled to implement security functionality.

(U) SSH Secure Shell. A common protocol used for secure remote computer access

(U) SSL Secure Sockets Layer. Commonly used to provide secure network communication. Widely
used on the intemet to provide secure web browsing, webmail, instant messaging, electronic commerce, etc.

(U) TLS Transport Layer Security. The follow-on to SSL, SSLV3 and .0 are nearly identical.

(U) Voice over Internet Protocol. A general term for the using IP networks to make voice phone
calls. The application layer protocol can be standards-based H.323, SIP), or proprietary Skype).

(U) VPN Virtual Private Network. A private network that makes use of the public telecommunications

infrastructure, maintaining privacy via the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures that typically
include Common protocols include IPSEC and PPTP.
