DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U) SID Overtime/Comp Time/Credit Hour Rules and Guidance<br>FROM:<br>SID Workforce Performance Executive (S01P3)<br>Run Date: 04/05/2004<br><br>(U) SID wants to ensure all managers and employees are consistently guided by the same policy<br>and procedures for the approval of overtime pay, compensatory (comp) time accrual and use<br>and credit hours. Agency policies simply specify that key components and field chiefs have been<br>delegated the authority to approve overtime and comp time and this authority may be redelegated to the lowest level for efficiency.<br>(U) Below is some background information, guidance and suggestions to help managers and<br>their employees more effectively manage their work and personal lives. Although we may<br>occasionally have to set aside our private life to meet exceptional demands, the importance of<br>our families and personal lives should not be underestimated or forgotten. A balanced work and<br>personal life is critical to a person's well being and the Agency mission.<br>(U) As General Hayden has stated:<br>"Because of the NSA/CSS work force's hard work and unfailing dedication to mission, we often<br>push ourselves way beyond reasonable limits in the hours we work. I am keenly aware that<br>these efforts can come with a high price for our mental and physical health and family life.<br>Please remember that care for yourself and your family is as critical to mission success as<br>putting in the many hours I have witnessed by our work force."<br>(U) We all need to maintain a balance between our home and work life. As managers, we must<br>be aware of the need for work/life balance and we should encourage our work force to find this<br>balance. However, managers need to lead by example; we cannot say one thing and then do<br>another. There may be a perception that employees must put in the same long hours and<br>weekends that managers work in order to receive promotions and awards. This is not the best<br>leadership example and it may also be misinterpreted by the work force.<br>(U//FOUO) SID Overtime/Comp/Credit Use Stats<br>(U//FOUO) We reviewed the numbers for overtime, comp time, and credit hours earned and<br>have found a staggering increase within SID since 9/11:<br>Overtime Hours Paid<br>FY01<br><br>info not available<br><br>FY02<br><br>27,449<br><br>FY03<br><br>92,688<br><br>FY04 (1 month)<br><br>15,441<br><br>Comp Time Hours Paid<br>FY01<br><br>info not available<br><br>FY02<br><br>1,014<br><br>FY03<br><br>3,136<br><br>FY04 (1 month)<br><br>709<br><br>Comp Time Hours Accrued<br><br> </p>FY01<br><br>24,547<br><br>FY02<br><br>84,775<br><br>FY03<br><br>89,397<br><br>FY04 (1 month)<br><br>5,646<br><br>Credit Hours Forfeited (just for those recorded on time sheets)<br>FY01<br><br>68,763<br><br>FY02<br><br>571,414<br><br>FY03<br><br>597,208<br><br>FY04 (1 month)<br><br>59,797<br><br>Annual Leave Forfeited (does not include annual leave given away)<br>FY01<br><br>27,462 (14,863 restored)<br><br>FY02<br><br>36,329 (17,282 restored)<br><br>FY03<br><br>(TBD leave year ended 9<br>Jan 04)<br><br>(U) You can easily see the trend. Our people - managers and employees alike - cannot keep up<br>this pace without breakage, either at home or at work. With this information in mind, we are<br>providing some basic ground rules, some guidance and suggestions of ways to help the work/life<br>balance for employees.<br>(U) Policy<br>(U) Valid reasons for a manager to approve overtime (regular scheduled or irregular) or comp<br>time include:<br>To meet intelligence objective requirements<br>Crisis situations<br>Scheduled overtime (i.e.; 24/7 shops)<br>Temporary, unexpected increases in workload<br>(U) The following are not valid reasons for approving overtime or comp time:<br>Manpower shortages<br>Poor management<br>Using overtime pay and comp time to compensate for poor annual leave scheduling<br>Using overtime as a means of increasing personal compensation<br>(U) The above information is available in the abbreviated form of a "cheat sheet" that gives the<br>basic "do's and don'ts" for overtime, comp time and credit hours. In addition, a listing of helpful<br>URLs is available. Finally, a reference document with detailed information on Ideas for<br>Scheduling Work Hours is posted on the Workforce Performance Management webpage .<br>(U) Summation<br>(U) The bottom line is to prevent burnout, minimize personal, physical, psychological issues and<br>mission loss. SID wants to maintain a happy, satisfied workforce that contributes to the overall<br>productivity and success of the mission. This can only happen if we all balance our work and<br>personal lives.<br><br> </p>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
