RAMP ART-A Overview

Covername for NSA's unconventional special access program

to gain access to high-capacity international fiber-optic cables that transit at major
congestion points around the world.

Program started in 1992 with the establishment of the National Fiber Optic

Program Fund

a Four initial global congestion points identified
a Extended Bi-lat partnerships w/FAD to new compartmented efforts

General agreements negotiated:
a Foreign Partners provide access to cables and host US equipment
a US provides equipment for transport, processing, & analysis
a No US collection by Partner and No Host Country collection by US
a Shared tasking & collection

Project Description

© (TS//SI) RAMPART-A's accesses target long-haul
leased communications through international
gateways. Circuit-Switched and Packet-Switch signals
are enabled by foreign partners. Collection and
Processing assets reside on foreign soil and traffic Is
exfilled back to NSAW.

© (TS//SI) Access Types: International Gateway
Switches; End-Point GSM Switches; Leased Internet
Circuits; Internet Backbone Routers; Call Records.

© (S//SI) Every Country Code in the world is seen at
one or more RAMPART-A collection accesses
