A, VPN ?Surge?

- Main Goal:
To evaluate SCS VPN access and analysis to determine better methods
of identifying and exploiting networks of interest.
- Two Focuses:
What can we do with VPN data that is already ingested into the system?

- Find better methods of reporting VPN stats and exploitation
determinations from CES back to 880 and site.

Are there methods to better identify and survey to provide CES
the data they need?

- Can we leverage MIRROR, DARKQUEST, PANOPLY survey

information to quickly identify and report the presence of in
surveyed signals?

- Can we use BIRDWATCHER or other means to automatically
resurvey for key exchanges and obtain paired collect?
