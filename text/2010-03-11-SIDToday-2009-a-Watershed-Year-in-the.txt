(U) 2009: A Watershed Year in the Fight Against Terrorism

FROM: (U//FOUO)

Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC)

Run Date: 03/11/2010

(S//SI//REL) On behalf of the Associate Deputy Director for Counterterrorism	it is our pleasure

to present the Counterterrorism Year in Review for 2009. The past year was a watershed period in the fight
against terrorism and radical extremist groups. SIGINT was vital to successes against Al-Qa'ida (AQ)
operatives within the United States, in East Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, and more. For example,
SIGINT first identified terrorism suspect Najibullah Zazi's email connection to AQ external operations
planners in Pakistan. Without that SIGINT lead on Zazi, his activities might not have come to the attention
of the US intelligence and law enforcement communities until he actually conducted a terrorist attack
against the US homeland. (Zazi was arrested in September.)

(S//SI//REL) We adapted as the terrorist landscape changed. As the war in Iraq began winding down, we
ramped up SIGINT support to the Afghanistan surge. With FBI, we hindered an AQ effort to influence the
German presidential elections and thereby remove German troops from the coalition in Afghanistan. We
helped thwart several Lashkar e-Tayyiba attacks against India. There were successes against AQ East
Africa/al-Shabaab militants in Somalia. Additionally, the Islamic Jihad Union lost its leader and deputy
leader in a missile strike. Shortly after a senior operational planner of Jemaah Islamiya (JI) made overtures
to AQ senior leadership for JI to become AQ's franchise in the Asia Pacific region, he was killed by
Indonesian security forces.

(S//SI//REL) In many cases, NSA provided the vital intelligence that enabled capture/kill operations. In
virtually all major IC, DoD and foreign partner successes, SIGINT was critical in developing the leads and
pattern of life that eventually led to the successes. Additionally, NSA led the Intelligence Community in
building partnerships, capabilities, strategies, and collaboration to ensure future successes.

(U//FOUO) We encourage you to read this collection of successes and view them as a measure of NSA's
contributions against terrorism. The efforts undertaken by our men and women working CT SIGINT
worldwide, and with our partners and customers in the intelligence community, the armed forces and other
partners, at home and around the world make all these successes possible. These professionals provide
intelligence support needed to protect our troops and ensure operational success. Their dedication,
commitment, and professionalism, are unparalleled and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. They remain
our first line of defense in the fight.
