"Wireless" is defined as those<br>personal communications devices offering mobility and location-based services such as cell<br>phones, satellite phones, trunk mobile radio, WLAN and the like. Its challenges are primarily<br>persistent access, user identification, and geolocation. Not to be overlooked, these devices also<br>sport some very hard encryption.<br>(TS//SI) Recognizing at that time that the exploitation of this critical set of technologies lacked a<br>comprehensive and cohesive strategy, both internal to NSA and across the IC, Mr. Landolf set<br>plans in motion to formalize our activities. By late 2002 the Wireless Portfolio Management<br>Office was established, and strategy and governance of our exploitation capabilities against<br>wireless communications began in earnest. The role of the WPMO is to:<br>Define and Implement the Wireless Strategy<br>Shape and Influence Corporate Policy and Architecture<br>Align and Direct Efforts within NSA<br>Coordinate and Leverage Efforts within the 5-Eyes SIGINT Community<br>Monitor and Influence Efforts within the US Intelligence Community<br>(TS//SI) To date, the WPMO has developed a Wireless Strategy, a Wireless Implementation Plan,<br>USSID 252 governing how wireless exploitation capabilities are shared and protected in tactical<br>environments, and a formal Memorandum of Agreement with the CIA on joint governance of<br>how wireless exploitation capabilities are shared with liaison entities. The WPMO routinely<br>coordinates input for the SID Senior Manager for Wireless, NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate,<br>military liaison offices, and others regarding the numerous requests received for specific,<br>immediate needs to share capabilities beyond NSA.<br>(TS//SI) In drawing up the Wireless Implementation Plan, the WPMO and extended team gained<br>comprehensive knowledge of NSA wireless development activities across Data Acquisition,<br>Analysis &amp; Production, and Research, including product specifications, limitations, budget and<br>sensitivity of the activity. The team documented both existing capabilities as well as what ought<br>to be initiated to better exploit the technology set.<br>(TS//SI) To get started, the team concentrated on the President's Approved Intelligence Topics<br>(NSPD-26) and quickly learned that every wireless technology was used by every Band-A<br>concern, meaning none of the technologies could be ignored. The team also embraced the<br>wireless strategy's four pillars for accessing wireless communications, in priority order of<br>consideration: Buy it, Enable it, Take it, and finally Collect it. In addition, the team looked at the<br>Foundational Tools and Services required to exploit wireless, an often-overlooked part of the<br>cost of doing business.<br>(TS//SI) We laid out program plans for a basic level, a credible level, and an unconstrained level<br>of investment. Moving away from proximal collectors toward accessing wireless data at the<br>network core will mean a significant increase in the Buy it, Enable it and Take it pillars -- what<br>that buys us in terms of tangible results is robust exploitation of most of the wireless<br>technologies used worldwide and improved global coverage. We must now move out smartly<br>toward making the plan a reality.<br>(S//SI) The Wireless Implementation Plan has been endorsed by MG Quirk and the SID Deputy<br>Directors.
