(TS//SI//REL) SIGINTers Use Human Language Technology to Great
Advantage, Isolate Conversation about Threat to US Official

FROM: Special Collection Service (SCS) Mexico City

Run Date: 09/14/2010

(TS//SI//REL) SCS Mexico City has been a test bed for human-language technology (HLT)
translation and selection software since May 2010. This capability, which the site's chief
compares to a cadre of extra scanners, allows language analysts to sift through hundreds of
hours of voice cuts in a matter of seconds and select items of potential interest based on
keywords or speaker voice recognition. The results have been dramatic.

(TS//SI//REL) In all of 2009, the site issued approximately
20 reports based on voice collection. By contrast, in just
three months of 2010 (May - July), the site produced 33
reports, all of which were selected using HLT software. Not
only does HLT allow site analysts to save hundreds of hours
scanning through an impossible volume of voice cuts, it
allows the site to focus on the intelligence items of greatest
importance to local and national customers.

(TS//SI//REL) The utility of this capability was vividly
highlighted on 2 August. The site was informed that a bomb
threat had been received by Mexico City's emergency
hotline, with the location, make, and tag number of the
vehicle where the bomb reportedly had been placed. When Mexico City police responded, they
discovered that the vehicle in question belonged to a U.S. Embassy official. Though no bomb
was found in or on the car, SCS Mexico City immediately began searching for reflections of this
bomb threat, using HLT to sift through over 1,300 voice conversations from 1 and 2 August
using the key word "bomba."

(TS//SI//REL) The filter returned 40 results, and the third hit on the list turned out to be a
Mexican Center for Investigation and National Security official investigating the bomb threat.

HLT allowed the site to isolate the conversation of interest in less than four minutes, a

task that might previously have taken all of the site's linguists the better part of the day to
accomplish.
