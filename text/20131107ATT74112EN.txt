1.	Session I will be dedicated to the exchange of views with Congressman Jim
Sensenbrenner, Member of the Committee on the Judiciary and Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.

Some LIBE members had the opportunity to meet the Congressman already in
Washington D.C in the framework of the LIBE Delegation which took place on 28-30
October 2013.

On 29 October Congressman Sensenbrenner and Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced the USA Freedom Act which is meant to
end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' communications
records by amending Section 215 of the Patriot Act, making numerous amendments
to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and creating a privacy advocate to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, who could argue civil liberties concerns and
appeal court decisions.

2.	Follow-up on the previous (7th November) hearing, Session II will continue exploring
the different national practices of parliamentary or other independent oversight of
national intelligence activities, with representatives of different Member States'
national Parliaments.

3.	Session III will focus on the involvement of the commercial companies in the US mass
surveillance activities. Representatives of Microsoft and Google will make a statement
about the allegations revealed by the media.
