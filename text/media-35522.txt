SPIN 15 VPN Story

VPN has two thrusts, one has high mission impacts and the other has high performance
and functionality impacts for Program B.

Mission impact Start generating SIGINT from VPNs at SMK.

SMK is a VPN rich environment with targets of high value. Mission impact is high.
Consumers of the SIGINT reporting based on sources from SMK are at high levels of
government. NSA leadership has tasked CES to deploy capabilities to SMK.
Security concerns have been addressed. SPFs have been signed to deploy equities
to the site. VPN transformation tests have passed and capabilities ready for
deployment to the T- 16 development server at SMK. To achieve a successful
deployment to SMK on the T-16s (first) and LPTs, the following are high level steps:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Task Owner Date

Load Spin 13 on T-16 DEV (first) Turmoil March

and then T-16 LIVE system

Configure Blade 14 for PIQ CES March
Services Spin 13.

Configure AMF/IslandHideaway AMF March

for PIQ blade and VAO messaging

traffic

Add 1P tasking to Keycard for CES March
VPNs of interest

Evaluate data in CES March/April
Xkeyscore for Strong Selectors

Update Keycard with Strong CES March/April
Selectors

Verify data which hits CES April

on a strong selector is forwarded
from Turmoil to Pressurewave

 

Verify can retrieve the CES April
data from Pressurewave for
reporting

 

Identify Dell for PIQ Blade at CES April
SMK for LPT DEV system

 

Load Spin (13/14 on LPT DEV Turmoil May
(first) and then the LPT LIVE
Systems

 

 

Configure Dell for PIQ Services CES May

Note: MDC upgrade and Site Store deployment at SMK will impact the VPN 
deployment. March 16-31 is the schedule for the upgrade and site store deployment.
VPN deployment may slip due to availability.

Risk Reduction Activity for Program 

Program Capabilities Document has provided Key Performance Paramerters (KPPs)
for VPN. In order to achieve the KPP identified for Sep 30, 2009, a risk reduction
activity has been initiated. This activity will gather performance benchmarks early in
SPIN 15 on the current architecture running on two 2.56 platforms, the T-16 Heavy and
the Dell LPT. Information from the performance benchmarks will indicate the level of
redesign (if any) needed to meet the KPPs. The following are the performance
requirements in Program B.

 

NCC CA Service Requests per hour (aggregate for all VPN exploitation-enabled systems).

requests Reiniect Rate?)

 

For tasked IP addresses, NCC front end systems shall identify relevant sessions and generate
attack requests (Rates?)

 

NCC front end systems shall buffer VPN data for up to 15 minutes (900 seconds) while waiting for
response from Attack Orchestrater (AO)

 

. After successful key recovery and PIQ services shall re-inject VPN for Stage1

. Aggregate VPN buffering and processing rate per TML system (Assumptions

A schedule has been proposed to gather the performance benchmarks on current turmoil
2.56 systems (T- 16 and LPT).
