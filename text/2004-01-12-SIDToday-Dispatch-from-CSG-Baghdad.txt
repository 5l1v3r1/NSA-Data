DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//REL) Dispatch from CSG Baghdad<br>FROM: an IA Intern Currently in Baghdad<br>Run Date: 01/12/2004<br><br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: We close out our<br>"IA Interns Abroad" series with this report from an analyst on the<br>ground in Baghdad:<br>(S//REL) When Operation Iraqi freedom began last March, I was<br>midway through my second tour as an Intelligence Analysis intern.<br>Having recently completed an Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction<br>tour, and working on a dynamic SIGINT assessment project for<br>CENTCOM in my new office, I found myself unsatisfied with the<br>prospect of watching this war on CNN. On March 20, the day after<br>the first bombs fell in Iraq, I volunteered for a NIST deployment.<br>(S//REL) With other mission obligations to fulfill, I wasn't able to<br>deploy until October 2003. By that point, I hoped there would still<br>be some value in going. "The war's over," people would say. "Why<br>would they send you to Iraq now ?" Within a few days of my<br>deployment, it was clear that perhaps the hardest part of this war<br>was still being fought by tens of thousands of military personnel. I<br>would be serving as one of only six analysts tasked with providing<br>SIGINT support to capture/kill operations and force-protection<br>actions executed by four large military divisions in the Iraqi<br>theater.<br>(S//REL) CSG Baghdad works hand-in-hand with the intelligence<br>components of Combined Joint Task Force 7 (CJTF-7), providing<br>everything from regular reports on SIGINT activity in suspicious<br>areas to real-time tracking of targeted handsets during operations.<br>Our team of fewer than fifteen people serves as "NSA forward,"<br>working with CENTCOM and the CJTF-7 Intelligence Fusion Center<br>to support and protect almost 100,000 troops, controlling twothirds of Iraq.<br>(S//REL) Unlike the sometimes black and white nature of active<br>combat, the current situation in Iraq is frequently gray. While local<br>Iraqi contractors cheerfully pour concrete in our parking lot, we<br>don't really know if any of them are working with the terrorists<br>lobbing mortars at our outer walls. A routine afternoon of guard<br>duty for a friend of mine suddenly turned when he was narrowly<br>missed by a sniper - while on our base. A colleague and I had lunch<br>at the Al Rashid hotel downtown a few short days before several<br>rockets hit the building. After my first of many nights walking<br>home from work in my flack vest and Kevlar helmet, I thought,<br>this isn't what I had in mind when Iraq was so quiet this summer.<br>(S//REL) But if things have to get worse before they get better,<br>they're certainly looking up now. I am now three months into a<br>four-month tour. During these three months, my team has<br>provided direct, actionable SIGINT support to dozens of operations<br>that have resulted in the capture or elimination of countless<br>terrorists. One month ago, we were among the first to know that<br>Saddam Hussein had been captured.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

Dispatch from CSG<br>Baghdad<br><br> </p>(S//REL) As a civilian analyst, I never thought I'd have the<br>opportunity to serve in a military operation. After my time in Iraq,<br>I have a new perspective on the men and women who protect our<br>nation's security on the front lines, while we support them from the<br>rear. Having lived with the troops for three months, in the same<br>dusty tents, eating the same unremarkable chow, I have begun to<br>consider them family. Someday I'll show my grandchildren pictures<br>of us opening our Christmas care packages, members of four<br>services and several civilian agencies all wearing the same uniform.<br>I'll tell the stories of being on watch when Ambassador Bremer<br>announced, "We got him." Of counting down to 2004 in Saddam's<br>palace, still carrying our rifles and pistols while defiantly enjoying<br>our New Year's Eve party. Walking to my office through the<br>inescapable mud and home through "celebratory" fire.<br>(S//REL) Mostly, I'll tell them how I traveled thousands of miles to<br>see for myself that the work we do really does make a difference to<br>the boots on the ground. Having worked now through three agency<br>elements in Phases I-IV of OIF - at the Fort and in the field - I am<br>firmly convinced that neither side can work effectively without the<br>other. I now see my work as both a privilege and an awesome<br>responsibility. When I return home, I surely won't miss the<br>grueling shifts, the dirt, the food, or the occasional fear. But I'll<br>leave knowing that this country is well on its way to recovery. And<br>we have helped.<br>(U//FOUO) SIGINT Communications would like to thank all of the<br>interns who contributed articles to this series.
