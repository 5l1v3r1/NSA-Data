The initial complement of 50 officers has grown to a current strength of<br>about 260 U.S. government staff and contractors. TTIC personnel are preparing to move in the<br>late May-early June time frame to the state-of-the-art headquarters in Northern Virginia that<br>they will share with elements of the DCI Counterterrorism Center and the FBI's Counterterrorism<br>Division.<br>(U//FOUO) In fulfillment of its mission to provide a comprehensive picture of the international<br>terrorist threat, TTIC produces the President's Terrorist Threat Report (PTTR) six days a week;<br>the PTTR has a very limited executive distribution and is one of two documents that the<br>President wants at his breakfast table every day. TTIC also produces on a daily basis the Threat<br>Matrix and two Situational Summaries as well as a variety of other publications on an as-needed<br>basis, such as Intelligence Community assessments/advisories, Spot Commentaries, Senior<br>Executive Intelligence Briefs, and TTIC Special Analysis Reports.<br>(U//FOUO) TTIC has four key initiatives that go to the core of its mission:<br>Information sharing on terrorist threat : TTIC, working with DHS and FBI, has<br>established a joint Program Office to oversee implementation of the March 2003<br>Homeland Security Information Sharing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), signed<br>by the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of Central<br>Intelligence. The challenges of this office include such issues as establishing standards for<br>tear lines, reaching out to non-Intelligence Community agencies, and rethinking reporting<br>standards.<br>TTIC Online : Already extending to over 2,500 users at every major department and<br>agency involved in the war against terrorism, TTIC Online currently operates at a very<br>high classification level and contains TTIC's most sensitive information as well as that<br>produced by other components of the U.S. Government. Over the coming months it will<br>be replicated on less sensitive networks and will ultimately extend to a "sensitive but<br>unclassified" (SBU) version that will allow FBI and DHS to make SBU material available to<br>state and local governments, law enforcement entities, and the private sector.<br>Advanced Analytic Techniques : TTIC is acutely aware of the challenge of correlating<br>data that might be found in finished production, as well as disseminated or nondisseminated reporting, and perhaps even hard drives coming from the caves of<br>Afghanistan. TTIC has recently stood up a team to focus on the advanced analytic<br>techniques necessary to confront the terrorist threat. TTIC is working with the public and<br>private sectors to develop the tools necessary to most efficiently and comprehensively<br>store, retrieve, analyze, and exploit such data, thus providing the capability to look for<br>hidden linkages that simply would not be discoverable otherwise.<br>Identities Database : TTIC is directed by both the DCI Directive 2/4 and the recently<br>signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 6 to "maintain an up-to-date<br>database of known and suspected terrorists accessible to appropriate government<br>officials." TTIC, working with other appropriate government departments and agencies,<br>has been developing such a terrorist identities database that will incorporate all<br>information concerning such individuals' association with international terrorism.

It has<br>an undeniable raison d'etre and a core of dedicated personnel from 16 government agencies as<br>well as the contractor world, who work day and night to fulfill the TTIC mission.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information about TTIC, please contact NSA Liaison Officer <br>@nsa, <br>).<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
