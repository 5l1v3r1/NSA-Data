Since the Gaza Strip is the
centre of the HAMAS organizations popularity and the site of frequent clashes
between HAMAS and FATAH supporters, Israeli forces and Palestinian militants
as well as fighting between the security force organisations this collection is of
critical importance. The PASF organisations are not themselves a military or
terrorist threat to either the US or its allies; however, the groups the PASF
personnel report on include many groups classified as terrorist organisations by
the US government. Now that the Israeli military has withdrawn from Gaza, the
PASF are often our best look at the violence in the region.
