NSA's Counter-BW Program is jointly run by the Research<br>Associate Directorate (RAD) and the Office of Proliferation and Arms Control (S2G), and is<br>funded by the Intelligence Community's Intelligence Technology Innovation Center (ITIC).<br>(S//SI) ITIC had originally provided the funds to NSA to improve machine translation algorithms<br>for the biological weapons target, but in the course of discussions between <br>(RAD) and Dr. David Savignac (CAMT), it became clear that ITIC's requirement could be best<br>met by having the CAMT create appropriate lexicons in the target languages. ITIC concurred to<br>this modified approach and was pleased to learn that the CAMT believed that it could stretch the<br>money to cover lexicon development in more than the original five languages.<br>(S//SI) Once completed, the new lexical information will be immediately integrated into the<br>CAMT's CyberTrans machine translation software to improve automated translation capabilities<br>for this extremely important domain. The lexicons will also be provided to commercial machine<br>translation venders (Systran, Language Weaver and possibly others) for inclusion in software<br>which they supply to the US Government; they will also be released to field sites, training<br>institutions, and the relevant target offices.<br>(C) The CAMT's CyberTrans software is used throughout the Intelligence Community, the<br>Department of Defense, and 2nd and 3rd Parties to translate foreign language text from some<br>sixty languages into English. The biological warfare lexicon project will proceed under the<br>leadership of Dr. Carl Rubino of the CAMT, who is presently overseeing the creation of WMD<br>lexicons in Arabic, Turkish and Uzbek.<br>POC: Dr. Carl Rubino, CAMT/S21212, <br><br>@nsa, <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
