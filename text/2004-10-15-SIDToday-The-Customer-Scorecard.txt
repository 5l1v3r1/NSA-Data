The main element required in making the CSPs better is feedback<br>from the customer. To obtain this feedback, the CRD began a pilot program called the "customer<br>scorecard". This scorecard will be used to determine how the Signals Intelligence Directorate is<br>meeting its customers' product and service needs. More specifically, the purpose of the<br>scorecard is to:<br>Establish a baseline measure of customer satisfaction for all SID customers<br>Identify opportunities for improving and adjusting Customer Support Plans as part of the<br>overall Customer Account Management program<br>Establish a new best practice for periodic assessment on one or more specific<br>improvement ideas<br>Collect overall feedback to ensure stronger customer relationships<br>Demonstrate the importance of listening to the "voice of the customer"<br>(U//FOUO) The scorecard does not replace good account management practices such as<br>capturing customer needs and providing relevant support services; rather, it augments them.<br>The questions on the scorecard have been carefully selected to ensure that the feedback<br>obtained can have a direct impact on areas important to the customer and specific goals that<br>CRD targeted. Thus the scorecard should help us distinguish what is essential to achieve<br>success.<br>(U//FOUO) Each interaction between SID and the customer must add value to the relationship.<br>That is why the interview questionnaire is designed in a thoughtful, conversational and nonthreatening way. The Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) and Account Manager (AM)<br>should be familiar with the customer's current needs and history working with SID. Over time, as<br>customer information becomes more readily accessible, this familiarity will be easy to achieve,<br>but in the meantime SEAMs and AMs should be well prepared not only to discuss the scorecard,<br>but also to capture other customer feedback related to product or service improvement<br>suggestions.<br>(U//FOUO) To view a briefing on the results of the first set of "scorecards" , go to<br>For additional info, see the Customer Gateway homepage .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
