Have you or your management wondered<br>how to best standardize SIGINT production processes no matter where in the U.S. SIGINT<br>System (USSS) they're performed? Help is on the way! SIGINT Policy has a team that is working<br>with mission experts throughout the USSS to re-engineer the USSID system to ensure that it<br>directs today's SIGINT production processes, and that USSIDs are easy to find and use.<br>(U//FOUO) The USSID re-engineering effort started almost two years ago with a focus on<br>providing the doctrine that is the foundation of the USSID system. That doctrine exists in the<br>Cryptologic Doctrine and SIGINT Keystone documents. Now that the Doctrine and Keystone<br>documents are in place, SIGINT Policy is focused on refurbishing and enhancing the detailed<br>directives for the SIGINT production process -- the USSID system.<br>(U//FOUO) USSID 1, " SIGINT Operating Policy ," details the authorities that allow us to legally<br>perform our SIGINT missions, and specifically states that "DIRNSA/CHCSS uses the U.S. Signals<br>Intelligence Directive (USSID) System to control the operations of the USSS." It also declares<br>that only USSIDs, or vehicles authorized in USSIDs, are used to direct SIGINT operations of the<br>USSS.<br>(U//FOUO) USSID 2, " The USSID System ," explains how the USSID system is structured and<br>administered, and details the processes for initiating new USSIDs and for modifying or canceling<br>existing USSIDs. USSID 2 will soon be updated to support the implementation of USSID reengineering, which will make the USSID system more accurate, current, and flexible.<br>(U//FOUO) USSID re-engineering is now underway, and has two main aspects:<br>(U//FOUO) The first is the identification and closure of gaps -- current operational<br>processes that are inadequately covered in USSIDs. For the last six months, the Reengineering Team has consulted with subject matter experts across SID to identify and<br>prioritize major SIGINT processes that need to be addressed in USSIDs. SID Policy and<br>the SID deputy directorates are collaborating to close these gaps, resulting in several<br>new draft USSIDs and revisions of existing USSIDs.<br>(U//FOUO) The second is the proposed implementation of a new structure for<br>organizing USSIDs , to include re-grouping and re-numbering USSIDs to make them<br>easier to locate by subject. Details of the proposal are being briefed to the deputy<br>directorates. If approved, implementation of the new structure will begin as soon as April<br>2005, after an aggressive effort to educate the USSS workforce and coordinate with all<br>concerned organizations to ensure a trouble-free transition. Further details are available<br>at the USSID Re-engineering Web Site .<br>(U//FOUO) The goal of the USSID Re-engineering Team is to ensure that USSIDs are an<br>accurate source of information for governing the SIGINT Enterprise of today and tomorrow from<br>Headquarters to the Extended Enterprise.<br>(U//FOUO) The Re-engineering Team is recruiting additional personnel to spearhead its work on<br>S1 and S2 related USSIDs, and welcomes questions from interested candidates. As reengineering efforts continue, additional information will be disseminated to the NSA/CSS<br>workforce, partners, and customers.
