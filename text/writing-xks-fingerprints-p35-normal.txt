Quick Aside 2: Keyword Scanning

By default keywords in fingerprints can hit in substrings
since for example ‘ndc’ is found within grandchildren.

So this fingerprint

fingerprint(‘cp/pakistan/agencies/ndc’) =

‘NDC’;

Will hit on terms like:

•	grandchildren

•	handcard

•	handcuffs

•	etc.
