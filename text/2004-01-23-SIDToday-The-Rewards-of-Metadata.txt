As<br>one example of this (known as "call chaining"), analysts investigate which phone numbers are<br>being called by targeted phones numbers.<br>(S//SI) What does this tell them? For one, it helps with SIGINT development by yielding new,<br>potentially fruitful, numbers to collect against. It also can shed light on the relationships that<br>exist among a group of people (see a related story on Social Network Analysis ), insights that<br>can have intelligence value. Information chaining can also show the location from which certain<br>calls are being made.**<br>(S//SI) SID's use of this information has yielded concrete results - including playing a role in the<br>capture of "bad guys"! A Counterterrorism analyst used locational information to help steer<br>authorities towards the al-Qaida VIP Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured in Karachi,<br>Pakistan in March 2003. In another incident, analysts identified the cell tower of a handset used<br>by Abu Zubaida, a senior al-Qaida operational coordinator. He was captured in March 2002.<br>(S//SI) NSA's corporate COMINT call event repository is called FASCIA II. It is a huge database<br>that today provides access to metadata records on:<br>telephone<br>wireless<br>billing data<br>media over IP (MoIP)<br>high-powered cordless phone (HPCP)<br>In future, FASCIA II will provide more sources for all of the above, plus INMARSAT and email<br>(also known as DNI) metadata.<br>(S//SI) Currently, the database holds over 85 billion total records, with about 125 million<br>records a day added, making FASCIA II one of the world's largest Oracle databases. It has over<br>48 months' worth of on-line storage. In future, these figures will increase to over 205 million<br>records a day, and storage of 7 years on-line, 3 years archived. In addition, new servers will<br>make the database 300% faster. All of these upgrades must be carried out while keeping the<br>system on-line, since continual access to the data is of such importance to the SIGINT analyst<br>customers, Second Party and Intelligence Community partners.<br>(S//SI) As you can see, information chaining is a real "growth area" for SID. If you have any<br>questions about FASCIA II, contact the Project Manager<br> <br>nsa) in<br>Technology Services.<br>**(S//SI) For more information on information chaining using metadata, contact SIGINT<br>Development's Target Analysis Center .<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
