(U) YRS GEARS UP TO CELEBRATE 40 YEARS

(S//SI//REL) Next year, the Yakima Research Station
will celebrate the 40th anniversary of its Initial
Operating Capability! On 4 May 1973, YRS received
certification and began secure teletype communica-
tions with Ft. Meade over a 75-baud orderwire.

Established under the ECHELON program to collect
and process INTELSAT communications during the
height of the Cold War, the station’s mission has
continually evolved to stay relevant and focused, but YRS has always had a
leading role in enabling the Agency to understand and exploit developing
communications technology. Planning is underway to recognize the four

decades of contributions YRS has made to the
cryptologic enterprise. Please watch The Northwest
Passage and other NSA media venues for news and
events relating to the anniversary celebration in
2013. YRS alumni and friends will be invited both
to share memories of serving at this unique site and
to attend a reunion event in the spring. If you had
a tour at YRS in the last 40 years, or know of
someone who did, please share the news! We
welcome you to share your stories and memories of YRS ~ please use the
following link for our YRS Journal.

(U) DID YOU KNOW?

(U) The three longest floating bridges in the
world are in Washington State. The Governor
Albert D. Rosellini Bridge (formerly Evergreen
Foint Floating Bridge) is the longest, extending

7.580	feet across Washington’s second largest
lake, Lake Washington. Completed in 1963, the
entire bridge spans nearly three miles, totaling

15.580	feet in length. Consisting of a drawspan
in addition to the floating sections, the Rossellini
Bridge is the second floating bridge to cross Lake Washington. The first, Lake
Washington Floating Bridge (today the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge), is
the second longest in the world and was the largest floating structure ever built
at its construction in 1940. It directs Interstate 90, whereas Rosellini Bridge
extends SR 520. When it opened, the Rosellini bridge had an intended daily
capacity of 65,000 vehicles. Today, however, nearly 115,000 vehicles cross the
bridge, creating large rush-hour bottlenecks and prompting the phrase,
“anything but the 520 bridge.”
