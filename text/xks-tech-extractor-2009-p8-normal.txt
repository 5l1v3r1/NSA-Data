How does the Tech Extractor work?

The Tech Extractor works by scanning a list
of keywords against those three contexts
and then tagging the results.

It’s important to note that this is not “filtering
and selection” and we’re not forwarding any
data home

XKS is simply tagging sessions with
meta-data, much like we do with
appids+fingerprints
