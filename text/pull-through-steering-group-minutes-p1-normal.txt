Discussion of PTSG future

The future of ‘pull through’ and the PTSG was discussed in the context of
programmes, themes, product centres, the four box model, evolutionary

within the business was recognised by all as important for continuity, however no
specific conclusions were reached with respect to the relationship between the PTSG

have been proposed in the context of the 4 box model transition processes.

(Ed note: Worthwhile for the PTSG to consider this relationship further more formally)
