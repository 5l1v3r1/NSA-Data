3.	It should be understood that BLACK HOLE is not a queryable repository of data
e.g. It is not possible to select all data for one of your targets. The data is stored
in compressed text files in a series of directories. The data is not databased.
Using the HTTP interface, it is possible to return all data of a certain type with
basic parameters e.g. by date, but that will return all data of the type.

4.	One of the main uses for the TR BLACK HOLE data is as the source of data for
populating key operational Internet profiling tools such as MUTANT BROTH,
KARMA POLICE and SOCIAL ANIMAL. These applications will also be “Tech
Transferred" as Query Focused Datasets (QFD) by TDB-Events as part of the
BLAZING SADDLES project.

5.	The tech-transferred QFDs will be populated from a Buffer repository, which will
hold all QFD data sources for 5 days. In this way the new BLACK HOLE and
QFDs will be independent of each other, and the new BLACK HOLE is removed
from the processing chain.

6.	The following business areas require direct data access to BLACK HOLE data:

. TR

. OPD-GTAC
. OPD-GTE
. GTE-BUDE
. OPD-CRFC
. OPC-TDSD
. CTOR (part of OPIX-IT)

7.	The original TR BLACK HOLE will remain in the TR laboratory for research
purposes only i.e. it will no longer provide direct operational use. See Reference
[a] for more information about the current TR BLACK HOLE.

8.	A general overview of the system being delivered by BLAZING SADDLES can be
found in Appendix A.
