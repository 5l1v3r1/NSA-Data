USSID18/HRA Considerations

XKS Fingerprints may not be USSID18 or HRA
compliant if they are queried on by themselves

For example, we may want to fingerprint the use of
mobile web devices like the IPhone, so that attribute
could be used as part of a more complex query.

But querying for the IPhone fingerprint itself would
be a USSID18 and HRA violation.
