DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL <br><br>(U//FOUO) Addressing Major Gaps and Shortfalls in DA's Capabilities<br>FROM: <br>SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)<br>Run Date: 12/02/2004<br><br>S3 to gather subject-matter experts from across the SIGINT system to think of creative<br>solutions. (U//FOUO)<br>(U//FOUO) In one of my recent Data Acquisition Notes to the Workforce, we talked about<br>various initiatives intended to connect efforts in our line organizations. Today, I want to focus on<br>the new Data Acquisition (DA) Requirements Process.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are at all like me, the term "requirements process" itself does not sound like a<br>tool for creativity and inclusiveness. Nonetheless, that is the goal. This activity is designed to<br>address major gaps and shortfalls in DA capabilities, ones which can't be handled easily at a<br>lower level in the organization. It will shepherd development of creative, cross-organizational<br>strategies for dealing with these issues in an open but disciplined fashion. The resulting plans<br>will be levied on the appropriate organizations for implementation.<br>(U//FOUO) The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC, S3C) will serve as<br>Executive Agent for the Requirements Process. In this capacity, the CSRC will work with<br>appropriate technical leaders to bring together subject-matter experts from across the SIGINT<br>system and our many partnerships to examine capability gaps and develop a range of options.<br>Participants are specifically tasked to be open to input and ideas from as wide a field as makes<br>sense, given the specific problem being addressed. The options they develop will be presented to<br>the DA Leadership Team for final approval. Approved plans will generally involve multiple<br>organizations and will be managed in various ways, depending on complexity and scale.<br>(S//SI) As a pilot project, the first subject-matter experts group, which was assembled in early<br>October, will address the challenges associated with Pick-Your-Own-Number VOIP services . The<br>group has been meeting biweekly to create a strategy to deal effectively with this technology in<br>the SIGINT system. The alternatives and recommendations will be presented to the DA<br>Leadership for approval and tasking. Additional topics are currently being consolidated and will<br>be presented to a board of DA Technical Directors for vetting in early December.<br>(U//FOUO) Formal documentation of requirements and the transparent reporting of the status<br>and progress of their development is an integral element of this disciplined approach. Webenabled applications are the perfect tools for providing visibility into key requirements actions.<br>Even in this early stage, you can view the requirements process online on the CSRC web page<br>"go CSRC."<br>(U//FOUO) Each DA group has invested considerable time and resources in establishing its own<br>requirements processes. The Data Acquisition process is designed to dovetail with, not<br>supersede, the group-level requirements processes. It will dovetail equally well with Extended<br>Enterprise requirements processes throughout the SIGINT system.<br>(U//FOUO) In summary, we hope this will help us bring coordinated SIGINT power to bear on<br>our hardest and most complex problems.
