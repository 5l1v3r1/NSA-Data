How does the Tech Extractor work?

•	The Tech Extractor works by scanning a list of
keywords (or regular expressions) against those three
contexts and then tags the results.

•	This is not “filtering and selection” and were not
forwarding any data home

XKS is simply tagging sessions with meta-data, much
like we do with appids+fingerprints
