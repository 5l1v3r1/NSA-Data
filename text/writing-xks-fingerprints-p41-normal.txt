Fingerprints 101: Variables

•	Variables can be re-used in multiple fingerprints.

•	For example, we could have:
fingerprint (‘cp/pakistan/agencies/ndc’) =
($NDC_terms and $procurement_terms) and not

$spam_defeats;

fingerprint(‘cp/pakistan/angencies/ndc/testing’) =
$NDC_terms and (‘missile launch’ or ‘tactical
radio’);
