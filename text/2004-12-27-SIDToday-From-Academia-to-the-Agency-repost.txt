Here's a story from February 2004... (U)<br>(U) My life changed on 14 July 2003. That was the date of my EOD to NSA as a Language<br>Analyst intern. At 42, I must be one of the oldest interns here, but I wear my Newbie status<br>with pride. You see, I used to be a professor. For thirteen years I taught Greek and Roman<br>Archaeology, Civilization, and History courses and I even had tenure. And as I continued to<br>master those esoteric fields, repeating my lectures and courses semester after semester, I came<br>to realize that I was falling out of love with it, having reached all my goals: I had led student<br>groups to Europe, done research in the British Museum and in Athens, had a Fulbright,<br>published a book, lectured at places like Oxford, Harvard, and Stanford -- all those things which<br>make up a successful academic career. Perhaps it's my mid-life crisis, but I decided to try a new<br>career, one that centers on service and focuses on today's vital issues.<br>(U) My unhappiness as a professor stemmed from academia's traditional boundaries and<br>ordinary ways of operating. In academics, there are no opportunities for faculty to cross-train or<br>transfer to different departments. No NCS exists to sustain our professional development. I don't<br>miss the needless faculty meetings and endless student counseling that drained my energy. I<br>don't miss grading papers, midterms, and finals. I don't miss the highs and lows of lecturing<br>once or twice a day; the rushes of adrenaline and the consequent crashes are replaced by a<br>serenity of intellectual work on real world problems. And oddly, I don't miss thinking about the<br>ancient Greeks and Romans every day -- my attention is drawn to current events in real time.<br>(U) I am excited to serve at NSA at this critical juncture in U.S. history. Now I am immersed in a<br>knowledge-based environment, where continuous learning is facilitated and expected. Crosstraining and flexible tracks are open to me; TDY's and IC-wide opportunities fill my dreams.<br>(U) Think of one of those sad plants in plastic 4 inch containers for sale in August, with its soil<br>dried out, its roots reaching through the holes on the bottom, leaves withered and browned. Call<br>me a deadwood professor if you must, but I know that it was just sheer boredom. On 14 July,<br>NSA transplanted me into its deep soil, where I can now stretch, breathe, be nourished,<br>sustained, and even grow.<br>(U//FOUO) Diane Harris Cline, BA Stanford '83, Ph.D. Princeton '91 AKA <br><br>@nsa<br><br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Are you a new hire?
