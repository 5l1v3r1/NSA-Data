ATTN OF: SID Oversight Compliance
SUBJECT: NSAW SID Intelligence Oversight (IO) Quarterly Report First Quarter Calendar

Year 2012 (1 January 31 March 2012) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
TO: SIGINT Director

 

I. (U) Overview

The attached NSAW SID Intelligence Oversight (IO) Quarterly Report for the First Quarter
Calendar Year 2012 (1 January 31 March 2012) identifies NSAW SID compliance with EC. 12333, 
Regulation Policy 1?23, USSID SP0018, and all related policies and regulations.

Detailed incident narratives are provided in the attached annexes. The number of incidents in
each category and a reference to the annex related to each incident category are contained in the body of the
report.

As part of SID Oversight and Compliance?s (SV) charge to provide comprehensive trends and
analysis information as it pertains to incidents of non?compliance, this Executive Summary provides analysis
and evaluation of incidents reported throughout the current quarter to better address the ?whys? and ?hows?
behind NSAW compliance posture.

Section II, Metrics, has been broken down into several sub?sections: metrics and analysis of
NSAW SID?reported incidents by authority, type, root cause, and organization. Also included is an assessment
of how incidents were discovered methods of discovery) for SID?reported incidents (see Figure 7).

Significant Incidents of Non?compliance and Report Content follow in Sections and IV,
respectively.

Overall, the number of incidents reported during 1QCY12 increased by 11% as compared to the
number of incidents reported during 4QCY11. This included a rise in the number of EC. 12333 incidents, as
well as for incidents across all FISA authorities. The majority of incidents in all authorities were database
query incidents due to human error. Of note, S2 continued to be the NSAW SID organization with the largest
number of reported incidents although S2 experienced an overall decrease in reported incidents. SV
noted an overall improvement in timeliness regarding 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report submissions from the SID
elements.

11. (U) Metrics
a. NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Authority

TO USA, FVEY) Figures 1a-b compares all categories of NSAW SID?reported incidents
(collection, dissemination, unauthorized access, and retention) by Authority for 2QCY11 1QCY12. From
4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an overall increase in incidents of 11%. There was also an increase of 11% for
both E.O. 12333 and FISA incidents. The increase in incidents reported for 1QCY12 was due to an increase in
the number of reported Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) roamer1 incidents, which may be
attributed to an increase in Chinese travel to visit friends and family for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.

FISA Incidents: As re?ected in Figures 1a-b, during 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total
of 195 FISA incidents, 185 of which were associated with unintentional collection. NSAW SID also reported 6
incidents of unintentional dissemination under FISA authority and 4 incidents of unauthorized access to Raw

SIGINT FISA data. Figure 2 illustrates the most common root causes for incidents involving FISA authorities
as determined by SV.

0 63% (123) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to Operator Error as the root cause, and
involved:
0 Resources inaccurate or insufficient research information and/or workload issues 
0 Lack of due diligence failure to follow standard operating procedures) 
0 Human error (21) which encompassed:
Broad syntax no or insufficient limiters defeats parameters) 
I Typographical error 
Query technique understood but not applied and
Incorrect option selected in tool and
0 Training and guidance training issues) (3).

The Resources root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of Operator Error
incidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. Analysis identified that these incidents could be reduced if
had more complete and consistent information available about selectors and/or targets at the time of
tasking and if consistently applied rules for conducting queries.

0 37% (72) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to System Error as the root cause, and
involved:
0 System limitations system lacks the capability to ?push? real?time travel data out to
system/device unable to detect changes in user) 
0 System engineering system/database developed without the appropriate oversight
measures, data ?ow issues, etc.) and,
0 System disruptions glitches, bugs, etc.) (1).

The System Limitations root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of System
Error incidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. The largest number of incidents in the System Limitations
category account for roamers where there was no previous indications of the planned travel. These incidents are
largely unpreventable. Consistent discovery through the Visitor Location Register (VLR) occurs every quarter
and provides with timely information to place selectors into candidate status or detask. Analysis
identified that these incidents could be reduced if removed/detasked selectors more quickly upon
learning that the status of the selector had changed and more regularly monitored target activity. This analysis
indicates that continued research on ways to exploit new technologies and researching the various aspects of
personal communications systems to include GSM, are an important step for NSA to track the travel of
valid foreign targets.

TO USA, FVEY) Delayed Detasking FISA Incidents: As re?ected in Figures 1a-b, during
1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 195 FISA incidents. 19 of the total FISA incidents were
associated with detasking delays. Of the 19 delayed detasking incidents, 12 of these incidents occurred
under NSA FISA Authority, 5 occurred under FAA 702 Authority, occurred under FAA 704
Authority, and 1 occurred under FAA 705(b) Authority. Figure 3a illustrates the detasking delay incidents
versus all other FISA incidents reported during 1QCY12. Figure 3b illustrates the detasking delay incidents by
FISA Authority reported during 1QCY12.

TO USA, FVEY) As depicted in Figures 3a and 3b, of the 19 delayed detasking FISA
incidents, 15 resulted from a failure to detask all selectors, 2 resulted from analyst not detasking
when required, 1 resulted from partner agency error, and 1 (5 resulted from all tasking not terminated
dual route).

b. NSAW SID-reported Collection Incidents by Sub-Type and Authority

Figures 4a-b depicts NSAW SID?reported collection incidents by Authority (E.O. 12333 and
all FISA Authorities), and identifies the primary sub?types for those incidents. An explanation of the more
prominent collection incident sub?types follows the graphs.

Figure 4a: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a 39% increase of database query incidents
under E.O. 12333 Authority. Human Error accounted for 74% of E.O.12333 database query incidents.

TO USA, FVEY) International Transit Switch Collecti0n*: International Transit switches,
FAIRVIEW STORMBREW ORANGEBLOSSOM and SILVERZEPHYR
are Special Source Operations (SSO) programs authorized to collect cable transit traffic passing
through U.S. gateways with both ends of the communication being foreign. When collection occurs with one or
both communicants inside the US, this constitutes inadvertent collection. From 4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an
increase of transit program incidents submitted from 7 to 27, due to the change in our methodology for reporting and
counting of these types of incidents. (*See Annex in 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report for additional details
regarding these incidents.)

Figure 4b: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported an increase of 9% of roamer incidents under
all FISA Authorities. There was also a 260% increase in database query FISA Authority incidents during
1QCY12. Human Error accounted for the majority of all FISA Authorities database query incidents 

Roamers: Roaming incidents occur when valid foreign target selector(s) are active in the US.
Roamer incidents continue to constitute the largest category of collection incidents across E.O. 12333 and FAA
authorities. Roamer incidents are largely unpreventable, even with good target awareness and traffic review,
since target travel activities are often unannounced and not easily predicted.

Other Inadvertent Collection: Other inadvertent collection incidents account for situations
where targets were believed to be foreign but who later turn out to be US. persons and other incidents that do
not fit into the previously identified categories.

TO USA, FVEY) Database Queries: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 115
database query incidents across all Authorities, representing a 53% increase from 4QCY11. E.O. 12333
Authority database query incidents accounted for 84% (97) of the total, and all FISA Authorities database query
incidents accounted for 16% (18).

Figure 5 illustrates the most common root causes for incidents involving database queries as
determined by SV.

0 99% (114) of the 1QCY12 database query incidents are attributed to Operator Error as the root
cause, and involved:
0 Human error (85) which encompassed:

The remaining 1 database query incident can be attributed to System Error as the root cause
and occurred due to a mechanical error with the tool.

Analysis identified that the number of database query incidents could be reduced if 
more consistently applied rules/standard operating procedures (SOPs) for conducting queries.

F) Auditors continue to play an important role in the discovery of database query incidents,
identifying 70 of the 115 reported database query incidents.

TO USA, FVEY) Of the 115 database query incidents reported for 1QCY12, Figure 6 identifies
the database involved and the associated percentage of the total. Databases considered to be Source Systems of
Record (SSR) have been labeled as such.

TO USA, FVEY) Note that the total number of databases involved in the database query

incidents in Figure 6 does not equal the number of database query incidents re?ected in Figure 5 or in the
1QCY12 SID IO Quarterly Report because a database query incident may occur in more than one database.

NSAW SID-reported Incidents Method of Discovery

Figure 7 depicts the most prominent method(s) of discovery for incidents reported by NSAW
SID elements for 1QCY12. As assessment of root causes matures, and as corrective measures are
implemented, identification of how incidents are discovered will provide additional insight into the
effectiveness of those methods.

For 1QCY12, of the 865 reported incidents, 553 were discovered by automated alert.
444, of the 55 3 incidents that were discovered by automated alert occurred via the VLR and other
analytic tools, such as SPYDER, CHALKFUN, and TransX.

c. NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Organization

Figure 8 illustrates the total 1QCY12 NSAW SID?reported incidents by primary SID Deputy
Directorate (DD) level organization. S2, having the largest NSAW SID contingent of reported incidents,
accounted for 89% of the total incidents for the quarter, a proportion consistent with the overall size of the S2
organization. As compared to 4QCY11, S2 experienced an overall 8% reduction in incidents occurrences.

Figure 9 provides a look into S2 (by Product Line) as the NSAW SID organization with the
largest number of reported incidents. For 1QCY12, three Product Lines accounted for 72% of 82?s reported
incidents. These Product Lines were: the and Korea Division (S2B) with 28% of the reported incidents, the
International Security Issues Division (S2C) with 23% of the reported incidents, and the China, and the Office
of Middle East Africa (S2E) with 21% of the incidents. As compared to 4QCY11, this resulted in an increase
of 16% for S2B, a reduction of 35% for 82C, and an increase of 9% for S2E. The number of incidents reported
by the remaining seven Product Lines held relatively steady from 4QCY11 to 1QCY12.

Analysis found that could reduce the number of incidents if there was more
comprehensive research information available at the time of tasking as well as through better use of defeats,
more careful review of data entry to avoid typographical errors and omissions, and by following SOPs more
consistently.

111. (U) Significant Incidents of Non-compliance

F) Business Record (BR) FISA. As of 16 February 2012, NSA determined that approximately
3,032 files containing call detail records potentially collected pursuant to prior BR Orders were retained on a
server and been collected more than five years ago in violation of the 5?year retention period established for
BR collection. Specifically, these files were retained on a server used by technical personnel working with
the Business Records metadata to maintain documentation of provider feed data formats and performed

background analysis to document why certain contain chaining rules were created. In addition to the BR
Page 11 of 13

TOP DFORN

work, this server also contains information related to the STELLARWIND program and ?les which do not
appear to be related to either of these programs. NSA bases its determination that these files may be in
violation of docket number BR. 1 1?191 because of the type of information contained in the ?les eall
detail records}, tlte access to the server by technical personnel who worked with the BB. metadata, and the
listed ?creation date? for the tiles, It is possible that these files contain STELLARWIND data, despite the
creation date. The STELLARWIND data could have been copied to this server, and that process could have
changed the creation date to a tinteframe that appears to indicate that they may contain BR metadata.
