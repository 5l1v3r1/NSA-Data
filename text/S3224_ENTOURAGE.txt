ENTOURAGE

(S//SI//REL) Direction Finding on

HollowPoint Platform

(S//SI//REL) Direction Finding application operating on the HOLLOWPOINT
platform. The system is capable of providing line of bearing for GSM/UMTS/
CDMA2000/FRS signals. A band-specific antenna and laptop controller is needed to
compliment the HOLLOWPOINT system and completes the ground based system.

(S//SI//REL) HOLLOWPOINT SDR Platform and Antenna

(S//SI) The ENTOURAGE application leverages the 4 Software Defined Radio
(SDR) units in the HOLLOWPOINT platform. This capability provides an "Artemis-
like" capability for waveforms of interest (2G,3G,others). The ENTOURAGE
application works in conjunction with the NEBULA active interrogator as part of the
Find/Fix/Finish capabilities of the GALAXY program.
