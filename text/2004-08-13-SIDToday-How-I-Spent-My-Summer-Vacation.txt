This was my thought after attending a career fair in October 2003 and barely<br>being given the time of day by a CIA representative. After waiting for the better portion of an<br>hour to talk to the rep about summer internship opportunities, I walked away having had only a<br>thirty-second conversation and with the image of my resume being tossed into a box.<br>(U) If the CIA couldn't spare a few minutes for a conversation, I would just have to ply my skills<br>elsewhere... Nine months later, were I to meet that representative again, I would buy him<br>dinner for blowing me off that day.<br>(U) Irritated by my useless trip to the career fair, I went looking online for summer<br>opportunities. With a background in computer science and mathematics, I knew one institution<br>that might offer me a position was the NSA. At that point, I knew that the NSA was a secretive<br>government agency that utilized the work of mathematicians to "make and break codes." Upon<br>reading of the Director's Summer Program (DSP) and its summer research positions for<br>college students, I decided to put in an application. After the long clearance process, and<br>surviving a few cuts, I was offered a spot in the DSP.<br>(U) So here I am, a summer intern at the NSA. I've found the experience offered by the past<br>two months to be one of the most exciting and enriching of my entire life. Though I've done<br>research throughout my time at <br>, none of the problems I've worked on have<br>possessed the importance of those I've seen in the DSP. The fact that the work I do in the DSP<br>could possibly help our nation save lives is both sobering and fulfilling. The opportunity to work<br>here means that I no longer have to sit by while events unfold across the globe. Instead, in the<br>DSP, I have the chance to make a contribution to the safety of our nation. It's an incredible<br>responsibility, but one that every person at the NSA has chosen to take on, and I am proud to<br>share that responsibility, even if only for a summer.<br>(U) At the end of my term here, I'll have learned math, made friends, and made a contribution<br>to something important, maybe even something that will save lives down the road. I've taken<br>the skills I've learned during my research at <br> and applied them to real-world problems<br>with important solutions. I'll take back to <br> new skills, knowledge, and confidence in my<br>ability to be a contributing member of a team.<br>(U//FOUO) Read more about the Director's Summer Program in today's edition of NSA Daily .<br>Also, for insights from an intelligence analysis summer intern, see the recent SIDtoday story .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"></p>
