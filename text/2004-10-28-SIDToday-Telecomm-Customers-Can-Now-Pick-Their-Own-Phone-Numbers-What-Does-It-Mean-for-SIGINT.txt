In<br>fact, people can now choose any phone number they wish, regardless of where in the world they<br>live. This phenomenon, known as Pick-Your-Own-Number (or PYON) has some major<br>ramifications for SIGINT collection.<br>(C//SI) Although traditional phone lines are still operating on a country-based telephone<br>numbering system, VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) services are not. This means that VoIP<br>service providers (e.g. Vonage, FreeWorld Dialup, Packet8, etc.) can allow users to pick their<br>own number, usable anywhere. Such services have experienced skyrocketing popularity in<br>recent years: for example, Vonage had 7,700 subscribers at the end of 2002; by May 2004, it<br>had 155,000 subscribers, and was adding 20,000 new subscribers a month! In addition,<br>traditional telephone companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon are now offering VoIP services.<br>(U//FOUO) PYON services generally use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and require a highspeed internet connection, plus either 1) an analog telephone adapter, 2) a SIP phone, or 3) a<br>PC/laptop. Beyond that, however, "pick-your-own number" services operate differently from<br>provider to provider - one solution does not fit all. Most providers allow customers to have an<br>unlimited number of "virtual" phone numbers, of mixed area and country codes.<br>(TS//SI) So what does all this mean for collecting SIGINT? With mobility and phone services<br>available today, the location of a target can no longer be reliably determined based on<br>the phone number -- a fundamental change. (Theoretically, Usama bin Laden could be using a<br>U.S.-based number while located in Afghanistan!) This, in turn, complicates collection<br>because of USSID-18 prohibitions on targeting U.S. communications... how can it be determined<br>if the target is in the U.S. or abroad? And even if the target is known to be abroad, VoIP may fall<br>into a gray area due to the U.S. location of servers and numbers.<br>(TS//SI) The FBI and FCC have mandated that the Communications Assistance for Law<br>Enforcement Act (CALEA) be expanded to include Internet services, including VoIP. CALEA states<br>that telecommunications providers must enable wiretapping by law enforcement agencies. Such<br>activities are outside of NSA's charter, but we may have an opportunity to partner with law<br>enforcement -- i.e. the FBI -- on collection, selection, filtering, and analysis. In addition, some<br>commercially available products have recently been launched to help VoIP providers comply with<br>CALEA. Many regulatory issues still have to be resolved, both in the United States and abroad.<br>(TS//SI) In short, Pick-Your-Own-Number voice over IP has the potential to change the way that<br>we communicate, and will definitely change how NSA does business.<br>(TS//SI) For more information on this subject, see the following:<br>Target Technology Trends Report on "Pick Your Own" Voice over IP Services by <br>, and<br>Technical Report "Pick Your Own Phone Number" VoIP Services by <br>Media over IP Page: "go mop"<br><br>, T3C<br>, R/SRP<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
