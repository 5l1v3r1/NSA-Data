While we have invested signi?cant analytic and collection
effort of our own to ?nd and exploit these communications, the dif?culties we face in
obtaining regular and reliable access to such communications impacts on our ability to detect
and prevent terrorist acts and diminishes our capacity to protect the life and safety of
Australian citizens and these of our close friends and allies.

We have enjoyed a long and very productive partnership with NSA in obtaining minimised
access to United States warranted collection against our highest value terrorist targets in
Indonesia. This access has been critical to efforts to disrupt and contain the operational
capabilitics of terrorists in our region as highlighted by the recent arrest of fugitive Bali
bomber Umar Patch.

We would very much welcome the opportunity to estend that partnership with NSA to cover
the increasing number of Australians involved in international estretnist activities in
particular Australians involved with AQAP.
