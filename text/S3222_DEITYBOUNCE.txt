ANT Product Data

(TS//SI//REL) DEITYBOUNCE provides software application persistence on Dell
PowerEdge servers by exploiting the motherboard BIOS and utilizing System
Management Mode (SMM) to gain periodic execution while the Operating System
loads.

(TS//SI//REL) This technique supports multi-processor systems with RAID hardware
and Microsoft Windows 2000, 2003, and XP. It currently targets Dell PowerEdge
1850/2850/1950/2950 RAID servers, using BIOS versions A02, A05, A06, 1.1.0,
1.2.0, or 1.3.7.

(TS//SI//REL) Through remote access or interdiction, ARKSTREAM is used to re-
flash the BIOS on a target machine to implant DEITYBOUNCE and its payload (the
implant installer). Implantation via interdiction may be accomplished by non-
technical operator though use of a USB thumb drive. Once implanted,
DEITYBOUNCE’s frequency of execution (dropping the payload) is configurable and
will occur when the target machine powers on.
