The fine Palladian house, the<br>country residence of the UK Foreign Secretary, dates back to 1630. It is set in 27 acres of<br>gardens, within an estate of 3,000 acres, and is located 23 miles south of London, in the Kent<br>countryside.<br>(U) While only 1 &amp; 1/2days long, and focused on only a few specific issues, the JMR can be<br>considered the year's most senior cryptologic strategic planning conference between the UK and<br>US. It is complemented by a broad range of detailed UKUSA planning conferences conducted by<br>various mission and support staffs throughout the year. This year, more than 20 senior leaders<br>from across NSA and GCHQ participated -- including DIRNSA and DIR GCHQ, the mission<br>directors for SIGINT and IA, senior general counsels, and senior technology/capability providers.<br>(U) The results of the conference were quite expansive, and may be characterized as follows:<br>Broad agreement that the relationship remains strong across SIGINT, IA, and<br>enabling/support functions;<br>Consensus that our respective modernization programs are better-connected this year<br>than last -- and commitment to ensure still further improvement;<br>Agreement to pilot one or more initiatives aimed at exercising the US commitment to<br>expanded information sharing with the UK;<br>An understanding that change is a fact of life (whether that means the mission dispersion<br>now underway by NSA or the possibility of security community changes attendant to<br>pending US legislation) and that NSA and GCHQ must work hard to keep one another<br>apprised and well connected throughout (actually one of NSA's Special US Liaison Officer,<br>London's key responsibilities);<br>A validation of the common cause that joins our two nations and their cryptologic<br>organizations -- the Directors will sign a statement to this effect as a component of the<br>formal conference proceedings; and<br>Strengthened connections between NSA and GCHQ senior leadership that will enable<br>greater UKUSA collaboration across the coming year.<br>*(U) Notes: <br>GCHQ, the Government Communications Headquarters, is based in Cheltenham, England <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
