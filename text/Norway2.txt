l he main focus will be to address a
request from the partner for advice on coping with the growing volumes of
SIGINT data they are able to access. The overarching goal of this interaction is
to maximize mission benefit of NIS accesses by enabling the partner to exploit
those accesses more effectively from an analytic perspective. NSA is prepared to
advise NIS on technology investments they can make over the next five years.
NIS has received a four-fold increase (approximately US$100M) in their budget
to support this effort.
