    "doc_text": "TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nNational Security\nAgency/Central Security\nService\n\n8 April 2013\n\nInformation Paper\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) Subject: NSA Intelligence Relationship with\nSaudi Arabia\n(U) Introduction\n(TS//SI//NF) Since the first Gulf War in 1991, NSA/CSS has had a very limited\nSIGINT relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The SIGINT\nrelationship has been solely with the Ministry of Defense, Radio Reconnaissance\nDepartment (MOD RRD) which is the first of three ministry-level organizations\nthat have a role in the defense and security of the Kingdom. The NSA/CSS\nSIGINT relationship with the MOD RRD is a complex and challenging one that,\nafter several years of stagnation, is experiencing a period of rejuvenation.\nNSA/CSS is in the process of modernizing the MOD RRD High Frequency\nDirection Finding (HFDF) capability that assists in the monitoring of Iranian\nmilitary threats to KSA. NSA/CSS' Middle East/Africa (MEA) and\nCounterterrorism (CT) Product Lines provide threat warning against terrorist\ntargets and targets of interest to the KSA, specifically, intelligence related to\nHuthi conflicts along the Saudi/Yemen border.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) On 11 December 2012, the Director of National\nIntelligence (DNI) approved expansion of NSA's Third Party SIGINT relationship\nwith Saudi Arabia to include the Saudi Ministry of Interior's (MOI) Technical\nAffairs Directorate (TAD). Prior to receiving DNI's approval of the relationship and\nunder the auspices of CIA's relationship with the MOI's Mabahith (General\nDirectorate for Investigations, equivalent to FBI), NSA had been collaborating\nwith TAD since February 2011 on a sensitive access initiative. This capability is\nfocused on internal security and terrorist activity on the Arabian Peninsula. With\nthe approval of the Third Party SIGINT relationship, NSA/CSS intends to provide\ndirect analytic and technical support to TAD.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Lastly, using the Foreign Release Process,\nNSA/CSS shares threat warning and terrorist lead information produced by the\nCounterterrorism Product Line with the CIA Station in Riyadh to pass to CIA's\nintelligence partner the KSA Ministry of Interior Directorate of Investigations,\nMabahith.\n\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20130408\nDeclassify On: 20380408\nTOP SECR ET//SI//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n(U) Key Issues\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) MOD RRD is interested in expanding the\nrelationship with NSA/CSS. The MOD RRD seeks signals analysis equipment\nupgrades, decryption capabilities and advanced training on a wide range of\ntopics. While NSA/CSS is able to respond to many of their requests, some must\nbe denied due to the fact that they place sensitive SIGINT equities at risk.\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA/CSS leadership anticipates a spring 2013 visit to Saudi Arabia\nto meet with TAD leadership to discuss current and future initiatives of mutual\ninterest under the new relationship construct. NSA's primary goals for the\npartnership are:\n1) (S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) to leverage Saudi Arabia's strategic location\nand unique access to communications - e.g. al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula\n(AQAP) terrorist activity currently not accessible by other means, and\n2) (TS//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) to facilitate the Saudi government's ability\nto utilize SIGINT to locate and track individuals of mutual interest within Saudi\nArabia.\n(U) What NSA Provides to Partner\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) NSA/CSS provides technical advice on SIGINT topics\nsuch as data exploitation and target development to TAD as well as a sensitive\nsource collection capability.\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) NSA/CSS provides a sensitive decryption service to\nthe Ministry of Interior against terrorist targets of mutual interest.\n\n(U) What Partner Provides to NSA\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) NSA leverages MOD RRD access to remote\ngeography in the Arabian Gulf but provides no finished SIGINT reporting to\nNSA/CSS, however; they have provided unencrypted collection against the IRGC\nQODS Maritime Force targets of mutual interest from their collection system\n\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) TAD provides sensitive accessio unique collection\ncontaining AQAP terrorist targets of mutual interest.\n\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20130408\nDeclassify On: 20380408\nTOP SECR ET//SI//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n(U) Success Stories\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) NSA's work with TAD on a sensitive access has\nshown early promise in producing SIGINT of value to the CT product line.\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) A modernized HFDF sensor and HFDF antenna\nsystem was installed in September 2012 at a MOD RRD location new Riyadh.\nThis HFDF system replaces a legacy sensor that has been inoperable for an\nextended period of time and will significantly improve NSA's regional HFDF\narchitecture.\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SAU) MOD RRD supported a Quick R e a c t i o r ^ a p a b i ^\nthe Arabian Gulf in response to a potential threat from IRGC QODS Maritime\nForce. A sustained collection platform is planned for deployment in May 2013.\n(U) Problems/Challenges with the Partner\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The MOD RRD would like to move expeditiously in\ntheir modernization efforts, to include the acquisition of additional SIGINT\ncapabilities. NSA/CSS is cautiously moving forward with this partner and is not\nnecessarily ready to move forward with initiatives that expose sensitive NSA/CSS\nSIGINT equities. This difference in strategic direction will sometimes be\nproblematic and cause tension within the partnership.\n(S//SI//NF) NSA/CSS has agreed to coordinate collection operations in Saudi\nArabia with Chief of Station of Riyadh in an effort to protect unilateral HUMINT\nassets from scrutiny.\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA/CSS does not expect the new relationship with TAD to usurp or\nnegatively impact NSA/CSS' existing relationship with the Ministry of Defense\nRadio Reconnaissance Department (MOD RRD), as MOD RRD does not have\nsimilar access to internal Saudi telecommunications.\n\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Prepared by:\nSaudi Arabian Desk Officer\nForeign Affairs Directorate.

The TSC was\nestablished by the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), and in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of\nHomeland Security, and the then Director of Central Intelligence for the Intelligence\nCommunity (IC). The TSC is supported by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC),\nthe Department of State (DOS), the Department of Homeland Security (DIIS), the IC, the FBI,\nLaw Enforcement Agencies, Regulatory Agencies and Diplomatic Bureaus. The TSC has\ncreated and maintains the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) or Terrorist Watchlist to serve\nas the U.S. Government's consolidated watchlist for TERRORISM SCREENING INFORMATION.\n\n1.2\n\nwatchlisting process supports the U.S. Government's efforts to combat\nconsolidating the U.S. Government's Terrorist Watchlist in the TSDB; (2)\nhelping SCREENERS and intelligence agencies accurately identify individuals on the Terrorist\nWatchlist; (3) providing SCREENERS with information to help them respond appropriately\nduring ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS; and, (4) subsequently collecting\ninformation about the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST for use in assessing threats and\nconducting investigations.2 The collected information may be incorporated into the Terrorist\nIdentities Datamart Environment (TIDE) and TSDB to enhance the records of KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS and may be made available to the wider watchlisting and screening\ncommunities. Today, the TSDB also includes information about certain foreign nationals who\nare associated with TERRORISM, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, or KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST(S)\nbut for whom there is insufficient DEROGATORY INFORMATION to be independently\nwatchlisted. This may include certain immediate family members of KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORISTS, or known associates of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. These additional\ncategories of records (also known as exceptions to the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard) are\nmaintained to support immigration and screening activities primarily conducted by DOS and\nDHS. 3\n\nThe current\n\nTERRORIST\n\nTERRORISM\n\nby:\n\n(1)\n\n' See Appendix 1, Definitions for words or phrases appearing in all capitalized letters throughout this Watchlisting\nGuidance.\nA SCREENF.R is a Department or Agency that is authorized to conduct TERRORISM screening to determine if an\nindividual is a possible match to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the TSDB. The term \"SCRF.ENER\" is used\nthroughout this document as a general reference to a government official who compares an individual's information\nwith information in the T S D B to determine if an individual is in the T S D B . Certain SCREENERS have components\nwhich perform both screening and law enforcement duties and law enforcement officials w h o engage in such activities\nmay normally describe their targeting or other actions in this context as other than \"screening.\" For ease of reference,\ngovernment officials who compare an individual's information with information in the TSDB will be referred to in the\nGuidance as \"SCREENERS.\" The internal guidance set forth herein is not intended to create or confer any rights,\nprivileges, or benefits in any matter, case, or proceeding. See United Stales v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741.\nSee Chapter 3, Section V, infra, for more details. Aside from these limited exceptions, references to the T S D B in this\nWatchlisting Guidance denote the TSDB as containing information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 5\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.3\n\nThis Watchlisting Guidance has been developed to help standardize the watchlisting\ncommunity's nomination and screening processes. It is important to remember, however, that\nwatchlisting is not an exact science. There are inherent limitations in any primarily namebased system and analytic judgments may differ regarding whether subjective criteria have\nbeen met. Given these realities, the U.S. Government's watchlisting process attempts to\nsafeguard the American people from a TERRORIST attack while safeguarding privacy, civil\nrights and civil liberties.\n\n1.4\n\nThus, when reasonable minds could disagree on a record, a NOMINATOR will make a\ndetermination in favor of sending the nomination to NCTC for consideration and additional\nreview. The TSC has the final decision authority regarding watchlisting determinations and\nwill add an individual's name to the TSDB, consistent with TSC Actions and Processes as\nfurther described in Paragraph 1.56.\n\nII.\n\nWATCHLISTING AUTHORITIES\n1.5\n\nOn September 16, 2003, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6\n(HSPD-6), which directed the Attorney General to \"establish an organization to consolidate\nthe U.S. Government's approach to TERRORISM SCREENING and provide for the appropriate\nand lawful use of TERRORIST INFORMATION in screening processes.\"4 TERRORIST\nINFORMATION was specifically defined to mean \"information about individuals known or\nappropriately suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for,\nin aid of, or related to TERRORISM.\" HSPD-6 also directed the heads of Executive\nDepartments and Agencies to provide to NCTC on an on-going basis, \"all appropriate\nTERRORIST INFORMATION in their possession, custody, or control,\" to the extent permitted by\nlaw.\n\n1.6\n\nThe intent of HSPD-6 was to consolidate all TERRORISM INFORMATION at the Terrorist Threat\nIntegration Center (TTIC) - whose functions were assumed by NCTC^ - in a classified\ndatabase that would then extract Unclassified, For Official Use Only (U//FOUO) TERRORIST\nIDENTIFIERS for passage to the new organization created by the Attorney General. Thus,\nconcurrent with the issuance of HSPD-6, the TSC was established via the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding on the Integration and Use of Screening Information to Protect Against\nTerrorism {TSC MOU), which was signed by the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State\nand Homeland Security, and the Director of Central Intelligence (on behalf of the IC).6\n\n\nSee Appendix 2, HSPD-6.\n\n\nSee FN 8, infra.\n\n\" See Appendix 3, TSC MOU\\ see also Appendix 4, Addendum B to the TSC MOU. In 2004, the Secretaries of State,\nTreasury, and Defense also became signatories to the Memorandum of Understanding between the Intelligence\n\nCommunity, Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security Concerning Information\nSharing, dated March 4, 2003 (Information Sharing MOU). Hy doing so, they agreed that all provisions of the TSC\nMOU and the Information Sharing MOU apply to all entities that are or become a part of their respective Departments.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 6\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.7\n\nUnder HSPD-6, consistent with the U.S. Constitution and applicable laws, including those\nprotecting the rights of all Americans, the TSC was to develop and maintain an unclassified\ndatabase containing the most thorough, accurate, and current identity information possible\nabout KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. The TSC created the TSDB to meet these goals.7\nThe TSDB is also known as the Terrorist Watchlist. The TSDB receives TERRORIST\nIDENTIFIERS from two sources: NCTC's TIDE provides information concerning KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED international TERRORISTS and the TSC's Terrorist Review and Examinations Unit\n(TREX) provides the identities of KNOWN or SUSPECTED domestic TERRORISTS who have no\nlink to international TERRORISM. NCTC's TIDE contains identifying and substantive\nDEROGATORY INFORMATION on KNOWN or SUSPECTED international TERRORISTS and the FBI's\nSentinel system contains supporting information regarding purely domestic TERRORISTS.\n\n1.8\n\nPursuant to Paragraph (2) of HSPD-6, the NCTC is mandated to \"provide [TSC] with access\nto all appropriate information or intelligence in the [NCTC's] custody, possession, or control\nthat [TSC] requires to perform its functions.\" NCTC fulfills this function by providing TSC's\nTSDB with U//FOUO information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS from NCTC's\nTIDE and by providing access to TIDE Online, a read-only copy of the TIDE database, to\nthose in the watchlisting community who require access.\n\n1.9\n\nNCTC's establishment by the President was codified by section 1021 of the Intelligence\nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).8 Pursuant to IRTPA, NCTC shall\n\"serve as the central and shared knowledge bank on KNOWN and SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and\ninternational terror groups.\" In addition, NCTC \"may, consistent with applicable law, the\ndirection of the President, and guidelines referred to in [the statute], receive intelligence\npertaining exclusively to domestic counterterrorism from any Federal, State, or local\ngovernment or other source necessary to fulfill its responsibilities and retain and disseminate\nsuch intelligence.\"9\n1.9.1\n\nAll Departments and Agencies arc required to provide NCTC with all T E R R O R I S M\nI N F O R M A T I O N . Due to the amount of information involved, only a subset of this\ninformation is provided in the NCTC prescribed format designed to facilitate direct\ningestion into the TIDE. N O M I N A T I N G D E P A R T M E N T S and A G E N C I E S , however, should\nremain focused on reviewing and watchlisting TERRORISM I N F O R M A T I O N from datasets\nmost likely to contain information about K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D T E R R O R I S T S .\n\nAddendum B to the TSC MOV, which superseded Addendum A, incorporates by reference all provisions of the\nInformation Sharing MOU. See Appendix 5.\nThe TSDB consolidates the U.S. Government's TERRORISM screening and lookout databases into a single integrated\nTERRORIST identities database.\nNCTC initially was created by Executive Order 13354 (August 27, 2004) to serve as the primary organization in the\nU.S. Government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the U.S. Government\npertaining to TERRORISM and counterterrorism, excepting purely domestic counterterrorism information. Executive\nOrder 13354 was revoked by Executive Order 13470 (July 30, 2008) after NCTC was codified in IRTPA section 1021.\nIn addition to the provision of domestic KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS directly to the TSC, the T S C ' s TREX unit\nalso provides the identities of international KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS to N C T C for inclusion in TIDE.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 7\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.10 On August 27, 2004, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 11\n(HSPD-11), which \"builds upon HSPD-6,\" to enhance TERRORLST-related screening to more\neffectively detect and interdict SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. HSPD-11\ndefines \"SUSPECTED TERRORISTS\" as \"individuals known or reasonably suspected to be or have\nbeen engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM . . .\na n d TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\"\n\n1.11 To enhance information sharing, another key component of the consolidated terrorist\nwatchlisting system, the President issued Executive Order 13388, which provides that the\nhead of each Agency that possesses or acquires TERRORISM INFORMATION shall promptly give\naccess to that information to the head of cach other Agency that has counterterrorism\nfunctions. 10\n1.12 On June 5, 2008, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 (HSPD24) to further build upon the TERRORIST screening policies announced in HSPD-6 and HSPDI I to protect the nation from TERRORISTS by enhancing the use of biometrics. In HSPD-24,\nthe President directed that \". . . agencies, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, make\navailable to other agencies all biomctric and associated biographic and contextual information\nassociated with persons for whom there is an articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion\nthat they pose a threat to national security (emphasis added). HSPD-24 underscores the\nvalue of biometrics in achieving effective TERRORISM screening and emphasizes the need for a\nlayered approach to identification and screening of individuals, as no single mechanism is\nsufficient.\n1.13 The relevant TERRORISM screening Presidential Directives use words and phrases to describe a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST subject to TERRORIST screening without defining them:\n\"TERRORIST INFORMATION\" (HSPD-6), \"TERRORISM\" (HSPD-6), \"appropriately suspected\"\n(HSPD-6), \"reasonably suspected\" (HSPD-11), and \"articulable and reasonable basis for\nsuspicion\" (HSPD-24). Thus, previous watchlisting guidance supplied definitions of key\nterms and the standard that would apply to terrorist watchlisting decisions.\n1.14 Neither HSPD-6 nor HSPD-11 defines \"TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\" While\nfederal law contains numerous definitions of \"terrorism\" \" , for watchlisting purposes under\nthis Guidance, \"TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\" combine elements from various\nfederal definitions and are considered to:\n1.14.1\n\ninvolve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure\n\n\nSee Appendix 6, Executive Order 13388.\nSee 50 U.S.C. 1801(c) (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) definition of \"international terrorism\");\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 2l2(a)(3)(B)(iii) [8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii)] (defining \"terrorist activity\");\nINA § 212(a)(3)(B)(iv) [8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)] (defining to \"engage in terrorist activity\"); 18 U.S.C. 2331(1)\n(defining \"international terrorism\"); 18 U.S.C. 2332(b) (defining \"federal crime of terrorism\"); Executive Order 13224,\n66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (September 23, 2001) (defining \"terrorism\").\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 8\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nwhich may be a violation of U.S. law, or may have been, if those acts were committed in\nthe United States; and,\n1.14.2\n\nappear to be intended—\n\n1.14.2.1\n\nto intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n\n1.14.2.2\n\nto influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or,\n\n1.14.2.3 to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination,\nkidnapping, or hostage-taking.\n1.15 This includes activities that facilitate or support TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES such\nas providing a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other\nmaterial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical,\nbiological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training for the commission of an act of\nTERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY.\n1.16 HSPD-24 speaks in terms of \"articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion\" to describe a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST who should be watchlistcd and represents the President's\nmost recent explanation concerning U.S. policy regarding the individuals who pose a threat to\nnational security and should be screened to better protect the American people. Accordingly,\nthat standard has been adopted and is clarified in this Watchlisting Guidance in Chapter 3,\nSection II.\n1.17 On December 16, 2005, in accordance with section 1016 of IRTPA, the President issued a\nMemorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies prescribing the\nguidelines and requirements in support of the creation and implementation of the Information\nSharing Environment (ISE). In Guideline 5 of that Memorandum, the President directed, as\nhe had earlier in Executive Order 13353 ' 2 , that the information privacy rights and other legal\nrights of Americans must be protected and that guidelines be developed and approved to\nensure that \"such rights are protected in the development and use of the ISE.\" In December\n2006, the President approved for issuance the ISE Privacy Guidelines by the Program\nManager.13\n1.18 A second addendum to the TSC MOV, Addendum B l 4 , which supplements and incorporates\nby reference all provisions of the TSC MOU, superseded Addendum A and became effective\non January 18, 2007. The Directors of National Intelligence, NCTC, and the TSC joined as\nsignatories in Addendum B. Paragraph 7 of Addendum B introduces the term TERRORIST\nIDENTIFIERS to more clearly describe the type of TERRORIST identity elements that are deemed\nSee Executive Order 13353, Establishing the President's Board on Safeguarding Americans' Civil Liberties (August\n27, 2004).\nSee Guidelines to Ensure that Information Privacy and other Legal Rights of Americans are Protected in the\nDevelopment and Use of the Information Sharing Environment (December, 2006).\nSee Appendix 4, Addendum B to the TSC MOU.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 9\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nU//FOUO, without regard to the classification of the source material from which it is drawn.\ninclude those listed in Addendum B (i.e., names and aliases; dates of\nbirth; places of birth; unique identifying numbers; passport information; countries of origin\nand nationality; physical identifiers; known locations; photographs or renderings; fingerprints\nor other biometric data; employment data; license plate numbers; and any other TERRORIST\nIDENTIFIERS that ORIGINATORS specifically provide for passage to the TSC). For example,\nemail addresses and phone numbers are increasingly useful for screening purposes.\nORIGINATORS should mark email addresses and phone numbers as U//FOUO whenever\npossible and pass these TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to NCTC to forward to the TSC for inclusion\nin TSDB. ORIGINATORS are encouraged to provide all relevant and unclassified information,\nto include social media information when appropriate.\nTERRORIST IDENTIFIERS\n\nIII.\n\nCONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITIES\n1.19 First Amendment. First Amendment protected activity alone shall not be the basis for\nnominating an individual for inclusion on the Terrorist Watchlist.15 The following arc\nexamples of protected Constitutional activities:\n1.19.1 Free Speech. The exercise of free speech, guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution,\nincludes more than simply speaking on a controversial topic in the town square. It\nincludes such symbolic or other written, oral and expressive activities as carrying\nplacards in a parade, sending letters to a newspaper editor, wearing a tee shirt with a\npolitical message, placing a bumper sticker critical of the President on one's car, and\npublishing books or articles. The common thread in these examples is conveying a\npublic message or an idea through words or deeds. Speech that may be repugnant to\nideas of the majority may still be protected by the U.S. Constitution. For the purpose of\nthis Watchlisting Guidance, the right of protected free speech under the U.S.\nConstitution applies to U.S. PERSONS wherever they are located and to non- U.S. PERSONS\nlocated inside the United States. The right of protected free speech, however, is not\nunlimited and may not extend to some lawless action.\n1.19.2 Exercise of Religion. The free exercise of religion covcrs any form of worship of a\ndeity - even forms that are not widely known or practiccd - as well as the right not to\nworship any deity. Protected religious exercise also extends to dress that is worn or food\nthat is eaten for a religious purpose, attendance at a facility used for religious practice,\nobservance of the Sabbath, raising money for evangelical or missionary purposes, and\nproselytizing.\n1.19.3 Freedom of the Press. Freedom of the press includes such matters as reasonable\naccess to news-making events, the making of documentaries, and the posting of \"blogs.\"\n\nThe First Amendment does not apply to non-u.S. PERSONS outside the United States. Before submitting nominations,\nNOMINATORS may consult with their Department or Agency counsel to determine whether a specific person is a U.S.\nPERSON and whether the questioned activity is entitled to First Amendment protection.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage| 10\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.19.4 Freedom of Peaceful Assembly. Freedom of peaceful assembly, often called the\nright to freedom of association, includes gathering with others to protest government\naction, or to rally or demonstrate in favor of, or in opposition to, a social cause. The\nright to peaceful assembly includes more than just public demonstrations - it includes,\nas well, the posting of group websites on the Internet, recruiting others to a lawful cause,\nmarketing a message, and fundraising, which all are protected First Amendment\nactivities if they are conducted in support of an organizational, political, religious, or\nsocial cause.\n1.19.5 Petition the Government for Redress of Grievances. The right to petition the\ngovernment for redress of grievances includes, for example, writing letters to Congress,\ncarrying a placard outside the city hall that delivers a political message, recruiting others\nto one's cause, and lobbying Congress or an Executive Agency for a particular result.\n1.20 Equal Protection. The Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides in part that:\n\"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall ... deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that\nthis applies as well to the official acts of U.S. Government personnel. Nominations, therefore,\nshall not be based solely on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation. Any\nactivities relating to this Guidance that are based solely on such considerations are invidious\nby definition, and therefore, unconstitutional.\nIV.\n\nWATCHLISTING POLICIES\n1.21 Watchlisting Disclosures. The general policy of the U.S. Government is to neither confirm\nnor deny an individual's watchlist status. In addition to the provisions in Addendum B to the\nTSC MOU, which require NOMINATOR approval before TSDB information can be used in any\nprocess that might result in public disclosure, the 2007 Memorandum of Understanding on\nTerrorist Watchlist Redress Procedures (Redress MOU)16 requires SCREENERS lo contact the\nTSC if it receives a request for information or records that might reveal an individual's\nwatchlist status. Approval would also be required from any entity which provided\ninformation used by a NOMINATOR during a nomination. Per the Redress MOU, ORIGINATING\nand NOMINATING AGENCIES are obligated to support SCREENER determinations - both at the\nadministrative level and in litigation - and provide appropriate information, including\nunclassified substitutes as necessary. TSC, in conjunction with NCTC, the NOMINATORS, and\nthe Department of Justice (DOJ), as appropriate, will ensure that representations regarding an\nindividual's potential watchlist status are properly coordinated and approved.\n1.22 Legal or Use Restrictions. Because information in the TSDB comes overwhelmingly from\nintelligence sources and methods or sensitive law enforcement techniques, Paragraph 12 of\n\n\nSee Appendix 8, Redress\n\nMOU.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage| 11\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nAddendum B to the TSC MOU1' requires that any recipient of information from the TSDB\nseeking to use TERRORIST identity information in any legal or administrative process or\nproceeding obtain NOMINATOR approval before doing so. Approval from the entity which\nprovided the information, if other than the NOMINATOR, is also required. Additionally,\ninformation from Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (F1SA) collections may only be used\nin a proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General. Therefore, any\nSCREENER seeking to use TSDB information in any process or proceeding must contact TSC\nso that TSC can assist in obtaining approval from the NOMINATOR, owner of the information,\nor Attorney General, as required.\n1.23 In addition to the foregoing restrictions, there are restrictions on sharing information with\nforeign governments. Any TERRORIST IDENTIFIER (as described in Addendum B to the TSC\nMOU) will be deemed U//FOUO and shared with the watchlisting community and foreign\ngovernments for watchlisting purposes pursuant to the terms of the TSC MOU. Accordingly,\nNOMINA TORS should include, as appropriate, TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS in documents that contain\nnon-releasable warnings (e.g., a report is not releasable to xxx/yyy/zzz countries), unless the\nTERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are restricted by some other authority that limits dissemination. If U.S.\nPERSON information is otherwise authorized for release to the foreign government, the nonreleasable warning is disabled to allow dissemination of the information.\nV.\n\nWATCHLISTING STANDARD: IDENTIFYING AND SUBSTANTIVE\nDEROGATORY CRITERIA\n1.24 Before a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is added to the Terrorist Watchlist, TSC reviews\nthe nomination to determine whether it meets the following minimum identifying criteria and\nminimum substantive derogatory criteria for inclusion in the TSDB.\n1.24.1 Minimum Identifying Criteria. Each nomination must contain minimum\nidentifying criteria for inclusion into the TSDB. Without this minimum identifying data,\nthe nomination is not eligible for inclusion into the TSDB, or any of the TSC's\nsupported systems. Chapter 2 sets forth guidance regarding both the minimum\nidentifying biometric and biographic criteria for inclusion into the TSDB. Although\nTIDE accepts records containing less than these minimum criteria, such records will not\nbe exported either to the TSDB for watchlisting or to the various supported systems used\nby the SCREENERS absent an exception described in the Watchlisting Guidance.\n1.24.2 Minimum Substantive Derogatory Criteria. In addition to the minimum\nidentifying criteria, nominations to the TSDB are accepted based on a REASONABLE\nSUSPICION that the individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST derived from the\n\n\nSee Appendix 4, Addendum B to the TSC MOU.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 12\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\ntotality of the information reviewed for nomination.18 To demonstrate that the\nnomination has sufficient indicia of reliability to support this R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION\ndetermination, NOMINATING AGENCIES should implement processes designed to ensure\nthat nominations are free from errors, that recalled or revised information is reviewed\nregularly, and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those\nrevisions/retractions are made. N O M I N A T I N G AGENCIES should, to the extent possible\ngiven the nature of the reporting, verify the accuracy and reliability of the information\nincluded in nominations, in some cases, the NOMINATING A G E N C Y may not be able to\nevaluate the reliability of the information received; however, in such situations, the\nN O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y can ensure that the information provided is an accurate\nrepresentation of the information obtained. Chapter 3 sets forth further guidance\nregarding the application of the R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION standard to TSDB nominations.\nVI.\n\nWATCHLISTING PROCESS OVERVIEW\n1.25 The authorities referenced in Section II of this Chapter created the framework for the\nwatchlisting enterprise by combining various functions of existing government entities and\njoining them to new organizations with counterterrorism responsibilities. The resulting\nwatchlisting enterprise consists of ORIGINATORS, N O M I N A T O R S , A G G R E G A T O R S , SCREENERS\nand encountering agencies that are supported by the community-wide collection, nomination,\nand consolidation processes.\n1.26\n\nAll Executive Departments\nand Agencies have responsibility for collecting, collating, and sharing TERRORISM\nINFORMATION to support the watchlisting process. They are called ORIGINATORS because they\ninitially collect and identify information supporting the conclusion that an individual is a\nK N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORIST. An ORIGINATOR is the Department or Agency that has\nappropriate subject matter interest and classification authority and collects TERRORISM\nINFORMATION {i.e., raw information) and disseminates it or TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to other\nU.S. Government entities via an intelligence report (i.e., finished intelligence) or other\nmechanism. In general, when an ORIGINATOR has identified international TERRORISM\nINFORMATION and determines that information should be provided to NCTC, the ORIGINATOR\ntakes on the N O M I N A T O R role. A N O M I N A T O R is a Federal Department or Agency that has\ninformation to indicate that an individual meets the criteria for a K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D\nTERRORIST and nominates that individual to TIDE and the TSDB based on information that\noriginated with that Agency.\nORIGINATORS, NOMINATORS, AGGREGATORS, a n d SCREENERS.\n\n1.27 While all N O M I N A T O R S have the duty of upholding informational standards, the NCTC and\nTSC are distinctly responsible for ensuring data quality and the integrity of their respective\nrepositories. NCTC and TSC are themselves potential N O M I N A T O R S . Analysts from the\n\n\nP l e a s e n o t e that t h e r e are a l s o certain e x c e p t i o n s to the m i n i m u m b i o g r a p h i c i n f o r m a t i o n a n d m i n i m u m s u b s t a n t i v e\nd e r o g a t o r y criteria r e q u i r e d f o r T e r r o r i s t W a t c h l i s t n o m i n a t i o n s that s u p p o r t i m m i g r a t i o n a n d v i s a s c r e e n i n g activities\nc o n d u c t e d by D H S a n d D O S . See C h a p t e r 2, Section 111 a n d C h a p t e r 3, Section V .\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage| 13\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nNCTC may discover an individual who is eligible for watchlisting while reviewing all-source\ninformation. In these cases, NCTC analysts will request that the ORIGINATOR submit a\nnomination for inclusion into TIDE; or, on a limited basis or during exigent circumstances,\nNCTC analysts may update TIDE directly with a disseminated report and noticc to the\nORIGINATOR(S). In instances where disseminated reporting is used to enhance TIDE, NCTC\nwill provide notice back to the collecting agency via TIDE. TSC may also nominate\nTERRORISM INFORMATION received pursuant to TERRORISM screening conducted by foreign\ngovernments.\n1.28 NCTC and I SC are responsible for reviewing both newly nominated individuals, as well as\nsubsets of existing records, to determine if additional and/or enhancement (research) is\nrequired to locate missing information critical to the watchlisting process. In some cases, this\nwill require research to locate additional DEROGATORY INFORMATION to meet the minimum\nsubstantive derogatory criteria for watchlisting. In other cases, this will require research to\nlocate additional biographic or biometric identifiers, in order to provide a comprehensive\nrecord maximizing the probability of confirming a POSITIVE MATCH to an identity contained in\nthe TSDB.\n1.29\n\nare those who receive and hold TERRORISM INFORMA H O N and certain other\nthey are authorized to receive and retain. For example, two of\nNCTC's main statutory missions are to serve as the (1) central and shared knowledge bank on\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and (2) primary organization in the U.S. Government for\nanalyzing and integrating all intelligence information possessed or acquired by the U.S.\nGovernment pertaining to TERRORISM and counterterrorism.19\nAGGREGATORS\n\nnon-TERRORLSM INFORMATION\n\n1.30 TSC takes on the role of an AGGREGATOR when a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is\nencountered and the individual's record is enhanced or updated with ENCOUNTER-related\ninformation. As noted in Paragraphs 1.1 and 1.7, the TSC manages the watchlisting process\nand plays a key role in helping Departments and Agencies determine whether an ENCOUNTER\nwith a member of the public is one with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Additional\nTERRORISM INFORMATION or TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are generated during ENCOUNTERS and the\nEncounter Management Application (EMA) 20 uses that information to update records of\nKNOWN o r SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.\n\n1.31\n\nvet against the TSDB to determine if an individual is a possible match to a KNOWN\nor SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the TSDB. SCREENERS can include federal, state, local, tribal,\nterritorial, or foreign governments and certain private entities. Screening officials include\nhomeland security officers, consular affairs officers, transportation safety personnel, and\nofficials of foreign governments with whom the United States has entered into a TERRORISM\nSCREENING INFORMATION sharing agreement pursuant to HSPD-6. Certain Departments and\nAgencies have components which perform both screening and law enforcement duties. If a\nSCREENERS\n\n\" S e e 50 U.S.C. §404o.\nE M A is an application used by t h e T S C to administer ENCOUNTER i n f o r m a t i o n .\n\n30\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage| 14\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nS C R E E N E R believes an individual may be on the Watchlist, the screener contacts the TSC's\nTerrorist Screening Operations Center (TSOC). The TSOC will determine whether the\nindividual the S C R E E N E R has encountered is, in fact, a POSITIVE M A T C H to the individual who\nis on the Terrorist Watchlist. The TSOC may also notify the FBI's Counterterrorism Division\n(CTD) that there has been a positive E N C O U N T E R with a watchlistcd subject. TSC's Terrorist\nScreening Operations Unit (TSOU) coordinates the appropriate operational response to the\nE N C O U N T E R . Based on the TERRORISM I N F O R M A T I O N made available by the O R I G I N A T I N G\nA G E N C Y , the S C R E E N E R will take action based upon its specific authorities (e.g., requiring\nadditional screening at an airport checkpoint, denying a visa application, determining\nadmissibility into the United States) and follow appropriate E N C O U N T E R procedures, as set\nforth in Chapter 5.\n\n1.32 Collection, Nomination, Consolidation and the Use of the Terrorist Watchlist to Perform\nScreening Processes. The following is a chart depicting the collection, T E R R O R I S T\nnomination, consolidation and screening processes:\nImmigration\nScreening\nU.S. IminigijfQnand\nCustoms Entarcementand\nU.S Citienshipand\nImmigrait*» Servie«\n\nState/Local/Trlbal\nNational Crime\nInformation Center\n\nBorders\n\nTerrorist\nScreening\nDatabase\n(TSDB)\n\nU.S. Custornsand Border\nProtection\n\nJo Fly/Selectee/TSDB\nTransportation Security\nAdministration\n\nPassport/VISA\nDepartmentof State\nConsularLookoutfc\nSupport System\n\nFBI\nSentinel\n\nForeign\nPartners\n\nDepartment of\nDefense\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 15\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.33 The arrows fade inside the TSDB cylinder because not every nomination from NCTC (for\ninternational TERRORISM) or the FBI (for domestic TERRORISM) is exported from the TSDB to\nSCREENERS (represented by the multi-colored blocks at the far right of the chart).\nFor\nexample, certain categories of individuals that do not meet the minimum identifying criteria\n(,see Chapter 2, Section II) or the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard (see Chapter 3, Section II)\ncan be watchlisted to support immigration and visa screening activities by DHS and DOS (see\nChapter 3, Section V) but are not exported to state/local/tribal SCREENERS or foreign partners.\nSimilarly, when ORIGINATORS provide FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION to NCTC for inclusion in\nTIDE, such information will not be exported from TIDE to the TSDB, unless the NOMINATING\nAGENCY believes there is REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that the individual is a KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST. FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION is provided to NCTC where it can be\nfurther analyzed, connected to existing information, and added to TIDE for export to TSDB\nbecause NCTC, and not individual ORIGINATORS, has access to all the information available to\nthe U.S. Government on a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.\nVII.\n\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES FOR THE WATCHLISTING AND SCREENING\nCOMMUNITY\n1.34 Delineation of roles and responsibilities of NOMINATING AGENCIES, SCREENERS, NC TC, and\nthe TSC is critical to provide for an effective and efficient integrated Terrorist Watchlist\nenterprise. While IISPD-6 describes the broad mandate of developing an integrated watchlist\nsystem, and the TSC MOU provides a level of detail needed to fulfill that mandate, further\nclarification is required to ensure there are neither gaps in the nomination process, nor\nwasteful redundancies.\n1.35 Pursuant to USPD-6, Departments and Agencies in the Executive Branch are required, to the\nextent permitted by law, to provide TERRORIST INFORMATION to NCTC. This process will be\naccomplished either through direct nomination to NCTC, or through a specific component\ndesignated by a Federal Department or Agency head for doing so (e.g., all DOJ components\nare directed to nominate through the FBI; DHS Intelligence and Analysis (l&A) has oversight\nresponsibility for all DHS nominations). Except as detailed in the sections applicable to\nexpedited nominations (see Paragraphs 1.58 and 1.59), NOMINATING AGENCIES will endeavor\nto provide comprehensive nominations and include the maximum amount of identifying and\nDEROGATORY INFORMATION. 2 2 NOMINATING DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES should prioritize\n?l\n\nThe Terrorist Screening Database Annex D to the FBI Memorandum of Understanding with Department of Defense\n(DoD), signed February 22, 2012, established DoD as a screening agency customer of the TSC. The dashed line in the\nlatter chart represents that DoD is finalizing procedures to receive and use information from the TSDB for its screening\nprocesses.\nIn May 2010, the Deputies asked that NOMINATING AGENCIES \"ensure that nominations are comprehensive and\ninclude the maximum amount of identifying and DEROGATORY INFORMATION.\" In 2012, the Interagency Policy\nCommittee (IPC), in coordination with NOMINATORS, SCREENERS, NCTC and TSC, developed a prioritized list of data\nidentifiers that arc critical to screening and identity resolution activities. This Identity Resolution and Enhancement\nTiers document is available on N C T C ' s Watchlisting Community of Interest portal on the Joint Worldwide Intelligence\nCommunications System (JWICS).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 16\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nthe identification of new K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORISTS who meet the R E A S O N A B L E\nSUSPICION standard, along with the identifying and DEROGATORY INFORMATION most useful to\nwatchlisting, and screening effort, as well as assisting in identity resolution.\n1.36 Each Department or Agency that nominates a K N O W N or SUSPECTED TERRORIST to NCTC for\nwatchlisting is under a continuing obligation to provide NCTC with newly identified\nD E R O G A T O R Y INFORMATION or exculpatory information obtained by that Department or\nAgency. Each Department or Agency also has the responsibility to provide NCTC with newly\nidentified identifying and DEROGATORY INFORMATION obtained from their Department or\nAgency, regardless if they were the original N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y .\n1.37 With the noted exception of the Visa Viper Program, Departments and Agencies should not\nnominate K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORISTS to NCTC based on information that they do not\noriginate without first coordinating with the ORIGINATOR.\nVIII.\n\nQUALITY CONTROL MEASURES\n1.38 In order to produce and maintain the most reliable and accurate information in TIDE, TSDB,\nand screening databases, quality control is considered a responsibility of all entities.\nN O M I N A T I N G D E P A R T M E N T S A N D AGENCIES must establish and maintain processes, including\nappropriate training and guidance, to ensure information transmitted to NCTC is consistent\nwith the source of the information.\n1.39 HSPD-6 Requirements. 1ISPD-6 requires the TSC to maintain thorough, accurate, and\ncurrent information concerning K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORISTS. For watchlisting purposes,\n\"current\" means information that the N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y reasonably believes is valid and\naccurate. The requirement that information be current does not necessarily preclude\ninformation that is several years old from being included in the TSDB if there is no reason to\nbelieve the information may have changed (e.g., information regarding an individual's date of\nbirth or TERRORIST ACTIVITY was collected 20 years ago but has not been superseded by\nadditional information is still relevant). N O M I N A T O R S should consider the date of the\nD E R O G A T O R Y INFORMATION in the context of analyzing the overall quality of the data, as well\nas the severity of the threat, to determine whether the individual warrants watchlisting. The\ndate of the D E R O G A T O R Y INFORMATION may refer to both the date the information is collected\n(such as a report that was collected 50 years ago) as well as the date of the information that is\nreferenced in the reporting (such as a recent report that references an event that occurred 50\nyears ago).\n1.40 TSC MOV Obligations. Paragraph 15 of the TSC MOU provides that the TSC \"will\ndetermine, according to criteria established jointly with the entity responsible for each\nsupported system, which supported screening processes will query that entry in the\nconsolidated TERRORIST screening database.\" Pursuant to that paragraph, the TSC is required\nto \"make these determinations based on criteria and procedures developed in coordination\nwith the Parties to this Memorandum and in consultation with the heads of appropriate Federal\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 17\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nDepartments and Agencies based on factors, including but not limited to, the following:\n1.40.1\n\nt h e n a t u r e o f t h e p e r s o n ' s a s s o c i a t i o n w i t h TERRORISM;\n\n1.40.2\nthe quality of the data, including credibility, reliability, and extent of\ncorroboration; and,\n•\n\n1.40.3\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n9*1\n\nthe extent of uniquely identifying data.. . . \"\n\n1.41 Provide Guidance and Training. Each Agency will provide guidance on the watchlisting\nbusiness process. Analysts will receive periodic refresher training, as needed.\n1.42\n\nN O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y Procedures. Each N O M I N A T O R providing international T E R R O R I S T\nwatchlisting nominations to NCTC is responsible for the accuracy of its information and has a\ncontinuing responsibility to notify NCTC of any changes that affect the validity or reliability\nof such information. 24 NCTC analysts will review each nomination for T E R R O R I S T\nwatchlisting prior to its inclusion into TIDE and its export to the TSDB.\n\n1.43 Each N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y should implement processes designed to ensure that nominations\nare free from errors, that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly, and that\nnecessary corrections to nominations based on those revisions/retractions are made.\nN O M I N A T I N G A G E N C I E S should, to the extent possible given the nature of the reporting, verify\nthe accuracy and reliability of the information included in nominations. The following\nrepresents the type of processes that each N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y shall develop that arc tailored\nto each Agency's particular mission and operational environment:\n1.43.1\nDevelop Adequate Factual Predicate. Each N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y will seek to\nobtain as much D E R O G A T O R Y I N F O R M A T I O N and identifying information as practicable\nconcerning the K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D T E R R O R I S T who is being nominated.\n1.43.2 Provide Guidance and Training. Each N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y will provide guidance\non the T E R R O R I S T watchlisting nomination process and ensure that analysts involved in\nthe nomination process arc trained on a periodic basis.\n1.43.3 Require Quality Assurance Review. Each N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y will use a quality\nassurance process to review nominations for accuracy prior to forwarding the\ninformation to NCTC.\n1.43.4\n\nHeightened Review for\n\nU.S. PERSONS.\n\nThe nominations of\n\nU.S. PERSONS\n\nrequire\n\n\nSee A p p e n d i x 3 , TSC\nMOU.\nPURELY DOMESTIC TERRORISM INFORMATION is p r o v i d e d d i r c c t l y t o T S C b y t h e F B I a n d is s u b j e c t t o t h e s a m e\nc o n d i t i o n s a p p l i c a b l e t o t h e n o m i n a t i o n p r o c e d u r e s f o r t h o s e a s s o c i a t e d with i n t e r n a t i o n a l TERRORISM.\n34\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 18\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nspecial considerations and procedures.2^ See Paragraph 3.15.\n1.43.5\n\nU.S. PERSON\n\nDeterminations.\n\nNOMINATORS m u s t take r e a s o n a b l e s t e p s t o d e t e r m i n e\n\nw h e t h e r an i n d i v i d u a l is a U.S. PERSON.\n\n1.43.6 U.S. PERSON Review and Confirmation. Nominations of U.S. PERSONS to the\nTerrorist Watchlist shall be reviewed by the NOMINATING AGENCY'S legal counsel or a\ndesignated reviewer to confirm that the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard has been met\nor that the nomination meets an exception to the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard, and\nto ensure that the nomination conforms to Agency specific U.S. PERSON authorities and\nguidelines.\n1.43.7 Reliability and Accuracy Limitations. Nominations will includc any limitations on\nthe reliability or accuracy of the information.\n1.43.8 Periodic Reviews. The NOMINATING AGENCY will conduct periodic reviews of their\nnominations of U.S. PERSONS to the Terrorist Watchlist, at minimum on an annual basis,\nwhen there is no corresponding FBI investigation to ensure that the U.S. PERSON\ncontinues to meet watchlisting criteria.\n1.43.9 Redress Procedures. As per the establishment of a formal watchlist redress process\n(see Chapter 1, Section XI), entities involved in the watchlisting proccss shall establish\ninternal reviews and redress procedures.\n1.44 Each NOMINATING AGENCY will have procedures that facilitate the prevention, identification,\nand correction of any errors in information that is shared as part of the watchlisting process.\nProcedures will include the review of retractions and/or corrections of information that may\nhave been used to support a nomination. In cases where a retraction or other information has\nbecome available, the NOMINATING AGENCY will promptly send a watchlist removal request or\nmodification, as appropriate, to NCTC. Each NOMINATING AGENCY must provide notice of\nany errors or outdated information to NCTC immediately unless there is an articulated reason\nwhy such notification could not be made immediately. NCTC will process and transmit to\nTSC such corrections upon receipt.\n1.45 NCTC Review. In addition to review by NCTC analysts, NCTC will employ a quality\ncontrol proccss to ensure that all standards and appropriate procedures have been employed,\nthe data is accurate, and the presentation of the material is clear, concise, and complies with\nestablished definitions and conventions. NCTC must also have processes and procedures in\nplace to ensure the information documented in TIDE and provided to the TSC is accurately\ntranscribed. NCTC shall ensure there is a process in place for review and/or auditing of TIDE\nrecords.\n\n\nSee Executive Order 12333, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552a(cX7).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage| 19\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.46 TSC Review. TSC personnel will review the nominations received as described in Paragraph\n1.56. TSC personnel evaluate whether nominations meet watchlisting standards and weigh, as\nappropriate, all-source analysis before accepting or rejecting a nomination. The TSC has a\ncritical role to play in quality control, as the I SC review is the last step before any record\n(including a biometric nomination where no name is available) is sent to various screening\nsystems. As with NCTC, the TSC should ensure there is a process in placc for review and/or\nauditing of TSC nominations and TSC records.\nIX.\n\nNOMINATION PROCEDURES\n1.47\n\n1.48\n\nDistinctions between U.S. P E R S O N S under Executive Order 12333 and Aliens under the\nImmigration and Nationality Act. This Watchlisting Guidance generally adopts the\ndefinition of U.S. PERSON from Executive Order 1 2 3 3 3 (as amended) for nomination\nprocedures. Executive Order 1 2 3 3 3 defines a U . S . PERSON as \"A United States citizen, an alien\nknown by the intelligence element concerned to be a permanent resident alien, an\nunincorporated association substantially composed of United States citizens or permanent\nresident aliens, or a corporation incorporated in the United States, except for a corporation\ndirected or controlled by a foreign government or governments.\" The Watchlisting Guidance\nalso contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for\nTERRORIST watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by the DHS and\nDOS to determine whether ineligibilities exist for admission to the United States or visa\nadjudication pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Because the INA\ndefines \"aliens\" as any person not a citizen or national of the United States, the INA\nadmissibility provisions also apply to Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), in certain\ncircumstances, who are considered U . S . PERSONS under Executive Order 1 2 3 3 3 .\nConsequently, NCTC developed a mechanism in TIDE to identify and distinguish U.S.\ncitizens from non-U.S. citizens in order to further distinguish between \"aliens\" under the INA\nand U . S . PERSONS under Executive Order 1 2 3 3 3 . 2 6\nNominations Procedures. As mentioned in Paragraph 1.26, when an\nbecomes a NOMINATOR, it prepares a nomination document and forwards it to\nNCTC through the NOMINATOR tool.\nORIGINATOR'S\n\nORIGINATOR\n\n1.48.1 As a general rule, NCTC will attach all disseminated communications (cablcs or\nforms) to the TERRORIST identities rccord as a \"source\" document, which will b e\navailable on NCTC Current or the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications\nSystem (JWICS) to individuals who have been granted access to TIDE.\n1.48.2 Because NCTC is the conduit for passing international TERRORISM INFORMATION to\nTSC for TERRORISM screening purposes, there is no longer a need to send watchlist\nrequests to multiple Government Agencies. By sending a Terrorist Watchlist\nnomination cable to NCTC, all potential U.S. Government TERRORISM screening\n\nSee I N A § 101(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)],\n\nUNCLASS1FIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 20\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nresponsibilities should be accounted for.\n1.48.3\nThe DOJ has approved a Protocol to govern TERRORIST nominations for its non-FBI\ncomponents, which requires components to provide the FBI with all TERRORISM\nI N F O R M A T I O N . 2 7 The FBI is responsible for submitting watchlisting nominations based\non information received from other DOJ components pursuant to the FBI's nomination\nprocedures.\n1.48.4 DHS has designated the Under Secretary for I&A as the Executive Agent for DHS'\ncentralized TERRORIST watchlisting process and he/she shall be responsible for providing\na DHS wide-mechanism for nominating all identifying or D E R O G A T O R Y INFORMATION\nabout K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORISTS to TIDE. DHS I&A is also responsible for\nproviding training/certification programs to the components.\n1.49 In providing information to NCTC for inclusion into TIDE, the ORIGINATOR i s responsible for\ndetermining whether it may, by law, provide the information to NCTC, in accordancc with\nsection 1021(d)(6) of IRTPA. This information shall be provided with any applicable caveats\nor dissemination controls, which will be reflected in TIDE. The biographic and biometric\nidentifiers derived from this information will be deemed U//FOUO for passage to TSDB\nunless the ORIGINATOR designates them as \"TIDE Restricted,\" as outlined in Addendum B to\nthe TSC MOU.\n1.50 NCTC Actions and Processes. NCTC reviews TERRORIST nominations from Federal\nDepartments or Agencies ( N O M I N A T O R S ) as described in Paragraph 1.28.\n1.51\n\nIn determining whether an individual is a K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORIST, NCTC will rely\non the designation of \" K N O W N TERRORIST\" provided by the N O M I N A T O R as presumptively\nvalid. This presumption can be overcome if NCTC has specific and credible information\nwithin its possession that such designation is not appropriate, at which point NCTC will\nprovide such information to the N O M I N A T O R .\n\n1.52 In reviewing whether to include the TERRORISM INFORMATION about the K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D\nTERRORIST in TIDE, NCTC reviews the totality of information. The totality of information is\nevaluated based on the experience of the reviewer, and the facts and rational inferences that\nmay be drawn from those facts, including past conduct, current actions, and credible\nintelligence conccrning future conduct. As part of this review, NCTC will determine if the\ninformation pertains to, or is related to, TERRORISM. TIDE includes TERRORISM INFORMATION\non K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORISTS and may include additional TERRORISM INFORMA TION\nbeyond what meets the minimum substantive derogatory and identifying criteria required for\nnominations to the TSDB, as described in Paragraph 1.24. Upon conclusion of NCTC's\nreview, NCTC will either accept or reject the nomination:\n\n\nSee A p p e n d i x 7 , D O J P r o t o c o l o n T e r r o r i s t N o m i n a t i o n s .\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 21\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.52.1 Accept Nomination. If a nomination contains TERRORISM INFORMATION, NCTC\nwill create or enhance the associated TIDE record with the data contained in the\nnomination. If the minimum substantive derogatory and identifying criteria are met,\nNCTC will forward the TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to the TSC for placement in TSDB with\nthe NOMINATOR'S watchlist recommendation.\n1.52.2 Reject Nomination. If a nomination does not contain TERRORISM INFORMATION,\nNCTC may reject the nomination. NCTC will review rejected nominations and search\nholdings for additional data that may support a TERRORISM INFORMATION finding. If no\ninformation is found to support the nomination, NCTC will notify the NOMINATING\nAGENCY of the rejection.\n1.53 Types of records in TIDE. There are two types of records in TIDE:\n1.53.1\n\nRecords. The vast majority of records in TIDE are for KNOWN or\ninternational TERRORISTS. These records arc labeled \"TERRORISTS.\" Only a\nsmall percentage of TERRORIST records in TIDE concern U.S. PERSONS.\nTERRORIST\n\nSUSPECTED\n\n1.53.2 N o n - T E R R O R I S T Records. A small percentage of records in TIDE are identified and\nlabeled \"Non-TERRORISTS.\" 2 8 These records are generally of familial family members\nor associates of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and assist DOS and DHS in, for\nexample, adjudicating visas and immigration processing, or assist the IC in tracking\nKNOWN TERRORISTS. These \"Non-TERRORISTS\" include:\n1.53.2.1\nAlien Spouses and Children of TERRORISTS. Based on section\n212(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX) of the INA, alien spouses and children of TERRORISTS may be\ninadmissible to the United States. 29 TIDE exports records pertaining to alien\nspouses and children of alien international TERRORISTS (also known as TIDE\nCategory Code 17) to support immigration and visa screening activities by DOS\nand DHS;\n1.53.2.2 Other Relatives. TIDE also includes \"non- TERRORIST\" records of\nindividuals who have a close relationship to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED international\n\nTIDE records for non-U.S. citizens, including LPRs, with insufficient DEROGATORY INFORMATION to meet the\nREASONABLE SUSPICION standard (TIDE Category Code 99) and records relating to an individual who has a defined\nrelationship with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, but whose involvement with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST'S activities is unknown (TIDE Category Code 50) are exported to the TSDB as TSDB exceptions to the\nREASONABLE SUSPICION standard. Additionally, individuals described by sources as \"TERRORISTS\", \"extremists\",\n\"jihadists\", \"militants\", \"mujahideen\" or \"insurgents\" (TIDE Category Code 03, also referred to as a \"labels plus\"\nnomination) will be accepted into the TSDB as exceptions for export to DHS and DOS for immigration and border\nprocessing. See Paragraph 3.14.6. A complete list of TIDE Category Codes can found under the \"Watchlisting Criteria\nGuidance\" section on the Intelink website at http://www.intelink.gov/tsc/leizal.htm.\n2>\n\"Any alien w h o . . . . is the spouse or child of an alien who is inadmissible under this subparagraph, if the activity\ncausing the alien to be found inadmissible occurred within the last 5 years, is inadmissible.\" See INA §\n212(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX)|8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(lX)].\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 22\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nbut are not alien spouses or children of a TERRORIST. For instance, the\nfather or brother of a TERRORIST could have a record in TIDE (also known as TIDE\nCategory Code 160). Thus, these \"other relatives\" could be U.S. PERSONS or nonU.S. PERSONS. Identifiers for these other relations reside in TIDE but are not\nexported to the TSC for watchlisting, absent independent DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION. Instead, these records may be retained in TIDE for analytic\npurposes;\n\nTERRORIST\n\n1.53.2.3\n\nPassports. Unrecovered lost or stolen passports in the hands of international\n(also known as TIDE Category Code 89);\n\nTERRORISTS\n\n1.53.2.4\n\nAssociates. Individuals who have a defined relationship with the KNOWN or\nbut whose involvement with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST'S activities is unknown (also known as TIDE Category Code 50);\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST,\n\n1.53.2.5\nIndividuals with a Possible Nexus to T E R R O R I S M . Individuals with a\npossible nexus to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY but for whom additional\nDEROGATORY INFORMA TION is needed to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard\n(also known as TIDE Category Code 99).\n1.54 Identification of U . S . P E R S O N Status in TIDE. NCTC analysts will review the totality of\ninformation available on a subject to discern U . S . PERSON status prior to creating or\nenhancing a record in TIDE, whenever possible. For existing TIDE records, this status is\navailable to the analyst in the first field of the TIDE record. In case of external\nnominations or E N H A N C E M E N T S from the IC, the standard nomination template provides a\nmeans for N O M I N A T O R S to identify U.S. PERSON status pursuant to Executive Order 12333\nand the Agency's specific guidelines. The U.S. PERSON status field on the standard\nnomination template is a required field and it is the responsibility of each N O M I N A T I N G\nA G E N C Y to ensure the field is properly annotated in accordance with established policy.\n1.55 Types of Records in TIDE and the TSDB. Not all records in TIDE are included in the\nTSDB. For example, records with FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION that do not meet the\nminimum derogatory standard or records that do not meet identifying information criteria\nremain in TIDE and are not included in the TSDB, absent direction for temporary, threat\nbased categories pursuant to Paragraph 1.59. 30 The nominations process for TIDE records\nthat will be considered for entry in the TSDB begins with an automated data transfer process\nthat moves an individual TIDE record containing the identity of a KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST or other exportable category or record nominated for watchlisting to the TSDB.\n1.56 TSC Actions and Processes. The TSC's Single Review Queue (SR.Q) enables the TSC's\nNominations and Data Integrity Unit (NDIU) to review each KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST\n\n30\n\nCertain c a t e g o r i e s o f non-TERRORJST r e c o r d s (see Paragraph 1.53.2) o r n o m i n a t i o n s to the N o Fly a n d S e l e c t e e List\nbased on an e x p e d i t e d w a i v e r o f \" f u l l date o f birth\" r e q u i r e m e n t (see Paragraph 4 . 1 8 ) m a y also be eligible f o r inclusion\nin the T S D B .\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 23\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n^1\n\nrecord nomination to ensure it meets the watchlisting standard. The SRQ also helps ensure\nthat all qualified records are made available to the appropriate SCRF.ENERS for use in\nTERRORISM screening. During the SRO process, every request to add, modify, or delete a\nTSDB record is reviewed by a TSC analyst to ensure the accuracy of watchlisting records and\nthe removal of inaccurate records from TSDB.\n1.56.1 Within the TSC's NDIU, experienced analysts and/or designated Agency\nrepresentatives serve as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with respect to specific\ndatabases (e.g., No Fly or Selectee List) that receive TSDB data for TERRORISM\nscreening purposes. The NDIU currently has four types of SMEs who specialize in the\ninformation/systems from their respective organizations: DHS/Transportation Security\nAdministration (TSA) for the No Fly, Selectee and Expanded Selectee Lists, FBI for\nNational Crime Information Center ( N C I C ) / K N O W N or SUSPECTED TERRORIST File\n(KSTF), DOS for the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD)32 and DHS for TECS (and\nits components) and the Automated Targeting System (ATS). SMEs provide guidance\nregarding their specific information/systems to the TSC and watchlisting standards to\ntheir Agencies. In some cases, the SME coordinates the data export to the supported\nsystem, provides feedback to N O M I N A T O R S , and responds to inquiries regarding their\nsupported system from other TSC customer Agencies.\n1.56.2 Upon the conclusion of TSC's review, TSC will either accept or reject the\nnomination:\n1.56.2.1 Acccpt Nomination. Consistent with Paragraphs (7) and (8) of Addendum B\nto the TSC MOV, if a nomination contains the minimum substantive derogatory\ncriteria and the minimum identifying information, I SC will create a TSDB record,\ninclude the TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS from the TIDE record, and export the TSDB\nrecord to its supported systems (i.e., databases and systems eligible to receive\nrecords from the TSDB) for the benefit of SCREENERS that conduct TERRORISM\nscreening. The current supported systems include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n1.56.2.1.1\n\nNCIC/KSTF;\n\n1.56.2.1.2\n\nDOS Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS)-VISA and\n\nCCD;\n\n32\n\n1.56.2.1.3\n\nDIIS Watchlisting Service (WLS) (e.g., TECS, ATS, Secure Flight);\n\n1.56.2.1.4\n\nTSA Transportation Security Vetting Center;\n\n1.56.2.1.5\n\nTSA-Otfice of Intelligence Analysis (01 A);\n\n1.56.2.1.6\n\nTipoff United States Canada (TUSCAN);\n\nSee C h a p t e r 1, S c c t i o n VIII, supra.\nC C D is an a p p l i c a t i o n u s e d by D O S to a d m i n i s t e r its visa a n d p a s s p o r t a p p l i c a t i o n s .\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 24\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n1.56.2.1.7 Tipoff Australia Counterterrorism Information Control System\n(TACTICS).\n1.56.2.2\nReject Nomination. If a nomination lacks either the minimum substantive\nderogatory criteria or the minimum identifying information, and is not an\nexception to those requirements (e.g., TIDE Category Codes 50 or 99 as described\nin Paragraph 1.53.2), TSC will reject the nomination and notify NCTC directly of\nits determination or coordinate with NCTC to notify the NOMINATOR of its\ndetermination. Records nominated to TIDE that are ineligible for TERRORIST\nwatchlisting may remain in TIDE until additional information is obtained to\nwarrant either watchlisting or removal from TIDE. NCTC analysts will review allsource information for additional identifying or substantive DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION. If additional information is discovered, NCTC will enhance the\nTIDE record and submit the record to TSC for inclusion in the TSDB. The TIDE\nrecord will be reviewed again by the TSC to determine whether it is eligible for\nwatchlisting in TSDB and export to certain supported screening systems.33\n1.57 The number of TSC's supported systems will continue to grow as TSC, DHS, and DOS\nexpand their domestic and international outreach efforts and finalize additional agreements to\nexchange TERRORISM SCREENING INFORMATION. TSC has modified the TSDB so that certain\ncustomers may query the TSDB remotely instead of receiving exports of TSDB data to their\nown systems.\n1.58 Expedited Nomination Procedures for Individual Nominations. If exigent\ncircumstances exist (imminent travel and/or threat) where an individual nomination into the\nTSDB needs to be expedited after normal duty hours, a NOMINATOR, with coordination from\nNCTC, may contact the TSC's TSOC directly. If a NOMINATOR coordinated with NCTC, the\nnomination will be received by the TSC via the SRQ in TSDB and the TSOC Watch\nCommander will coordinate with a NDIU Senior Analyst to process the nomination. A\nN O M I N A T O R may also contact the TSC directly and provide all relevant information using the\nfollowing process:\n1.58.1\n\nThe\n571\n\nN O M I N A TOR\n\nmust first contact the TSOC at\n\n(toll free number) or\n\nThe N O M I N A T O R will be instructed by a TSOC Specialist on how to telephonically\ncomplete a Terrorist Screening Center Expedited Nomination Request Form.\n\n1.58.2\n\n1.58.3 In addition to basic identifying information, the NOMINATOR will be requested to\nprovide a 24/7 point of contact should the K N O W N or SUSPECTED TERRORIST be\nencountered by a SCREENER.\n\n33\n\nSee P a r a g r a p h 1.24.2\n\nsupra.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 25\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.58.4 Within 72 hours of contacting the TSOC, the NOMINATOR must provide appropriate\nfollow-up documentation that articulates, through either classified or unclassified means,\nthe substantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION used to establish the basis for TERRORIST\nwatchlisting.\n1.59 Expedited Nomination Procedures for Temporary, Threat-Based Categories. This\nprovision is intended to enable categories of individuals to be temporarily upgraded in\nwatchlist status based on current and credible intelligence information or a particular threat\nstream that indicates a certain category of individuals may be used to conduct an act of\ndomestic or international TERRORISM. This temporary, threat-based expedited upgrade (TBU)\nis made at the direction of the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and\nCounterterrorism or his/her designee (Appropriate Official) and should be narrowly tailored to\naddress the threat.\n1.59.1\nThe goal of this provision is to fashion a watchlisting response that is appropriate to\nthe nature, specificity, and severity of the threat. To achieve this goal, in addition to\nverifying the credibility of the threat intelligence, due consideration should be given to:\n1.59.1.1\n\nThe harm to public safety posed by the threat;\n\n1.59.1.2 The clarity and specificity of the information giving rise to the threat as to\ntime, place, method, and identity of the suspected perpetrators;\n1.59.1.3 The anticipated impact on international and domestic travel, civil liberties,\nand foreign relations; and,\n1.59.1.4 The best available screening tools, other than the No Fly or Selectee Lists,\ngiven the type and specificity of identifiers and travel data.\n\n1.59.2 When necessitated by exigent circumstances, and where there is current and credible\nintelligence information or a particular threat stream that indicates a certain category of\nindividuals may be used to conduct an act of domestic or international TERRORISM, the\nAppropriate Official may direct the TSC and NCTC to place categories of individuals\nfrom TIDE or TSDB on the No Fly List, Selectee List, or into the TSDB for up to 72\nhours before concurrence is obtained from the Deputies or Principals Committee. To the\nextent practicable, the initial direction to NCTC and TSC from the Appropriate Official\nwill be in writing. Absent DEROGATORY INFORMATION supporting individual nomination\nor watchlist upgrade, if written concurrence is not obtained within 72 hours of the initial\ndirection to TSC and NCTC, the TSC will automatically remove any individuals added\nto the No Fly List, Selectec List, or TSDB pursuant to the TBU, until such written\ndirection is received.\n1.59.3 The addition of categories of individuals to the No Fly List, Selectee List, or TSDB\npursuant to Paragraph 1.59.2 shall be effected for a period of time, consistent with the\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 26\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nnature of the threat involved, not to exceed 30 days but may be renewed for additional\n30-day periods upon written approval of the Deputies or Principals Committee. A TBU\nis valid until the threat no longer exists. To the extent that such threat recedes or is\notherwise mitigated prior to the expiration of 30 days or during any extension approved\nby the Deputies or Principals Committee, TSC and NCTC and members of the\nwatchlisting community shall immediately request of the Deputies or Principals\nCommittee to downgrade these TBUs to their original or appropriate status. All threatbased records transmitted through automated mechanisms (i.e., WLS, CCD) will include\na \"TBU indicator\" at the message level to differentiate this category of records from\nnon-TBU records and to provide the TBU directive for which the record is upgraded.\n1.59.4 Until such time as the Deputies or Principals provide additional, written guidance,\nDOS will defer visa actions with respect to these expedited upgrades in watchlist status.\n1.59.5 Departments and Agencies will advise the Deputies or Principals of other\nconsequences that may result from a change in watchlist status and seek guidance as to\nhow to proceed.\n1.59.6 After these categorical moves arc accomplished or renewed, there will be an\nexpedited procedure for the review of all U. S. PERSONS that are part of the TBU to ensure\ntheir watchlisting status is appropriate (including whether continued categorical\nwatchlisting may be warranted based on the nature of the threat).\n1.60 Arbitration of Watchlisting Disputes. If a NOMINATOR wishes to dispute TSC's\nwatchlisting determination, it may contact NCTC (for international TERRORIST nominations)\nto discuss the watchlisting status and/or submit additional substantive derogatory and\nidentifying information to support its initial nomination. Additional information provided to\nNCTC by a NOMINATOR will be passed to the TSC for review and final watchlisting\ndetermination. In the case of an FBI dispute over the TSC's watchlisting determination of an\ninternational TERRORIST'S nomination, a case agent must contact the TSC.\n1.61 In the case of domestic TERRORIST nominations, if the FBI wishes to dispute TSC's\nwatchlisting determination, it may contact the TSC to discuss the watchlisting status and/or\nsubmit additional substantive derogatory and identifying information to support its initial\nnomination.\nX.\n\nPROCEDURES TO REMOVE AN INDIVIDUAL FROM THE WATCHLIST\n1.62 A NOMINATOR desiring to remove an international TERRORIST identity record previously\nnominated to TIDE should contact NCTC and provide written justification for the request.\nNCTC will promptly process the request when received. NCTC will be the final arbiter of\nwhether the identity is removed from TIDE and TSC will be the final arbiter of whether\nTERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are removed from TSDB.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 27\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n1.63 If the NOMINATOR requesting removal of an international TERRORIST identity record from\nTIDE is the only NOMINATOR to have provided information on that record, the removal request\nwill be immediately processed by NCTC. The removal information is then sent to the TSC,\nwhich, in turn, makes a determination regarding removal of the TERRORIST identity from the\nTSDB.\n1.64 If multiple NOMINATORS have provided information on an international TERRORIST identity\nrecord, NCTC will coordinate with all relevant parties in an attempt to reach a consensus on\nthe TERRORIST identity's most appropriate watchlisting status.\n1.64.1 If the multiple NOMINATORS arrive at a consensus that the watchlisted identity is not\nreasonably suspected of engaging in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, or an\napplicable exception, the identity is removed from the TSDB and TIDE. In certain\ncircumstances, NCTC may retain records in TIDE to prevent inappropriate rewatchlisting.\n1.64.2 If the multiple NOMINATORS cannot arrive at a consensus regarding the watchlisting\nstatus of an identity, rI SC may decide to remove the identity from the TSDB, but NCTC\nmay retain the identity in TIDE.\n1.64.3 For cases in which the FBI has conducted an investigation on an individual\n(independently nominated by another NOMINATOR) and has concluded that the\nwatchlisted individual is not a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, the individual may be\nremoved from the TSDB. 34 In such cases, the TERRORIST IDEN TIFIERS from the FBI's\ninvestigation may be used to supplement the TIDE record.\n1.65 The FBI will review domestic\nFBI procedures.\n\nTERRORIST\n\nidentity removal requests according to applicable\n\n1.66 I SC has an established, on-going process to review every record in the TSDB in accordance\nwith Paragraph (8)(b) of the TSC MOU and its mission under IISPD-6 to maintain the most\nthorough, accurate, and current information in the TSDB. If TSC determines that the\nwatchlisting standards arc not met for an individual record, TSC will remove the record from\nthe TSDB, in coordination with the NOMINATING AGENCY.\nXI.\n\nREDRESS PROCEDURES\n1.67 In January 2005, the TSC established a formal watchlist redress process that allows Agencies\n34\n\nAfter an FBI determination that the individual is not a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, N C T C may determinebased on a NOMINATOR'S independent nomination- that the individual should remain in TIDE as records that have been\nfully vetted and should not be screened against (TIDE Category Code 140), the individual be watchlisted based upon the\nNOMINATOR'S independent determination that the individual is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST or that the individual\nwarrants watchlisting based upon an exception to the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 28\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nthat use TSDB data during a TERRORISM screening process to refer individuals' complaints to\nthe TSC if it appears the complaints may be related to the watchlisting process. The goal of\nthe watchlist redress process is to provide for timely and fair review of individuals'\ncomplaints and to identify and correct any errors in the TSDB.\n1.68 The watchlist redress process is a multi-Agency process involving the DHS, TSC, NCTC,\nNOMINATORS, and SCREENERS. On September 19, 2007, Agencics participating in the\nwatchlist redress process executed the Redress MOU to set forth a coordinated redress process\nto respond to individual complaints about adverse screening experiences.35\n1.69 TSC's Redress Office is responsible for receiving, tracking, and researching watchlist-related\ncomplaints that SCREENERS refer to TSC. For each redress complaint received, the Redress\nOffice conducts an in-depth analysis to determine if the person's complaint is related to a\nTSDB record, including a determination of whether the complainant is the watchlisted\nindividual or merely a near-match to a watchlist record. If the complainant is the watchlisted\nindividual, the TSC's Redress Office will determine whether the watchlisted individual still\nmeets all the watchlisting criteria.\n1.70 For each complaint, the TSC Redress Office coordinates with the NOMINATOR (via NCTC\nwhen the NOMINATOR is not the FBI), who assists in the evaluation of the complaint to ensure\nthe most current, accurate, and thorough information available is used to review the person's\nwatchlist status. Where appropriate and warranted by the current information and applicable\ncriteria, a person's watchlist status may be adjusted (e.g., downgraded from the No Fly to\nSelcctee List or the person's identity may be removed entirely from the TSDB). If the redress\ncomplaint was referred to the TSC from the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS\nTRIP), the individual's adjusted watchlist status will be provided to DHS TRIP for issuance of\nan appropriate response.\n1.71 DHS TRIP is a single point of contact for individuals who have inquiries or seek resolution\nregarding difficulties they experience during their travel screening or inspection at, for\nexample, transportation hubs like airports, or when crossing U.S. borders. The DHS TRIP\nwebsite is www.dhs.tiov/trip. DHS TRIP ensures a thorough review is completed by\nconsulting and sharing information with other DHS Components and other Agencies, as\nappropriate, to address the issues identified by the complainant.\nXII.\n\nPERIODIC REVIEW OF THE WATCHLISTING GUIDANCE\n1.72 This Watchlisting Guidance shall be reviewed no less than every two years following the\nconclusion of the previous review, or as needed.\n\n35\n\nSee Appendix 8, Redress MOU; see also FN 16, supra.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 29\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nCHAPTER 2: MINIMUM IDENTIFYING CRITERIA\n1.\n\nBIOMETRIC NOMINATIONS\n2.1\n\nII.\n\nBiométrie information refers to the measurable biological (anatomical or physiological) and\nbehavioral characteristics that can be used for recognition. Examples include facial\nphotographs, fingerprints, iris scans, digital images, latent prints, DNA and gait. A biométrie\nis sufficient to meet the minimum identifying criteria for nominations to the NCTC's TIDE\nand/or the TSC's TSDB, provided that the nomination also meets the minimum substantive\nderogatory criteria, or one of the exceptions. Biométrie nominations without minimum\nbiographic information will be provided only to those SCREENERS that have the technical\ncapability to screen against or otherwise make assessments using the biometrics.\nNotwithstanding the above, all N O M I N A T O R S are encouraged to include all available associated\nbiographic information with any biométrie nomination.\nMINIMUM BIOGRAPHIC NOMINATION REQUIREMENT\n\n2.2\n\nTIDE.\n\nshall provide NCTC, for inclusion into TIDE, F R A G M E N T A R Y\nthat suggests an individual may have a nexus to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST\nACTIVITIES and any additional information that will facilitate identification of these\nindividuals.

As appropriate, SCREENERS have the discretion to decide not to\ninclude in their screening systems common names received from the TSDB, where\ninsufficient identifying information exists for identification.\n\n2.4\n\nTSDB. Nominations to the TSDB must include a last name, N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C I E S should\nalso provide any additional identifying information available.

See Appendix 4. Unclassified email addresses will only be provided to\nthose SCREENERS that have the technical capability to receive this data.\n™ As required here, there must be two distinct identifiers that must be sufficiently specific to account for the large\nnumber of possible matches common identifiers may produce. For example, if one identifier is rather common (e.g.,\nphysical identifiers), the other identifier must be more specific to pemiit the screening official to successfully match a\nrecord with an individual. As a further example, a nomination with the last name listed as Khan, location listed as\nKabul, Afghanistan, and occupation listed as a baker alone would be insufficient for screening purposes because it is\nhighly unlikely a successful match could be made against such data. However, a nomination with the name listed as R.\nKhan, location listed as residence of 123 Sunshine Street, Kabul, Afghanistan, and occupation listed as a baker at ABC\nBakery, would be sufficient for screening purposes.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 31\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nIII.\n\nMINIMUM BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR EXCEPTIONS TO THE\nMINIMUM SUBSTANTIVE DEROGATORY STANDARDS FOR TERRORIST\nYVATCHL1ST1NG\n2.5\n\nThere are certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for TERRORIST\nwatchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by DI IS and DOS. 39\nExamples of these categories of records include, but may not be limited to, records relating to\nan individual who has a defined relationship with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, but\nwhose involvement with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST'S activities is unknown (TIDE\nCategory Code 50) and those with insufficient DEROGATORY INFORMATION TO meet the\nREASONABLE SUSPICION standard for watchlisting (TIDE Category Code 99).\n\n2.6\n\nNOMINATING AGENCIES\n\nshould provide all additional identifying information available.

The revised guidance was approved\nby the White House Deputies Committee on May 25, 2010 and issued to the watchlisting\ncommunity on July 16, 2010, after a multi-agency classification review.\n\n3.2\n\nThis Chapter of the Watchlisting Guidance has been updated to reflect the watchlisting\ncommunity's experiences with the Guidance since issuance in July of 2010 by the Deputies\nCommittee. One of the more notable changes of this updated version of the Watchlisting\nGuidance is the restructuring of instances for when PAR TICULARIZED D E R O G A T O R Y\nI N F O R M A T I O N is required. Another notable change includes the re-introduction of guidance\nrelative to the T E R R O R I S T facilitators or supporters from an earlier version of the Watchlisting\nGuidance and the inclusion of additional exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory\nstandards for T E R R O R I S T watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities of\nthe DOS and DHS.\n\nII.\n\nREASONABLE SUSPICION\n3.3\n\nFor purposes of watchlisting an individual to the TSDB, the N O M I N A T O R should determine\nwhether there is R E A S O N A B L E S U S P I C I O N that an individual is a K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D\nTERRORIST.40\n\n3.4\n\nR E A S O N A B L E S U S P I C I O N . To meet the R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION S t a n d a r d , the N O M I N A TOR,\nbased on the totality of the circumstances, must rely upon articulable intelligence or\ninformation which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably\nwarrants a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly\nengaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to T E R R O R I S M and/or\nT E R R O R I S T A C T I V I T I E S . There must be an objective factual basis for the N O M I N A T O R to believe\nthat the individual is a K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORIST. Mere guesses or hunches are not\nsufficient to constitute a R E A S O N A B L E S U S P I C I O N that an individual is a K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D\nT E R R O R I S T . Reporting of suspicious activity alone that does not meet the R E A S O N A B L E\nS U S P I C I O N standard set forth herein is not a sufficient basis to watchlist an individual. The\nfacts, however, given fair consideration, should sensibly lead to the conclusion that an\nindividual is, or has, engaged in T E R R O R I S M and/or T E R R O R I S T ACTIVITIES.\n\n40\n\nIn i n s t a n c e s w h e r e REASONABLE SUSPICION is n o t f o u n d , NOMINATORS s h o u l d a l s o d e t e r m i n e w h e t h e r t h e i n d i v i d u a l\nshould be n o m i n a t e d to s u p p o r t immigration and visa screening by D H S and D O S (see C h a p t e r 3, Section V).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 33\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n3.5\n\nDue Weight. In determining whether a R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION exists, due weight should be\ngiven to the specific reasonable inferences that a NOMINATOR is entitled to draw from the facts\nin light of his/her experience and not on unfounded suspicions or hunches. Although\nirrefutable evidence or concrete facts are not neccssary, to be reasonable, suspicion should be\nas clear and as fully developed as circumstances permit. For additional guidance regarding\nthe nomination of U . S . PERSONS, see Paragraph 3.15.\n\n3.6\n\nNOMINATORS\n\n3.7\n\nCriteria and Data Ouality. To demonstrate that the nomination has sufficient indicia of\nreliability to support a R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION determination, N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C I E S should\nincorporate processes designed to ensure that nominations are free of errors, and to the extent\npossible given the nature of the reporting, have not come from sources known or determined\nto be unreliable. N O M I N A T I N G AGENCIES should, to the extent possible, verify the accuracy\nand reliability of the information included in nominations. In addition to ensuring that\nnominations are free from errors, N O M I N A T I N G AGENCIES should implement procedures\ndesigned to ensure that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly, and that\nnecessary corrections to nominations based on those revisions/retractions are made.\n\n3.8\n\nshall not nominate an individual based on source reporting that N O M I N A T I N G\npersonnel identify as, or know to be, unreliable or not credible. Single source information,\nincluding but not limited to \"walk-in\", \"write-in\", or postings on social media sites, however,\nshould not automatically be discounted merely because of the manner in which it was\nreceived. Instead, the N O M I N A T I N G A G E N C Y should evaluate the credibility of the source, as\nwell as the nature and specificity of the information, and nominate even if that source is\nuncorroborated, assuming the information supports a R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION that the\nindividual is a K N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORIST or there is another basis for watchlisting the\nindividual.\n\nPARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION.\n\nPARTICULARIZED D E R O G A T O R Y\n\nis the type of information relied on to determine whether R E A S O N A B L E\nSUSPICION is met. This is information that demonstrates the nature of an individual's or\ngroup's association with TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES that is descriptive and\nspecific to an event or activity, and is more than a label. For example, \"Subject X provides\nfalse travel documentation for Al-Qaida operatives\" is PARTICULARIZED D E R O G A T O R Y\nI N F O R M A T I O N , whereas \"Subject Y is a supporter,\" standing alone, is not considered\nINFORMATION\n\nPARTICULARIZED D E R O G A T O R Y INFORMATION.\n\n3.9\n\nPotential Behavioral Indicators. In making a R E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION determination,\nN O M I N A T O R S should consider behavioral indicators known to be associated with particular\nK N O W N or S U S P E C T E D TERRORISTS. The following is a list or a few examples of those\nindicators. It is not an exclusive list and it includes activity that may have innocent\nexplanations wholly unrelated to TERRORISM. Furthermore, some activities conducted by U . S .\nPERSONS or activities taking place within the United States, may be an exercise of rights\nguaranteed by the First Amendment. Watchlisting an individual for engaging solely in\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 34\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nconstitutionally protected activities is prohibited.41 For these reasons, it is critical that each of\nthese activities—as with all possible indicators of TERRORIST ACTIVITY—not be judged in\nisolation. Each must be viewed in the context in which it occurs and considered in\ncombination with all other known information to ensure that any nomination based in whole\nor in part on this behavior comports with the standards set forth above:\n3.9.1 Attendance at training camps known to the IC as facilitating\n\nTERRORIST ACTIVITIES 42 ;\n\n3.9.2 Attendance at schools/institutions identified by the IC as teaching an ideology that\nincludes the justification of the unlawful use of violence or violent extremism;\n3.9.3 Repeated contact with individuals identified by the IC as teaching or espousing an\nideology that includes the justification of the unlawful use of violence or violent\nextremism; or,\n3.9.4 Travel for no known lawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of\nIII.\n\nTERRORIST ACTIVITY.\n\nKNOWN TERRORISTS\n3.10 Definitions.\n3.10.1\nKNOWN TERRORIST. A KNOWN TERRORIST is an individual whom the U.S.\nGovernment knows is engaged, has been engaged, or who intends to engage in\nTERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY, including an individual (a) who has been\ncharged, arrested, indicted, or convicted for a crime related to TERRORISM by U.S.\nGovernment or foreign government authorities; or (b) identified as a TERRORIST or\nmember of a designated foreign terrorist organization pursuant to statute, Executive\nOrder or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council\nResolution.\n3.10.2\n\nand/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. In general, TERRORISM and/or\nare acts that: (a) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human\nlife, property, or infrastructure that may be a violation of U.S. law, or may have been, if\nthose acts were committed in the United States; and, (b) appear intended to intimidate or\ncoerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a government by intimidation or\ncoercion, or affect the conduct of government by mass destruction, assassination,\nkidnapping, or hostage-taking. This includes activities that facilitate or support\nTERRORISM\n\nTERRORIST ACTIVITIES\n\n41\n\nSee Chapter I, Section III.\nAttendance at TERRORIST training camps alone meets the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard. Note that under the INA\nsection 212 (a)(3)(BXi)(VIII)[8 U.S.C. 1182(aX3)(BXi)(VIII)], an alien who has received military-type training (as\ndefined in section 2339D(c)(1) of Title 18, United States Code) from or on behalf of any organization that, at the time\nthe training was received, was a terrorist organization as defined in clause (vi), is inadmissible. Note also that 18 U.S.C.\nsection 2339D criminalizes receiving military type training from a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\n42\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 35\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nTERRORISM a n d / o r TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 43\n\n3.11 Types of KNOWN TERRORISTS for Whom REASONABLE SUSPICION is Established by\nRecognized Authority and for Whom Particularized Derogatory Information is Not\nRequired.\n3.11.1 Arrested or Convicted TERRORISTS. 4 4 Individuals who have been arrested or\nconvicted for TERRORIST ACTIVITY are considered KNOWN TERRORISTS who should be\nnominated. The arrest or conviction is presumed to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION\nstandard for watchlisting unless there is reason to believe that the information is\nquestionable (e.g., faulty or erroneous), of dubious origin (e.g., poison pen, source\nknown to be unreliable, or politically motivated) or the result of an unreliable process\n(e.g., conviction by a court that does not adhere to minimally acceptable due process\nstandards). Nominations should include the chargc, location, and date of the arrest or\nconviction, if available.\n3.1 1.2 Individuals Identified Pursuant to Statute or Executive Order.45 Pursuant to\nExecutive Order 13224, as amended, \"Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions\nwith Persons who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism,\" Executive\nOrder 12947, as amended, \"Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to\nDisrupt the Middle East Peace Process,\" and section 302 of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the U.S. Department of the Treasury's\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) publishes, updates, and maintains an\nintegrated and comprehensive list of designated parties with whom U.S. PERSONS are\nprohibited from providing services or conducting transactions and whose assets are\nblocked. The names on this list include persons designated under country-based and\nlist-based economic sanctions programs, as well as individuals and entities designated\nunder the various Executive Orders and Statutes aimed at TERRORISM. Persons\ndesignated under Executive Order 13224, Executive Order 12947, or the AEDPA are\nincluded on this integrated and comprehensive list and are 'Specially Designated Global\nTerrorists' (SDGTs), 'Specially Designated Terrorists' (SDTs), or 'Foreign Terrorist\n43\n\nTERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES include acts that the actor knows or reasonably should know affords\nmaterial support to any individual who the actor knows or reasonably should know, has committed or plans to commit a\nterrorist activity, to a terrorist organization or to any member of such an organization.

An\nindividual who is acquitted or against whom charges arc dismissed for a crime related to\nTERRORISM may nevertheless meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard and\nappropriately remain on, or be nominated to, the Terrorist Watchlist. 49 Each case should\nbe evaluated based on the facts of the underlying activities, the circumstances\nsurrounding the acquittal or dismissal, and all known DEROGATORY INFORMA TION to\ndetermine if the individual should remain on the Terrorist Watchlist.\n3.13.2 Individuals Identified as T E R R O R I S T S Pursuant to Other Internal Department or\nAgency Processes. Departments or Agencies that nominate individuals associated with\na terrorist group that is not designated by Statute or Executive Order (see Paragraph\n3.11.2) or groups that fall outside of the NIPF-CT construct (see Paragraph 3.11.4) must\nhave internal processes to review the activities of TERRORISTS and terrorist\norganizations. So long as a Department's or Agency's internal process has determined\nthat a group is engaging in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, REASONABLE\nSUSPICION can be met for members of the group, or active participants in, that group's\nTERRORIST ACTIVITIES. Departments and Agencies that use this clause to recommend\nsubjects for watchlisting arc required to provide written notice to NCTC and TSC (an\nemail will suffice) of the Department or Agency's determination. While members or\nactive participants of such groups may be nominated without PARTICULARIZED\nDEROGATORY INFORMATION, the watchlisting of an individual pursuant to this clause\nmust be based on the determination by a Department or Agency's internal processes that\nthe group is engaging in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. Neutral associations\nlike janitorial, repair, or delivery services of commercial goods do not meet the\nR E A S O N A B L E SUSPICION standard.\n3.13.3 Individuals Identified as T E R R O R I S T S Pursuant to Agreements by U.S.\nGovernment Agencies/Foreign Governments for Sharing of T E R R O R I S T Identity\nData. The U.S. Government may enter into agreements with foreign governments for\nthe sharing of TERRORIST identity information. Pursuant to such agreements, data will\nbe provided to the TSC for TERRORIST screening, as required under HSPD-6.

TERRORIST facilitators arc\npresumed to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard. The nomination should include\nPARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION concerning the type of \"facilitation\"\ninvolved and the role of the facilitator when this information is known. Individuals who\nare considered facilitators include, but are not limited to, financial fundraisers, document\nforgers, travel facilitators, money launderers, and arms merchants. There must be\nREASONABLE SUSPICION that the facilitator knew that his or her actions would aid in the\nfurtherance of TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\n3.13.5.1\nCriminal Activity Supporting T E R R O R I S M . If intelligence or information\nindicates that the individual is engaging in criminal activity related to smuggling,\nproviding safe houses, forging documents, or any other support to TERRORISTS or\nterrorist groups, NOMINATORS should presume that the individual is knowingly\nengaging in criminal activity that supports TERRORISM and/ or TERRORIST\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 39\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nIn these circumstances, REASONABLE SUSPICION is based on the\ncriminal activity and should be described in the nomination.\n\nACTIVI TIES.\nTERRORIST\n\n3.13.6 Individuals who Incite Others to Commit Acts of T E R R O R I S M . M Inciting an\nindividual to commit an act of TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES under\ncircumstances that indicate an intention to cause death or serious bodily harm is\nconsidered engaging in TERRORIST ACTIVITY and is sufficient to meet the REASONABLE\nSUSPICION standard. The nomination should include PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION concerning the type of \"incitement\" involved and the role of the\nindividual when this information is known. Normally, speech will not rise to the level of\n\"inciting\" unless there is a clear link between the speech and an actual effort to\nundertake the TERRORIST ACTIVITY. The individual may have incited TERRORIST\nACTIVITY, even if a terrorist attack does not actually occur (e.g., because an attempt to\ncommit such activity is thwarted). Speech advocating a violent or dangerous TERRORIST\nACTIVITY is incitement if such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent\nlawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. 52\n3.13.7 Individuals Who Solicit Others to Engage in TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. In an\nindividual capacity or as a member of an organization, any individual who solicits\nanother to engage in a TERRORIST ACTIVITY and/or for membership in a terrorist\norganization is considered to be engaging in TERRORIST ACTIVITY. Nominations that\ninclude PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION concerning the type of solicitation\ninvolved and the role of the individual are sufficient to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION\nstandard. An individual may fall outside the scope of engaging in the solicitation of an\nindividual for membership in a terrorist organization if there is information that\ndemonstrates that the individual did not know and should not have reasonably known\nthat the organization was a terrorist organization.\n3.13.8\n\nIndividuals Identified as Sympathizers and Supporters of a Designated Terrorist\nOrganization. 53 Sympathizers and supporters of a designated terrorist organization\n(DTO) (see Paragraph 3 . 1 1 . 2 ) may be watchlisted when the REASONABLE SUSPICION\nstandard is met, and the nomination includes PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION concerning the how the individual's activities warrant watchlisting, as\nopposed to information about why the organization is a DTO.\n\n3.13.8.1\nA sympathizer or supporter of TERRORISM should be nominated if the support\nis operational in nature. If support is merely ideological, the individual should not\nbe nominated.\n\n51\n\nFor situations where there is no PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION, individuals may be watchlisted as an\nexception to the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard. See Paragraph 3.14.3.\n52\nAshcroft v.

FOREIGN FIGHTERS are defined as\nnationals of one country who travel or attempt to travel to another country to participate\nin TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, and to the extent possible, the nomination\nshould include PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION. Behavior that qualifies as\nPARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION is the travel to a foreign country to\nparticipate in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\n3.13.9.1 A person is not considered a FOREIGN FIGHTER when he or she traveled from\nCountry A to Country B for non-TERRORLST reasons (e.g., enrolling in school).\nInferences that someone is a FOREIGN FIGHTER may not be drawn solely from\nbiographic facts that indicate a person was born in one country and is found in a\ndifferent country and suspected to be participating in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST\nACTIVITIES.\n\n3.13.10 Special Consideration for Individuals Involved with TERRORIST-Associated\nWeapons. Individuals who possess, handle, use, manufacture, sell, or transfer\nImprovised Explosive Devices (IBDs), Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFP),\nRadiological Dispersion Devices (RDD), or improvised chcmical, biological,\nradiological, or nuclear (CBRN) devices, are presumed to meet the REASONABLE\nSUSPICION standard due to the inherently dangerous nature of these items or when it can\nreasonably be inferred from the context that there is a connection to TERRORISM and/or\nTERRORIST ACTIVITIES (e.g., Iraq, presence of other KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS,\nprevious attacks on or threats to U.S. Forces).\n3.13.11 Targets of Raids Conducted by the U.S. Military or the Intelligence\nCommunity. REASONABLE SUSPICION is presumed where an individual was identified as\nthe target of a raid to disrupt a FTO. When an individual is identified by discovery of\ninformation found during the course of such a raid conducted by the U.S. Military or the\nIC, however, REASONABLE SUSPICION is met where the available PARTICULARIZED\nDEROGATORY INFORMATION explains why he or she can be reasonably suspected of\nengaging or having engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or\nrelated to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY. If there is no PARTICULARIZED\nDEROGATORY INFORMATION on the individual for whom information was discovered\nduring the raid, he or she should not be nominated.\n3.13.12 Individuals Identified as TERRORISTS via Documentation or Media Exploitation\nEfforts. Any individuals identified in documents or media otherwise captured by U.S.\nor allied forces or obtained from a NOMINATING AGENCY must have a connection to\nTERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES in order to be nominated to the Terrorist\nWatchlist. REASONABLE SUSPICION for an individual to be nominated from document\nand media exploitation (DOMEX) materials may be established either by the content or\ncontext of the DOMEX, or other sources. Nominations under this section must include\nPARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION. For example, REASONABLE SUSPICION for\nwatchlisting can be met based on the acquisition of documents/media identifying a\nperson from the counterterrorism operation that targeted the residence of Al-Qaida\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 41\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nleader Usama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.54 Likewise, individuals listed on a roster of an\nIED cell could be nominated solely on the presence of their name on the list. An\nidentity from a captured passport, however, would only be watchlisted if additional\nreporting documents REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that the individual is connected\nto TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY.\n3.13.13\n\nBecause the focus is on the individual's TF.RRORiSM-related conduct,\nshould be nominated when PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION and their actions support a REASONABLE SUSPICION that they are engaged\nin, or have engaged in, TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. No present known\naffiliation with a terror group, organization, or cell is required but prior affiliations, if\nthey exist, may be taken into account for supporting a rational inference that the\nindividual is reasonably suspected of engaging in TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST\nLONE WOLVES.\n\n\" L O N E W O L F \" TERRORISTS\n\nACTIVITIES.\n\nV.\n\nEXCEPTIONS TO SUPPORT IMMIGRATION AND VISA SCREENING\nACTIVITIES BY DHS AND DOS\n3.14 TSDB Minimum Substantive Derogatory Exceptions to Support Immigration and Visa\nScreening Activities by the DHS and DOS. The Watchlisting Guidance contains certain\nexceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory criteria for TERRORIST watchlisting that\nsupport immigration and visa screening activities by the D1 IS and DOS to determine whether\ngrounds exist to deny admission of aliens to the United States (including denials of visas) or to\ndeny other immigration benefits pursuant to the INA.55 PARTICULARIZED DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION is not required for nominations made pursuant to the following sections.\nBecausc the INA defines \"aliens\" as \"any person not a citizen or national of the United\nStates\" 56 , the INA admissibility provisions also apply to LPRs, in certain circumstances\nincluding those described in INA section 101(a)(13)(C)[8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(C)], who are\nconsidered as U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333. Consequently, NCTC developed a\nmechanism in TIDE to identify and distinguish U.S. citizens from non-U.S. citizens in order\nto further distinguish between \"aliens\" under the INA and U.S. PERSONS under Executive\nOrder 12333. The following subsections are exceptions to the REASONABLE SUSPICION\nstandard and will only be transmitted to DOS's CLASS (via the DOS CCD) and DI IS's WLS\nto support immigration and visa screening processes.\n\n54\n\nSuch documents/mcdia, however, still need to be reviewed to ensure that innocent individuals arc not erroneously\nwatchlisted.\n55\nINA section 212(a)(3XB)[8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)] sets forth several grounds for inadmissibility based on terrorist\nactivities, which is defined in INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(iii)[8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(BX\"i)J. For example, INA section\n212(a)(3)(B)(i)(VII) states that any alien w h o \"endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or\nespouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization\" is inadmissible to the United States. 8 U.S.C.\n1 l82(a)(3)(BXi)(VIl)]. All other uses of the term \"terrorist activities\" within this Watchlisting Guidance that do not\nspecifically reference the INA follow the definition outlined in Chapter 1 and Appendix 1.\nSee INA § 101(a)(3)[8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)],\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 42\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n3.14.1\n\nSpouses and Children.

The INA provides that the alien\nspouse or alien child of an alien who is inadmissible for ccrtain specified reasons\nrelating to terrorist activities, if the activity causing the alien to be found inadmissible\noccurred within the last five (5) years, is inadmissible.59 An alien spouse or child of an\nalien who is believed to be inadmissible under the INA for terrorist activities should be\nnominated. No additional DEROGATORY INFORMATION (in addition to familial relation)\nis required for nomination under this scction, if the individual meets the below\nqualifications.\n\n3.14.1.1\n\nTo qualify for watchlisting, alien spouses and children of a\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST must:\n\nKNOWN\n\nor\n\n3.14.1.1.1\n\nBe an alien (not a U.S. citizen or national), which includes LPRs; and,\n\n3.14.1.1.2\n\nBe an unmarried child under the age of 21 or a spouse of an alien.\n\n3.14.1.2\n\nEx-spouses, widows, or widowers should not be nominated unless there is a\nto believe that they themselves are engaging or have\nengaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to\nTERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. Deceased spouses should not be\nnominated unless they are specifically covcred in Paragraph 3.17.\nREASONABLE SUSPICION\n\n3.14.1.3 Once a spouse or child no longer meets the definitional requirements under\nthis section, such an individual should no longer be watchlisted unless there is a\nREASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that the individual is engaging in TERRORISM\nand/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. For example, if a child reaches the age of 21 and\nthere is REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe he or she was knowingly involved in\nTERRORIST ACTIVITY by providing material support to a FTO, he or she can remain\nwatchlisted based upon this DEROGATORY INFORMATION. On the other hand, once\na child of a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST turns 21 years of age, the individual\nshould no longer be watchlisted under this exception because he or she is not\nconsidered a child of the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST and additional\nDEROGATORY INFORMATION would be needed to meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION\nstandard.\n\" T h e INA defines \"child\" as \"an unmarried person u n d e r 2 1 years of a g e . . . . \" INA § 1 0 !

While this provision does not apply when the activity\ncausing the alien to be found inadmissible occurred more than 5 years before the spouse or c h i l d ' s admissibility is being\nconsidered, the analysis of the time limit's application will be determined by SCREENERS upon ENCOUNTER.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 43\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n3.14.2 Endorsers and Espousers.

Inciting an individual to commit an act of TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST\nunder circumstances that indicate an intention to cause death or serious bodily\nharm is considered engaging in TERRORIST ACTIVITY. The individual may be\ninadmissible under the INA and should be nominated.\n\nACTIVITY\n\n3.14.4 Supporters of a Designated Terrorist Organization. Supporters of a DTO may be\ninadmissible under the INA and should be nominated if the support is operational in\nnature.

On January 10, 2005, the DHS released the No Fly and Selectee Lists\nImplementation Guidance (Implementation Guidance) to provide direction on how to\nimplement the No Fly and Selectee List criteria. The Implementation Guidance was updated\nand supplemented on July 25, 2006.\n\n4.2\n\nOn February 8, 2008, the Deputies Committee approved the addition of a third and fourth\ncriterion to the No Fly List. The Terrorist Screening Center Policy Board Working Group' 9\nrevised the Implementation Guidance on March 5, 2008, to provide direction on how to\nimplement these new criteria.\n\n4.3\n\nFollowing the attempted TERRORIST attack on December 25, 2009, the President directed that\na review of the current No Fly and Selectee List criteria be conducted and recommendations\nbe made regarding whether any adjustments were needed. The Terrorist Screening Center\nPolicy Board Working Group, in conjunction with the Information Sharing Access IPC,\nrecommended certain changes in the lists' criteria and implementation guidance. Those\nrecommendations were approved by the Deputies Committee on July 16, 2010.\n\n11.\n\nPRE-CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT ON THE NO FLY OR SELECTEE\nLIST\n\n4.4\n\nGenerally, in order to be included on cither the No Fly or Selectee List, two pre-conditions\nmust both be met:\n4.4.1 Minimum Identifying Criteria. Absent a Special Situation as described below' 0 ,\nminimum identifying biographic criteria consisting of First Name, Last Name, Full Date\nof Birth are required; and,\n4.4.2 Minimum Substantive Derogatory Criteria. The minimum substantive derogatory\ncriteria for inclusion must be met.71\n\n69\n\nThis Working Group included representatives from Department of State, Department o f Justice, Department of\nHomeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, Transportation Security\nAdministration, National Countcrterrorism Center, Terrorist Screening Center, Department of Treasury, and U.S.\nCustoms and Border Protection.\n70\nSee Chapter 4, Section IX, for additional information regarding the full date o f birth requirement and applicable\nexceptions.\n\" See Paragraph 1.58 for expedited nominations procedures.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 50\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nIII.\n\nNO FLY LIST CRITERIA\n4.5\n\nAny person, regardless of citizenship, who represents:\n4.5.1 a threat of committing an act of \"international TERRORISM\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C.\n2331(1)) or \"domestic TERRORISM\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(5)) with respect to an\naircraft (including a threat of air piracy, or a threat to airline, passenger, or civil aviation\nsecurity); or,\n4.5.2\n\na threat o f c o m m i t t i n g a n a c t o f \" d o m e s t i c TERRORISM\" ( a s d e f i n e d in 18\n\n2331(5))\n\nU.S.C.\n\nw i t h r e s p e c t t o t h e h o m e l a n d 7 2 ; or,\n\n4.5.3 a threat of committing an act of \"international TERRORISM\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C.\n2331(1)) against any U.S. Government facility abroad and associated or supporting\npersonnel, including U.S. embassies, consulates and missions, military installations (as\ndefined by 10 U.S.C. 2801(c)(4)), U.S. ships, U.S. aircraft, or other auxiliary craft\nowned or leased by the U.S. Government; or,\n4.5.4 a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of TERRORISM and who is\nOPERATIONALLY CAPABLE 7 3 of doing SO.\n4.6\n\nIV.\n\nDetainees at the Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Any individual who was a\n\"detainee\" held at the Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, unless the President certifies in\nwriting to Congress that the detainee poses no threat to the United States, its citizcns, or its\nallies. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"detainee\" means an individual in the\ncustody or under the physical control of the United States as a result of armed conflict. 74\n\nFURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE NO FLY CRITERIA\n4.7\n\nThird No Fly List Criterion. Prior to the addition of the third No Fly List criterion (see\nParagraph 4.5.3), a concern over the breadth of the No Fly List arose when KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS who posed a threat to a U.S. military base overseas did not meet the\ncriteria for inclusion on the No Fly List. Despite national interests, the threat to the overseas\nmilitary base did not involve either civil aviation (as set forth in the first No Fly List criterion)\nor an act of domestic TERRORISM to the homeland (as set forth in the second No Fly List\ncriterion). \"Domestic Terrorism\" requires that a subject's TERRORIST ACTIVITIES occur\nprimarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. \"Homeland\" does not include\nbases and embassies located abroad. Even in those instances when the IC had identified a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST'S Specific target, KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS\nmaintained the advantage of operational flexibility. The third No Fly List criterion addresses\n\n72\n\nDomestic acts of TERRORISM are those that primarily occur \"within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"\nSee 18 U.S.C. 2331(5)(C).\n73\nSee Paragraph 4.8.2, infra, that defines \"OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE.\"\n74\nSee 49 U.S.C. 44903(j)(2)(C)(v).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 51\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nthis specific vulnerability and counters the ability of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS to\ntarget U.S. Government facilities outside of the \"homeland\" (e.g., the October 12, 2000 attack\nupon the U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer USS Cole while it was harbored in the Yemeni\nport of Aden).\n4.8\n\nFourth No Fly List Criterion.\n4.8.1 Enable Flexibility. The fourth No Fly List criterion (see Paragraph 4.5.4) is intended to\nenable flexibility for nominations to the No Fly List of OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who pose a threat of committing an act of\ninternational TERRORISM abroad, but who do not meet the first, second or third No Fly\nList criterion because they do not pose a threat to civil aviation, a threat to the homeland,\nor a threat to U.S. facilities and their associated or supporting personnel. Previously, the\nNo Fly List criteria did not prevent KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS from traveling\naboard aircraft, even though they may have had the intent and OPERA TIONAL CAPABILITY\nto commit a TERRORIST act against U.S. nationals abroad (outside of the \"homeland\") or\nagainst a target with no nexus to the United States or its nationals. The fourth No Fly\nList criterion now addresses these two vulnerabilities.\n4.8.2\n\nDefined. An individual is \"OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE\" if,\nbased on credible intelligence, he or she, acting individually or in concert with others,\nreasonably appears to have the ability, knowledge, opportunity, and intent or is actively\nseeking the opportunity to engage in a violent act of TERRORISM consistent with 18\nU.S.C. 2331 or 18 U.S.C. 2332b. For example, attempting to obtain an 1ED would\nindicate an individual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE of committing an act of TERRORISM.\nHowever, simply conducting internet research concerning lEDs would not be sufficient\nwithout additional activity. Depending on the circumstances, and in combination with\nother facts, scouting potential targets or traveling for no legitimate purpose to places that\nhave TERRORIST training grounds, regardless of whether the person is presently capable\nof using an IED, might also indicate an individual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE of\ncommitting an act of TERRORISM.\nOPERATIONALLY CAPABLE\n\n4.8.3 Possible Indicators of Being OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE. In determining whether an\nindividual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE, consideration should be given to the following\nindicators regarding ability, knowledge, opportunity, and/or intent:\nSubject has undergone TERRORIST training or been provided some instruction,\nto includc receiving military training by a designated terrorist group;\n\n4.8.3.1\n\n4.8.3.2\n\nSubject has indicated intent to participate in planning/conducting an attack;\n\n4.8.3.3\n\nSubject has expressed desire to martyr him/herself;\n\n4.8.3.4\nSubject is in repeated contact with a\nrecruits or facilitates travel of operatives;\n4.8.3.5\n\nKNOWN TERRORIST\n\nfacilitator who\n\nSubject is planning an attack either alone or as part of a group; or,\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 52\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nSubject is associated with a TERRORIST group/cell and the subject is\naccumulating weapons/explosives.\n\n4.8.3.6\n\n4.9\n\nScenarios. The three scenarios set forth below serve as some\nexamples of No Fly List nominations that would fall under the fourth No Fly List criterion:\nOPERATIONALLY CAPABLE\n\n4.9.1 There is credible information that the planning or preparation for a TERRORIST attack\nagainst the interests of the United States or a foreign government is ongoing and there is\nan indication that an individual is OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE;\n4.9.2 There is credible information that an individual is linked with an organization known to\ntarget U.S. interests. The actual target may be unknown but indicated to be a\ncommercial facility frequented by U.S. citizens abroad. Intelligence identifies an\noperational or pre-operational capability of this individual whose cell is planning a nearterm attack on a target {e.g., a plot to kill U.S. nationals residing in a foreign hotel or\nfrequenting a foreign nightclub); or,\n4.9.3 There is credible information that an individual is linked with an organization known to\ntarget foreign governments. The actual target may be unknown but indicated to be a\nforeign government facility such as an embassy, consulate, mission or military\ninstallation. Intelligence identifies an operational or pre-operational capability of this\nindividual whose cell is planning a near-term attack on a target {e.g., a plot to bomb the\nBritish Parliament or the March 11, 2004, Madrid bombing).\n4.10 One-Time Waiver Policy.\n4.10.1 TSA regulations prohibit U.S. flagged air carriers and foreign flagged air carriers\nfrom transporting individuals, who pose the level of threat required for No Fly status, on\nregulated commercial flights, including all flights operated by U.S. air carriers\nregardless of the location, and flights operated by foreign air carriers to, from, or over\nthe United States. This prohibition applies regardless of the individual's status as a U.S.\nPERSON.\n\nWhen necessary, the U.S. Government may authorize and grant a One Time Waiver\n(OTW) to an air carrier permitting the carrier to transport an individual on a specified\nitinerary under controlled conditions. OTWs are coordinated with DHS (including CBP\nand TSA), FBI, DOS and DOJ as appropriate, prior to being authorized by TSC. Once\nauthorized by TSC, TSA will review the conditions of transport and may grant the\nwaiver, permitting the air carrier to transport the individual. If the itinerary changes, or\nthe conditions of transport of the individual change, TSA will deny boarding to the\nindividual until such time as satisfactory conditions are present.\n\n4.10.2\n\n4.10.3\n\nU.S. PERSONS\n\n4.10.3.1\n\nEncountered Overseas.\n\nWhile placement on the No Fly List does not legally bar a\n\nU.S. P E R S O N\n\nfrom\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 53\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nreturning to the United States, the U.S. Government has adopted a policy to review\nall cases in which a U.S. PF.RSON on the No Fly List is denied boarding on a\ncommercial flight bound for the United States to determine whether an OTW may\nbe appropriate. TSC will initiate this assessment immediately, and may approve an\nOTW in advance. TSA will not review or authorize an OTW until such time as an\nacceptable itinerary is available.\n4.10.3.2 In order to facilitate communication with such an individual, the U.S. Government\nhas determined, as a matter of policy, that U.S. Citizens denied boarding on a\ncommercial flight returning to the United States should be referred to the consular\nsection of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate, which will facilitate communication\nwith the individual, including providing the individual with instructions in the event an\nOTW is authorized. In keeping with the U.S. Government's traditional policy of neither\nconfirming nor denying whether an individual is on the Terrorist Watchlist, the\nindividual is not informed of his or her watchlist status or that he or she would be\ntraveling under a waiver.\n\nV.\n\nSELECTEE LIST CRITERIA\n4.11 Selectee List Criteria. Any person regardless of citizenship, who does not meet the criteria\nfor inclusion on the No Fly List and who:\nis a member of a foreign or domestic T E R R O R I S T organization 73 (including a \"foreign\nT E R R O R I S T organization\" designated pursuant to Statute or Executive Order, as described\nin Paragraph 3.11.2); and,\n\n4.11.1\n\n4.11.2 is associated with \" T E R R O R I S T A C T I V I T Y \" (as such term is defined in section\n212(a)(3)(B) of the INA [8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)l); unless information exists that\ndemonstrates that the application of secondary screening to such person is not necessary,\nin which case such persons may be excluded from the Selectee List.\n\nVI.\n\nEXPANDED SELECTEE LIST CRITERIA\n4.12 The Expanded Selectee List (ESEL) includes records in the TSDB that contain a full name\nand full date of birth, regardless of the citizenship of the subject, who do not meet the criteria\nto be placed on either the No Fly or Selectee Lists, excluding exceptions to the R E A S O N A B L E\nS U S P I C I O N standard.\n\nVII.\n\nACTIONS BASED UPON POSITIVE MATCHES TO THE NO FLY,\nSELECTEE, OR EXPANDED SELECTEE LISTS\n\n75\n\nM e m b e r s o f a defunct terrorist group are included in this criterion if the person w a s a m e m b e r o f the group when it\nparticipated in TERRORIST ACTIVITY.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 54\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n4.13 The actions resulting from inclusion on the No Fly, Selectee, or Expanded Selectcc List are\ngenerally as follows:\n4.13.1 Individuals that are\nboarding an aircraft;\n\nPOSITIVE MATCHES\n\nto the No Fly Listare prohibited from\n\n4.13.2 Individuals that are POSITIVE MATCHES to the Sclcctee List undergo enhanced\nscreening prior to boarding an aircraft;\n4.13.3 Individuals that are POSITIVE MATCHES to the Expanded Selectee List undergo\nenhanced screening prior to boarding an aircraft.\n4.14 Selectcc, Expanded Selectee, and random screening all result in the same operational response\nof receiving enhanced screening by Transportation Security Officers prior to boarding an\naircraft. TSA will notify the TSC of all No Fly, Selectee, and Expanded Selectee\nENCOUNTERS.\n\nVIII.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES\n4.15 General Guidelines. The watchlisting community has developed six general guidelines\nregarding the No Fly and Selectee Lists that should be rcemphasi/.ed in order to effectively\nimplement the No Fly List and Selectee List criteria. The six general guidelines are:\n4.15.1\nWhen evaluating the significance, relevancc and validity of a threat, careful\nconsideration should be given to the extent to which the threat is current, specific and\ncredible.\n4.15.2\nThe Selectee List is not a default position for those who do not qualify for inclusion\non the No Fly List and has distinct elements that must be met before an individual may\nbe included.\n4.15.3 The purpose of the No Fly List is to protect against acts of TERRORISM; inclusion on\nthe No Fly List has consequenccs that arc operational, legal, economic, and diplomatic.\n4.15.4 Except for expedited nominations made pursuant to Paragraph 1.58 of the\nWatchlisting Guidance, the decision to include a person on the No Fly List or Selectcc\nList must include substantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION that satisfies the\naforementioned criteria and thus justifies inclusion on either list. In cases where\nnominations contain no substantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION, or contain insufficient\nsubstantive DEROGATORY INFORMATION, the individual will not be included on either the\nNo Fly List or Selectee List.\n4.15.5 In accordance with determinations made pursuant to Paragraph 1.59 of the\nWatchlisting Guidance, the White House may direct the TSC to place categories of\nindividuals on the No Fly List or the Selectee List on a temporary basis based on current\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 55\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\na n d c r e d i b l e i n t e l l i g e n c e i n f o r m a t i o n o r a p a r t i c u l a r t h r e a t s t r e a m that i n d i c a t e s a c e r t a i n\nc a t e g o r y o f i n d i v i d u a l s m a y c o n d u c t a n a c t o f d o m e s t i c o r i n t e r n a t i o n a l TERRORISM.\n\n4.15.6 Under exigent operational circumstances, when DEROGATORY INFORMATION may not\nbe widely disseminated or stored in FIDE, individual watchlist status determinations can\nbe made by the Director of the TSC, in accordance with the relevant criteria76 contained\nin the Watchlisting Guidance. Coordination should occur with relevant NOMINATING\nAGENCIES a n d SCREENERS.\n\n4.16 Totality of the Information. The foregoing guidance is neither intended to be determinative\nnor intended to serve as a checklist. Rather, it is intended to guide the watchlisting\ncommunity in assessing whether the established criteria are satisfied for a specific record,\nbased on the totality of available information, a current threat stream, and/or the current threat\nenvironment.\n\nSPECIAL SITUATIONS 77\n\nIX.\n\n4.17\n\nRequirement for Full Names and Complete Dates of Birth. Generally, TERRORIST\nidentities nominated to either the No Fly or the Selectee List must have both a full name and a\ncomplete date of birth. Identities without both will usually not be included on either list.\nDates of birth shall not be fabricated.78\n4.17.1 There is, however, a narrow exception to the requirement for full names and\ncomplete dates of birth for individuals from non-Visa Waiver Program countries for\ninternational TERRORIST nominations. If a non-Visa Waiver Program country7'' has\nissued a travel document with only a year of birth, or a verified government-issued\nidentification document with only a year of birth, then it is permissible to use only that\nyear of birth. The NOMINATING AGENCY, however, should, whenever possible, specify\nthe type of document containing the year of birth, and the passport number (if the\ndocument is a passport). Otherwise, a year of birth alone will not be accepted for\nnominations to the No Fly or Selectee Lists. The NOMINATING AGENCY has a continuing\nobligation to attempt to determine the complete date of birth.\n\n4.18 Expedited Waiver of \"Full Date of Birth\" Requirement for No Fly or Selectee\nNominations. When necessitated by exigent circumstances, a NOMINATOR may nominate an\nindividual or individuals to the No Fly or Selectee List with only a partial date of birth, but for\nwhom there is additional identifying information. This provision is intended to enable\nnominations based on current and credible intelligence information or a particular threat\n\n\" Determinations made under this section apply to the No Fly, Selectee and Expanded Selectee List criteria.\nSee Paragraph 1.59 for a complete discussion of expedited nomination procedures for temporary, threat-based\ncategories.\n78\nThe dates o f birth o f January 1 (01/0I/xxxx), July I (07/01/xxxx), November 11(11/11/xxxx), and December 31\n(12/31/xxxx) are examples o f dates that may be fabricated and as such, should receive additional scrutiny at all stages of\nthe reporting, nomination, and watchlisting process.\n\" Visa Waiver Program countries include a complete date of birth in their passports.\n77\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 56\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nstream that indicates the subject(s) may be used to conduct an act of domestic or international\nterrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331 (1), or as a Federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18\nU.S.C. 2332b(g)(5). The goal of this provision is to fashion a watchlisting response that is\nappropriate to the nature, specificity, and severity of the threat. To achieve this goal, in\naddition to the credibility of the threat intelligence, due consideration should be given to:\n4.18.1\n\nThe harm to public safety posed by the threat;\n\n4.18.2 The clarity and specificity of the information giving rise to the threat as to time,\nplace, method, and identity of the suspcctcd perpetrator(s);\n4.18.3 The anticipated impact on international and domestic travel, civil liberties,\nand foreign relations; and,\n4.18.4 The best available screening tools, other than the No Fly or Selectee Lists, given the\ntype and specificity of identifiers and travel data.\n4.19 This waiver should be utilized in limited circumstances when extreme DEROGATORY\nINFORMATION has been identified demonstrating the threat. The waiver should be valid as\nlong as the threat remains.\n\nX.\n\nNOMINATIONS THAT ARE INELIGIBLE/NOT SUITABLE FOR EITHER\nTHE NO FLY OR THE SELECTEE LIST 80\n4.20 Nominations based on exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory criteria contained in\nParagraph 3.14, including immediate family members of TFIRRORISTS (i.e., spouses or children\nof a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST) 8 1 are ineligible/not suitable for inclusion on either the\nNo Fly or Selectee List, absent independent DEROGATORY INFORMATION;\n4.21 Subjects of lost or stolen passports or travel documents arc ineligible/not suitable for inclusion\non either the No Fly or Selectee List, absent independent DEROGATORY INFORMATION;\n4.22 Deceased individuals are ineligible for inclusion on either the No Fly or Selectee List unless\nthey meet the exceptions set forth in Paragraph 3.17, Identities of Deceased Individuals.\n\n80\n\nThis section can be overridden in the event of an expedited, threat-based categorical nomination procedures, pursuant\nto Paragraph 1.59.\n81\nSee INA § 212(a)(3XB)(i)(IX)[8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX)].\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 57\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\nCHAPTER 5: ENCOUNTER MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE\n5.1\n\nThis guidance addresses the collection, processing, and analysis of TERRORISM INFORMATION\ncollected by the SCREENERS during an ENCOUNTER with a watchlisted subject. As described\nbelow, all information gathered during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST 82 is referred to as an ENCOUNTER PACKAGE. This guidance does not crcate any\nnew authorities for the collection of any information during ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS. Rather, it identifies the types of information that a Department or\nAgency should consider collecting during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST if it possesses the authority to collect such information, and should share with the\ninteragency community consistent with their legal authorities and executive policy.81\n\n5.2\n\nDefinitions.\n5.2.1\n\nENCOUNTER. An ENCOUNTER is defined as an event in which an individual is identified\nduring a screening process to be a \"POSITIVE MATCH,\" \"POTENTIAL MATCH,\" or\n\"INCONCLUSIVE MATCH,\" to an individual who has been designated in the TSDB as a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. An ENCOUNTER can be a face-to-face meeting with a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, electronic or a paper-based ENCOUNTER (e.g., the\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST has submitted an application for a benefit liked a visa,\nElectronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application, or information is\nprovided to the United States by a foreign government, aircraft operator, or other private\nentity). Chapter 5 is only concerned with POSITIVE MATCHES, which occur when the\nI S C d e t e r m i n e s t h a t i n f o r m a t i o n a b o u t a s u b j e c t e n c o u n t e r e d b y a SCREENER m a t c h e s a\n\nTSDB\n5.2.2\n\nrecord.\n\nin this chapter includes purely\ndomestic terrorism as defined in the T5C MOU and incorporates the definition found in\nin section 1016 of the 1RTPA (6 U.S.C 485), as amended. The term \"TERRORISM\nINFORMATION\" means -\n\nTERRORISM INFORMATION. TERRORISM INFORMATION\n\n5.2.2.1\nall information, whether collected, produced, or distributed by intelligence,\nlaw enforcement, military, homeland security, or other activities relating to—\n5.2.2.1.1\nthe existence, organization, capabilities, plans, intentions,\nvulnerabilities, means of finance or material support, or activities of foreign\nor international terrorist groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or\n32\n\nSharing information for reasons not related to KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST categories should be limited to\nupdating biographic identifiers, and the sharing of relevant information that may assist in making decisions related to a\nchange in a p e r s o n ' s status in the T S D B and/or TERRORISM INFORMA HON.\n33\nObligations include those imposed by IRTPA section 1021 or by interagency agreement (e.g., the Information\nSharing MOU (Appendix 5), the TSC MOU (Appendix 3) and Addendum B to the TSC MOU (Appendix 4)).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 58\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\ni n d i v i d u a l s i n v o l v e d in t r a n s n a t i o n a l TERRORISM;\n\n5.2.2.1.2\n\nthreats posed by such groups or individuals to the United States, U.S.\nor U.S. interests, or to those of other nations;\n\nPERSONS,\n\n5.2.2.1.3\n\ncommunications of or by such groups or individuals; or,\n\n5.2.2.1.4\ngroups or individuals reasonably believed to be assisting or associated\nwith such groups or individuals; and\n\n5.2.2.2\n\nincludes w e a p o n s o f mass destruction information.\n\n5.2.2.2.1 Weapons of Mass Destruction Information. Information that could\nreasonably be expected to assist in the development, proliferation, or use of a\nweapon of mass destruction (including a chemical, biological, radiological, or\nnuclear weapon) that could be used by a TERRORIST or a terrorist organization\nagainst the United States, including information about the location of any stockpile\nof nuclcar materials that could be exploited for use in such a weapon that could be\nused by a TERRORIST or a terrorist organization against the United States.\n\nII.\n\nPROCESSING TERRORISM INFORMATION FROM ENCOUNTERS\nWITH POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED KNOWN OR SUSPECTED\nTERRORISTS\n5.3\n\nThis section describes the major types of ENCOUNTERS by various Departments and Agencies.\nobtained from a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTER will be\nprocessed as follows:\nENCOUNTER PACKAGES\n\n5.4\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security ENCOUNTERS. DI IS has more ENCOUNTERS with\nor SUSPECTED TERRORISTS than any other U.S. Government component. The\ndescriptions below provide information for the majority of DHS ENCOUNTERS, although it is\nnot an exhaustive list of ENCOUNTER opportunities or the types of TERRORISM INFORMATION\navailable for collection. When lawful and available, both biographic and biométrie\ninformation will be collected as part of the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE.\nKNOWN\n\n5.4.1 U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP ENCOUNTERS occur at ports of entry\n(POL), between POEs, or at the last point of departure to the United States at foreign\nairports through CBP programs like Pre-Clearance and the Immigration Advisory\nProgram (IAP). Information available for collection from these ENCOUNTERS may\ninclude, but is not limited to, pocket litter, travel information, identification documents,\ntravel companions, legal documents, and other information gathered during interviews\nand the examination process. CBP receives international travel reservation information\nof KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS for commercial air travel to and from the United\nStates (which may include travel companion information) and international private and\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 59\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\ncommercial flight manifests, as well as, commercial vessel manifest for travel to and\nfrom the United States. With the exception of passenger information required by law to\nbe transmitted to DHS prior to a passenger's arrival, most information is generally\ncollected by CBP when the person is interviewed or apprehended. The National\nTargeting Center - Passenger (NTC-P) and NTC-Cargo (NTC-C) are CBP entities\nresponsible for communicating with the TSC regarding ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or\n84\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS, to include providing relevant ENCOUNTER information.\nNTCP and NTC-C also provide a copy of the examination results to the TSOU for\ndissemination to the appropriate investigating Agencies.\n5.4.2 Transportation Security Administration. TSA generally encounters KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS through screening commercial aircraft passengers against\nsubsets of the TSDB and during the application process for a credential or benefit in the\ntransportation or critical infrastructure environment (e.g., Transportation Worker\nIdentification Credential (TWIC)). When an airline encounters subjects who arc\npossible matches to the No Fly or Selectee List, the air carriers arc required to supply the\npassenger's name and one piece of identifying data (in the form of a government-issued\nphoto identification that contains a date of birth) to the TSA's Office of Intelligence and\nAnalysis (OIA). TSA OIA submits that information, along with information regarding\nthe carrier, flight number, time of departure, and destination to the TSC.\n5.4.2.1\n\nAbsent an arrest warrant, or unless probable cause arises during the\nare reminded that placement on the No Fly or Selectee\nList is not a legal basis to detain a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. T O the\nextent legal authority exists to question a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST,\nencounters with No Fly subjects at the airport may provide an additional\nopportunity to lawfully obtain ENCOUNTER PACKAGE information. For No Fly\nsubjects who have made a domestic reservation, DHS will notify TSC in advance\nas well as when the No Fly subject presents at the airport ticket countcr. TSC will\nthen notify the T S O U who will notify both the FBI case agent and the airport\nliaison agent to coordinate the appropriate operational response.\nENCOUNTER, SCREENERS\n\n5.4.2.2\nFor KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTERS as a result of an\nindividual applying for a TSA benefit or credential, ENCOUNTER PACKAGE\ninformation can include any supporting documents or information collected as a\npart of the application process. The ENCOUNTER, and any corresponding\ninformation, is communicated to the TSC and other Government Agencies, as\nappropriate through TSA OIA.\n5.4.3 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. U.S. Citizenship and\nImmigration Services (USCIS) interact with millions of individuals every year and\nu\n\nC B P may also encounter such individuals in the course of processing an application and/or conducting an interview\nof an applicant for a trusted traveler program (e.g., N E X U S , Free and Secure Trade (FAST), Global Entry, SF.NTRI,\netc.).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 60\n\n\fUNCLASSJFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nor SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who file petitions or applications for\nimmigration benefits internationally and domestically.85 The USCIS official contacts\nthe TSC to report an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Before\nmaking a decision on the immigration application or benefit, USCIS contacts the\nORIGINATOR/NOMINATOR to obtain additional information that may help determine\nwhether the individual is eligible or ineligible to receive the immigration benefit. In\nsuch cases, USCIS seeks further information from the record owner or case agent and\nmay seek de-classification of information relating to the application. In addition, USCIS\ncontacts the ORIGINATOR/NOMINATOR to discuss whether the USCIS decision to grant or\ndeny the application or benefit would interrupt or negatively affect any ongoing\ninvestigation.\nENCOUNTERS KNOWN\n\n5.4.3.1\nUSCIS maintains a presence at law enforcement and intelligence Agency\nentities to further information sharing regarding KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORISTS. USCIS maintains information, including the subject's Alien File (AFile) and other records. The type of information that may be contained in USCIS\nfiles, including the A-File, could be biometric data (fingerprints and photographs);\nidentity documents; information relating to the application; addresses, as well as\nfamily and work history information; immigration benefit application information;\nand records of previous ENCOUNTERS that DHS has had with the subject. Other\nSCREENERS — as well as other appropriate organizations who are considering\nnominating a potential KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST or who have ENCOUNTERS\nwith a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST— are\nadvised that they can request, on a casc-by-case basis, a copy of the KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST'S A-File from USCIS if the KNOWN or SUSPECTED\n86\nTERRORIST has applied for immigration or citizenship benefits.\n5.4.4 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Immigrations and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) is the principal investigative arm of DHS. ICE is also the federal\nlaw enforcement organization responsible for immigration and customs-related\ninvestigations and detention within the interior and at the borders of the United States.\nICE frequently ENCOUNTERS potential KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS during\nenforcement activities under its purview. Such ENCOUNTERS are documented within ICE\nEnforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) via the Known Suspected Terrorist\nEncounter Protocol and reported to the TSC and ICE's Homeland Security\nInvestigations (HSI). ICE HSI Special Agents frequently encounter KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS internationally, domestically, at U.S. POEs, and when KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORISTS are the subjects of an ICE investigation. These ENCOUNTERS are\n85\n\nFor example, a U.S. PERSON who is a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST may file a petition for a foreign national or a\nU.S. PERSON w h o is not a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST may file a petition for a foreign national who is a KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST.\n86\nBecause USCIS is the custodian of information acquired through the immigration process relating to an individual\nand because the A-File is not routinely attached to the T S D B or TIDE, a specific request to USCIS is necessary in order\nto obtain information from the A-File.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage I 61\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\ndocumented by HSI Special Agents in Reports of Investigation (ROI). All ROls\ndocumenting ENCOUNTERS/interviews with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST are\nshared with the IC.\n5.4.4.1\nIn addition, under section 428 of the Homeland Security Act, the Secretary of\nHomeland Security has the authority to refuse visas in accordance with the law and\nto assign employees of DHS to diplomatic and consular posts to review visa\napplications and conduct investigations.87 ICE, through the Visa Security\nProgram, exercises this authority. Reviews of visa applications and interviews\nwith applicants can result in the encounter of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS,\nfacilitators, and associates as well as reveal previously unknown information\nrelating to KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. HSI personnel assigned to the Visa\nSecurity Program, and to U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad, work closely\nwith their DOS counterparts to identify KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS and\nreport findings through established processes. Finally, ICE may encounter KNOWN\nor SUSPECTED TERRORISTS awaiting immigration hearings who are housed in\nservice processing/detention centers. These detention facilities can document\ninteractions with the aliens while they are detained in the facility, as well as\ndocument materials found on the individual at the time of processing. For all\nimmigration and enforcement activities, ICE will communicate with the TSC\nregarding encounters with watchlisted individuals, and will submit relevant\nENCOUNTER information to the TSC.\n5.4.5 United States Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard's Coastwatch branch screens crew\nand passenger information on vessel manifests, which are required by regulation to be\ntransmitted to the National Vessel Movement Center (NVMC) prior to a vessel's arrival\nin a U.S. port. Coastwatch communicates with the NTC-P and TSC regarding any\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTERS during this process. The Coast Guard\nphysically encounters few KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, and such ENCOUN TERS\ncould occur from random and regular inspections of vessels and port facilities, ship\nboardings, investigations, or Coast Guard licensing activities. The type of information\navailable for collection is dependent on the type of ENCOUNTER. The ENCOUNTER, and\nany corresponding information, is communicated to the TSC through Coast Guard\nOffice of Intelligence and Criminal Investigations. Based on the encountering situation,\nintelligence reporting will be written to provide situational awareness to the IC.\n5.4.6 United States Secret Service. Although United States Secret Service (USSS) docs not\nencounter many KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, such ENCOUNTERS usually involve\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS with a domestic nexus to TERRORISM. Such\nencounters can be the result of investigations or for event screening (e.g., National\nSecurity Special Events, political events, large scale sporting events). These\ns/\n\nConsistent with section 428 of the Homeland Security Act and the Memorandum\n\nof Understanding\n\nbetween\n\nthe\n\nSecretaries of Slate and Homeland Security Concerning Implementation ofSection 428 of the Homeland Security Act of\n2002, the Secretary o f I lomeland Security may direct a consular officer to refuse or revoke a visa.\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 62\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nENCOUNTERS\n\nwill be coordinated with the FBI, who will handle them as they do all other\n\nF B I KNOWN o r SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTERS.\n\n5.4.7 Department of Homeland Security Intelligence & Analysis. DHS I&A provides end\nproducts and analytical reports, which are generally available to the NCTC and the\nbroader counterterrorism analytic community, including fusion centers. DHS I&A\nworks closely with DHS components to ensure non-traditional streams of information\nare fused with traditional sources of information from other members of the IC to give a\ncomplete picture of potential threats to the nation. DHS I&A \"connects the dots\" for\nintelligence reporting and ENCOUNTERS of the DHS components, and as such, has\nlimited opportunity for ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.\n5.5\n\nDepartment of State E N C O U N T E R S . For DOS ENCOUNTERS with a person who is a POSITIVE\nMATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, the DOS unit at the TSC will do the following:\n5.5.1 Visa Applications. DOS/TSC will upload the electronic visa application from the CCD\nto the individual's EMA record. DOS/TSC will coordinate with the overseas posts to\nscan in CCD all other available DOS documents associated with the individual. DOS\ninformation about whether a visa is issued is currently available in individual case\nrecords in the CCD; DOS is currently investigating upgrades to the CCD's report\nfunction that will make the visa decision data more easily accessible to TSC and other\nusers.\n5.5.2 Visa Revocations. DOS/TSC will upload the electronic visa application from the CCD\nto the individual's EMA record.\n5.5.3 Passports. After encounters with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS possessing\npassports issued by the United States, the TSOC will upload the Passport Information\nElectronic Records System (PIERS) application forms from the CCD to the individual's\nEMA record. DOS/TSC will coordinate with the overseas posts to scan in CCD all other\navailable DOS documents associated with the individual.\n\n5.6\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development E N C O U N T E R S . United States Agency\nfor International Development (USAID) works in agriculture, democracy and governance,\neconomic growth, the environment, education, health, global partnerships, and humanitarian\nassistance in more than 100 countries. When USAID receives an application seeking financial\nassistance, prior to granting, these applications are subject to vetting by USAID intelligence\nanalysts at the TSC. If USAID/TSC finds that an application relates to a person who is a\nPOSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST in the TSDB, USAID/TSC will provide\nany TERRORISM INFORMATION concerning the application and follow standard TSC procedures\nfor processing TERRORISM INFORMATION, to include logging the ENCOUNTER in EMA.\n\n5.7\n\nForeign Partner E N C O U N T E R S . After each ENCOUNTER by a foreign partner, DOS/TSC will\nask the respective country for the subject's photo, additional biographic data and any\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 63\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\non the ENCOUNTER Information List gathered during the\nProvision of any material collected by the foreign partner depends on the\narrangement with, and legal authorities of, the particular foreign partner involved. Therefore,\ngathering and sharing this TERRORISM INFORMATION will be done on a case-by-case, countryby-country basis.\nTERRORISM INFORMATION\nENCOUNTER.\n\n5.8\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation/Law Enforcement\nbe subdivided into three categories:\n\nENCOUNTERS.\n\nThese\n\nENCOUNTERS\n\ncan\n\n5.8.1 Name-Based Queries. Name-based transaction queries by law enforcement personnel\n(e.g., traffic stops) made to the FBI's National Crime Information Center at the Criminal\nJustice Information Services (CJIS) Division that match a name in the KSTF (a sub-file\nof NCIC) are deemed to be POTENTIAL MATCHES. They are routed electronically to TSC\nfor confirmation and subsequent processing as an ENCOUNTER.\n5.8.2 Fingerprint-Based Queries. Fingerprint-based queries submitted for criminal\nidentification purposes (e.g., an arrest/booking) or for civil identification purposes (e.g.,\nan employment background check) are made to the Integrated Automatic Fingerprint\nIdentification System (IAFIS). For POSITIVE MATCHES to records flagged as KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST records, the CJIS Division's Special Identities Unit notifies the\nTSC and the FBI case agent (or the Agency that identified the subject as a possible\nTERRORIST). In similar fashion, CJIS Division's Global Initiatives Unit coordinates\npositive fingerprint hits from its foreign submissions with the Legal Attaché. It should\nbe noted that IAFIS and NCIC are separate systems that are not fully synchronized at the\npresent time.\n5.8.3 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. All background checks\nresulting from attempts to buy firearms or to obtain explosive permits submitted to the\nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) at CJIS are run against the\nKSTF. The TSC is immediately notified of all KSTF \"hits.\" NICS consults with TSC\nto confirm the POSITIVE MATCHES and the FBI case agent to determine whether there is\navailable information about the prospective purchaser to disqualify him or her from\npossessing a firearm or explosive as a matter of law. Regardless of whether the\npurchase is denied or permitted to proceed, all available information is obtained and\nprovided to the TSC and, in turn, CTD, as TERRORISM INFORMATION and processed as an\nENCOUNTER.\n\n5.9\n\nDepartment of Defense E N C O U N T E R S . The Department of Defense (DoD) has force\nprotection, operational capture/apprehend, and intelligence responsibilities and on occasion\nencounters KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. To the extent DoD knowingly encounters a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, DoD will report the ENCOUNTER in intelligence channels or\nto the FBI in cases described in the MOU between the FBI and DoD Governing Information\nSharing, Operational Coordination and Investigative Responsibilities signed August 2, 2011\nwhere the FBI is the lead. In cases where the FBI is not the lead for the ENCOUNTER, the\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 64\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA) will be responsible for providing extracted information\nfrom the ENCOUNTER to NCTC via standard DIA national TERRORIST watchlisting procedures,\nwhich utilize community accepted standards. DoD law enforcement ENCOUNTERS will be\nhandled in accordance with established law enforcement standards that provide notification to\nthe FBI.\n5.10 All other Departments or Agencies.

This section outlines the processes for handling and\nsharing ENCOUNTER PACKAGES by SCREENERS, the TSC and NCTC.\n5.13 FBI/Law Enforcement E N C O U N T E R S . TSOU coordinates the U.S. Government's response to\nan ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. All collection of TERRORISM\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 69\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nINFORMATION during law enforcement ENCOUNTERS (e.g., traffic violations, investigations,\narrests) are coordinated between the NOMINATING AGENCY and the ENCOUNTERING AGENCY via\nTSOU.\n\n5.13.1 For domestic and international ENCOUNTERS with a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH\nto a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, TSOU will do the following: After receiving\nnotification of an ENCOUNTER from the TSC, TSOU will disseminate and coordinate\ninformation to FBI operational entities and federal, state, and local law enforcement\nAgencies. TSOU simultaneously coordinates with the appropriate FBI Field Division(s)\nand Case Agent(s); Joint Terrorist Task Forces (JTTFs); Airport Liaison Agents and\nAttaches (ALAs); ;LegaI Attachés (LEGATs); U.S. Embassies and/or other appropriate\nlaw enforcement officials, including ICE and CBP (specifically, NTC-P and NTC-C as\nappropriate); and appropriate members of the IC. For outbound ENCOUNTERS, or\nENCOUNTERS involving subjects who have certain DEROGATORY INFORMATION, TSOU\ncontacts (via phone and electronic notification) the appropriate counterterrorism\nelement(s). Especially sensitive ENCOUNTERS often require coordination and situational\nupdates with the White House, Northern Command (NORTHCOM), and FBI's\nCounterterrorism-Watch.\n5.14 TSC Actions. TSC will update existing KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST records with new\nTERRORIST IDENTIFIERS and TERRORISM INFORMATION and will provide the broader\ncounterterrorism analytic community with as much new information as possible stemming\nfrom an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. TSC's primary methods for\nsharing TERRORISM INFORMATION with the broader counterterrorism analytic community will\nbe through its EMA application and the use of Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs), as\ndescribed further in Section V, infra. TSC will also coordinate with Fusion Centers on law\nenforcement and other ENCOUNTERS impacting their Area of Responsibility. This\ncoordination will include a request for record enhancing information from the Fusion Center,\nwhich if received, will be added to the subject's KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST record.\n5.14.1 Any new TERRORISM INFORMATION recorded in, or attached to an EMA record by\nTSC will be provided to NCTC via an automated ingest process.89 Such daily ingests of\nEMA records update NCTC's TIDE to reflect the fact of the ENCOUNTER, any new\nidentifiers used to confirm the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST POSITIVE MATCHES, or\nthose identified in an IIR. Once TIDE has been updated, an automated ingest from\nTIDE to TSDB is used to update the various TSDB subsets (e.g., No Fly or Selectee\nLists). At this point, the process is complete and the watchlisting, screening and law\n8y\n\nAn \"automated ingest\" is one where the contents of T S C ' s E M A records are incorporated into N C T C ' s FIDE\ndatabase via a system-to-system transfer of information that identifies new or changed information. This process allows\nN C T C to spot KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST records that have been amended or updated. This process also\naccommodates the transfer of attached ENCOUNTER PACKAGES received from SCRF.F.NF.RS. In those instances, the\nENCOUN TER PACKAGES appear as attachments to the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST record. ENCOUNTER PACKAGE\nattachments must be moved to another system in order to give the broader counterterrorism community access to the\nTERRORISM INFORMATION. That process is described in Section V, infra.\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 70\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nenforcement communities have the most current and thorough TERRORISM INFORMA TION\navailable about a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. Most—but not all—of that\nTERRORISM INFORMATION is available in a structured format as part of the KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST record (e.g., discrete elements such as a date of birth, country of\norigin). The unstructured TERRORISM INFORMATION, while also in digitized format (e.g.,\na computer disk, a scanned image of a business card, an encountering officer's report), is\nhandled by NCTC.\n5.15 NCTC Actions. NCTC will post to TIDE Online any digitized ENCOUNTER PACKAGE it\nreceives from TSC or directly from a SCREENER. ENCOUNTER PACKAGES can be found under\nthe subject's main page.\n\nV.\n\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR UPDATING EXISTING KNOWN\nOR SUSPECTED TERRORIST RECORDS AND NOMINATING NEW\nKNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS BASED ON INFORMATION\nFROM POSITIVE ENCOUNTERS\n5.16 This section describes the roles and responsibilities of the watchlisting, screening, and\ncounterterrorism communities for exploitation and analysis of the TERRORISM INFORMATION\nlawfully collected and shared when there is a POSI TIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST. In this context the following definitions apply:\n5.16.1 \" I N I T I A L R E V I E W \" means a quick review of the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE to identify\nobvious, new TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS about the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.\n5.16.2 \" A D V A N C E D A N A L Y S I S \" means a thorough review of the TERRORISM INFORMATION\ncontained in an ENCOUNTER PACKAGE obtained as a result of the ENCOUNTER with the\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. ADVANCED ANALYSIS includes the adding of\nTERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to existing KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST records and\nidentifying new KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who should be nominated through\nthe existing nomination process. In this context, ADVANCED ANALYSIS is being done on\na tactical matter related to the specific KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST to identify\ninformation useful in \"connecting the dots\" between and among that KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST and other KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS or potential KNOWN\nor SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. It is also when the need for foreign language translation\nservices will be identified.\n5.16.3\n\nmeans further exploitation of a targeted set of ENCOUNTER\nand ADVANCED ANALYSIS products to assist in identifying TERRORIST trends\nand changes to methods, tactics, and practices. ENCOUNTERS for TARGETED ANALYSIS\nare selected using contemporaneous threat criteria and research in additional\nrepositories. Contemporaneous threat criteria includes association with a priority\nterrorist group (e.g., NIPF Tier I or II); ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED\n\" T A R G E T E D ANALYSIS\"\n\nPACKAGES\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 71\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\ndesignated as No Fly or associated with violent activity; or at the request of\nany Department or Agency that identifies a need.\n\nTERRORISTS\n\n5.17 Results of INITIAL REVIEW, ADVANCED ANALYSIS, and TARGETED ANALYSIS efforts\n(collectively, \"Exploitation\") by Departments or Agencies will be reported to the watchlisting,\nscreening and counterterrorism communities using standard templates when available.\n5.17.1\n\nTSC Actions.\n\n5.17.1.1\n\nFirst Stage Review. TSC actions with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST\noccur in two stages. The first stage occurs when the ENCOUNTERING\nAGENCY and TSC exchange TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS to determine whether the\nindividual is watchlisted (i.e., a POSITIVE MATCH to a TSDB record). TSC records\nany new TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS provided during this stage in TSC's EMA\napplication.\nENCOUNTERS\n\n5.17.1.2 Second Stage Review. The second stage occurs after TSC has confirmed\nthere is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. For each\nPOSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST, the TSC's Office of\nIntelligence (TSC/Ol) will generate an IIR for dissemination to the\ncounterterrorism community that provides a summary about the KNOWN or\nSUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCOUNTER (e.g., basic facts about the ENCOUNTER such as\ndate, time, and place). If available at the time the initial IIR is prepared, TSC/OI\nwill conduct an INITIAL REVIEW of the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE and provide a\nthumbnail summary of the TERRORISM INFORMATION. For example, a summary\nmight highlight the existence of a new KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST (\"KNOWN\nor SUSPECTED TERRORIST was traveling with three other associates not previously\nidentified in the car where the explosives were found in a hidden compartment\") or\nthe possibility that new TERRORIST IDENTIFIERS are available (\"approximately 80\npages carried by the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST were converted to electronic\ndocuments ranging from the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST'S calendar/address\nbook to bank account and credit card numbers\").\n5.17.2\n\nNational Media Exploitation Center Actions. Much of the TERRORISM\ngenerated by ENCOUNTERS from a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a\nKNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is expected to be in a foreign language that may hinder\nprompt exploitation. The National Media Exploitation Center (NMEC) has the\ncapability to translate foreign language information and the experience necessary to\nunderstand the efforts used to hide their activities. When TSC receives ENCOUNTER\nPACKAGES with information in a foreign language, or when NCTC receives them\ndirectly from an ENCOUNTERING AGENCY, TSC or NCTC will forward/notify NMEC that\nit has the action to translate the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE. Once the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE\nhas been translated and returned to TSC and NCTC, the assigned roles and responsibility\nfor exploitation will apply.\nINFORMATION\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 72\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n5.17.3\n\nFBI Actions. The majority of the FBI's ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED\noccur in the United States. The FBI has ADVANCED ANALYSIS responsibility\nfor ENCOUNTER PACKAGES on KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS for whom the FBI has\nan open investigation, no matter where the individual is encountered. If the FBI does\nnot have an open investigation on a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST encountered in the\nUnited States, or if the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is a U.S. PERSON, then TSOU\nwill send a lead directing the appropriate FBI field office to conduct an assessment of\nthe individual and the ENCOUNTER circumstances to determine whether to open a\n\nTERRORISTS\n\nQO\n\n•\n\npreliminary or full investigation. This assessment includes ADVANCED ANALYSIS\npackages when provided by ENCOUNTERING AGENCIES. If no investigation is opened, an\nIIR will be sent to the NOMINATING AGENCY and NCTC which will be used to enhance\nthe TIDE record with additional FBI-derived information.\n5.17.4\n\nDHS l&A Actions. DHS I&A has ADVANCED ANALYSIS responsibility for\nENCOUNTER PACKAGES where the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST is denied entry,\ndenied ESTA, denied boarding, or is subject to a no board recommendation at a foreign\nlocation, or identified through ICE's visa security processes.\n\n5.17.5\n\nNCTC Actions. On occasion, DOS, USAID, and foreign governments have\nwith KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, usually in the form of a record\nENCOUNTER (e.g., the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST has submitted an application for\na benefit like a visa or grant or information is provided to the United States by a foreign\ngovernment). NCTC has ADVANCED ANALYSIS responsibility for ENCOUNTER PACKAGES\nin these instances.\nENCOUNTERS\n\n5.17.5.1\n\nFor TARGETED ANALYSIS, NCTC offers this capability for a select set of\nbased on internal or interagency tasking. Since all\nADVANCED ANALYSIS products created by FBI, DHS, or NCTC will be\ndisseminated to the U.S. Government via an IIR, these materials are available to\nany organization seeking to further exploit specific ENCOUNTERS. NCTC will\nleverage these ADVANCED ANALYSIS products as part of its typical intelligence\nanalytic process to highlight emerging threats, issues or concerns.\nENCOUNTER PACKAGES\n\n5.17.6 A chart depicting the roles and responsibilities by Department or Agency may be\nfound at the end of this Chapter.\n\nVI.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY TO COORDINATE ANY ACTIONS\nCONTEMPLATED BASED ON INFORMATION FROM ENCOUNTERS\nWITH A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORIST\n90\n\nUnder governing authorities, the EBI can conduct \"assessments\" for an authorized purpose, such as obtaining\ninformation about a threat to national security, without a particular factual predication. T o open an investigation whether a \"preliminary\" or \" f u l l \" investigation - there must be a specific factual predication.\n\nUN CLASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nPage | 73\n\n\fUNCL ASSI FI ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\n\n5.18 Information Sharing MOU Requirements. Departments and Agencies are reminded of\ntheir agreement to provide transparency between and among them with regard to their\n\"activities to preempt, prevent, and disrupt TERRORIST attacks against U.S. PERSONS and\ninterests.91\" As a practical matter, that type of transparency demands, to the greatest extent\npossible, prior coordination with affected Departments or Agencies before action within a\nDepartment or Agency's authorities is taken based on TERRORISM INFORMATION from a person\nwho is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. For example, FBI, Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA) or DOD, as lead counterterrorism Agencies in their respective\ndomains, must be consulted prior to taking any action based on ENCOUNTERS with a person\nwho is a POSITIVE MATCH with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST. This guidance is subject to\nexisting policies and coordination procedures when action against or pertaining to the KNOWN\nor SUSPECTED TERRORIST is contemplated.\n5.19 Requests for Withholding of Action. In certain circumstances, law enforcement or the 1C\nmay request that a SCREENER not take action (e.g., not to refuse the visa, to allow individual to\nenter the United States, to not deny an individual to obtain an immigration benefit or access to\nthe secure area of an airport) although action may be taken under the law. This request, to the\nextent practicable, shall be in writing, by a senior official, and include a statement of\njustification and risk mitigation. Departments and Agencies will establish mutually\nacceptable processes and procedures to implement a detailed plan.\n\nVII.\n\nEXAMPLES OF TERRORISM INFORMATION TYPICALLY\nAVAILABLE FROM ENCOUNTERS\n5.20 The following examples of various types of ENCOUNTERS and the type of information typically\ngenerated from those ENCOUNTERS is offered to assist Departments and Agencies in\nunderstanding what additional or new information may become available as a result of\nfollowing the guidance provided in this document.\n5.20.1\n\nPorts of Entry. Types of documents that could be included in the\nPACKAGE typically include:\n1. Business cards\n2.

Likewise, the parties agree that, to the greatest extent\npossible, there should be transparency between and a m o n g the covered entities with regard to their activities to preempt,\nprevent, and disrupt TERRORIST attacks against U.S. PERSONS and interests. Except as otherwise specified in this\nAgreement, or mandated by relevant Federal statutes or Presidential Directives, procedures and mechanisms for\ninformation sharing, use, and handling shall be interpreted and implemented consistently and reciprocally regardless of\nthe role a particular covered entity plays as a provider or recipient of covered information.

All procedures,\nguidelines, and mechanisms under this Agreement shall be designed and implemented,\nand all determinations with regard to sharing information covered by this Agreement shall\nbe made, with the understood, overriding priority of preventing, preempting, and\ndisrupting terrorist threats to our homeland. The parties recognize and agree that, in some\ncases, this priority shall dictate information sharing even where doing so may affect,\ncriminal prosecutions or ongoing law enforcement or intelligence operations.\nNonetheless, the covercd entities shall act under this Agreement in a manner to protect, to\nthe greatest extent possible, these other significant interests, including the protection of\nintelligence and sensitive law enforcement sources and methods, other classified\ninformation, and sensitive operational and prosecutorial information.\n(b)\nReciprocity and Transparency.

Except as\notherwise specified in this Agreement, or mandated by relevant Federal statutes or\nPresidential Directives, procedures and mechanisms for information sharing, use, and\nhandling shall be interpreted and implemented consistently and reciprocally regardless of\nthe role a particular covered entity plays as a provider or recipient of covered information.\nIn other words, for example, international terrorism information collected by the Border\nPatrol should be shared by DHS with the IC to the same extent foreign intelligence\ninformation on terrorism is shared by the IC with DHS.\n\n\f(c)\nScope of \"Covered Information. \" Consistent with the priority established\nin Section 3(a), information relating to terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction,\nvulnerabilities, or other functions of the Department of Homeland Security shall be\npresumed to be \"covered information\" under this Agreement. If, after applying this\npresumption, disagreement remains between covered entities about whether particular\ninformation is \"covered information,\" such disagreement shall beresolvedpursuant to\nSection 4(d).\n(d)\nEffective date of information sharing obligations. Notwithstanding\nprovisions of this Agreement mandating further agreement on mechanisms, procedures,\nor other issues, the parties recognize that the obligation to promptly begin the full range\nof information sharing mandated by the DHS Legislation came into force on January 24,\n2003, and that obligations under this Agreement will be in force upon the signature of all\nparties.\n(e)\nSharing Requirements Based on Substance Only. Consistent with the\nDHS Legislation and other relevant statutory authorities, Presidential Directives, the\nPresident's announced policies for protecting against terrorist threats to the homeland,\nand this Agreement, the parties agree that this Agreement requires that covered\ninformation, including, but not limited to, tenorism information, WMD information,\ninfrastructure, and vulnerabilities information, be provided by any covered entity that\ncollects or analyzes that information to any other covered entity that has a necd-to-know\nthat information (or information relating to that subject matter), based on a broad\ninterpretation of the mission of the other covered entity, regardless of:\n(i) The type of communication in which the information is incorporated.\nCovered information must be provided as required in this Agreement regardless of\nthe type of communication in which it is originally reported by the providing\nagency. The fact that particular covered information may be contained originally\nin a particular type of communication shall not, under any circumstances, be\ngrounds either to withhold or delay the sharing of any covered information. As\nillustrative examples only, covered information must be provided by CIA, within\nthe time frames agreed to, whether such information is contained originally in\ncommunications referred to as \"TDs,\" \"intel cables,\" \"ops cables,\" or any other\ntype of communication. Likewise, covered information must be provided by the\nFBI, within the time frames agreed to, whether such information is contained\noriginally in communications referred to as \"302s,\" \"ECs,\" \"LHMs,\" or any other\ntype of communication;\n•\n\n(ii) The manner in which the information is or may be conveyed to the\nintended agency or individual recipients. Covered entities shall continually\nendeavor to improve technological means of access to afford maximum\nflexibility, speed, and volume of information shared, consistent with the strictly\nnecessary protection of intelligence or sensitive law enforcement sources and\nmethods, and with section 3(a) and other relevant provisions of this Agreement.\n\n\f(f)\nTerrorist Threat Integration Center. The parties agree that, when fully\noperational, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TT1C) shall be the preferred, though\nnot the exclusive, method for sharing covcred.information at the national level. TTIC\ninformation-sharing mechanisms and procedures shall be consistent with the DHS\nLegislation and other relevant statutory authorities, Presidential Directives, the\nPresident's announced policies for protecting against terrorist threats to the homeland,\nand this Agreement. As soon as practicable, the parties shall determine the extent to\nwhich provision of information to one or more covered entities via the TTIC may\nconstitute the only required method for providing such information to such entities,\nprovided however, that any.decision to share covered information among the parties\nsolely by means of the TTIC shall be memorialized in a separate written agreement\nexecuted by the parties, including by designees of the officials signing this Agreement.\nAnalytic conclusions contained in TTIC products shall not be altered by agencies prior to\ndissemination.\n(g)\nPolicies for Sharing Particular Types ofInformation With DHS.\nConsistent with the DHS Legislation and other relevant statutory authorities, Presidential\nDirectives, the President's announced policies for protecting against terrorist threats to\nthe homeland, and this Agreement, the Secretary shall be provided access to all\ninformation necessary for him to carry out the mission of the Department. Except as\notherwise directed by the President, the parties agree that the amount of information and\ndepth of detail of information provided to the Secretary, which will vary by the type of\ninformation at issue, will be governed by the following policies:\n(i)\nInformation Related to Threats of Terrorism Against the United\nStates. As required by the DHS Legislation, DHS shall be provided, without\nrequest, all \"reports (including information reports containing intelligence which\nhas not been fully evaluated), assessments, and analytical information.\" The\nparties understand that, in this category, cxcept upon further request by DHS, and\nagreement by the originating entity, provided information will not routinely\ninclude information, collected through intelligence sources or methods, or\nsensitive law enforcement sources or methods, which has not been processed in\nany way to reduce the amount of substantive content or synthesize the material.\nThus, for example, a recording of a conversation intercepted under the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act (F1SA) or an intelligence officer's or FBI agent's\nhand-written notes of a discussion with a source would not be routinely provided\nin Uiis category. By contrast, a report forwarding the substance of a FISArecorded conversation, or an FBI \"Electronic Communication\" (EC), including the\nsubstance of a discussion with a source, even if these include verbatim quotes\nfrom the underlying notes, would be provided. ECs containing substantive\ninformation, along with \"302s,\" \"TDs,\" \"lIRs,\" and all other similar documents\nincluding substantive information, fall into the category of information to be\nprovided. The parties agree, as soon as practicable, to identity and/or put into\nplace necessary and reasonable mechanisms, including, when operational, the\nTTIC, along with the Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs), and procedures, to\nensure that DHS receives all such information automatically, under the policies\n\n\fand procedures agreed to in this Agreement, without further request.\nJ\n\n(ii)\nVulnerabilities Information. As required by the DHS Legislation,\nDHS shall be provided, without request, all information of any kind concerning\n\"the vulnerability of the infrastructure of the United States, or other vulnerabilities\nof the United States, to terrorism, whether or not such information has been\nanalyzed.\" The parties understand that, in this category, without further request\nby DHS, provided information will routinely include information, collected\nthrough intelligence sources or methods, or sensitive law enforcement sources or\nmethods, which has not been processed in any way to reduce the amount of\nsubstantive content or synthesize the material. Provided information will include\nall types of information, without regard to the distinctions drawn by way of. .\nexample in Section 3(gXi), except as further agreed to by the parties or their\ndesignees. The parties agree, as soon as practicable, to identify and/or put into\nplace necessary and reasonable mechanisms, including, when operational, the\nTTIC, along with the JTTFs, and procedures, to ensure that DHS receives all such\ninformation, under the principles agreed to in this Agreement, without further\nrequest.\n(iii)\nInformation Relating to Significant and Credible Threats of\nTerrorism. As required by the DHS Legislation, DHS shall be provided, without\nrequest, all information of any kind concerning \"significant and credible threats of\nterrorism against the United States, whether or not such information has been\nanalyzed.\" The parties understand that, in this category, without further request\nby DHS, provided information will routinely include information, collected\nthrough intelligence sources or methods, or sensitive law enforcement sources or\nmethods, which has not been processed in any way to reduce the amount of\nsubstantive content or synthesize the material. Provided information will include\nall types of information, without regard to the distinctions drawn by way of\nexample in Section 3(gXi), except as further agreed to by the parties or their\ndesignees. The parties agree, as soon as practicable, to identify and/or put into\nplace neccssary and reasonable mechanisms, including, when operational, the\nTTIC, along with the JTTFs, and procedures, to ensure that DHS receives all such\ninformation, under the principles agreed to in this Agreement, without further\nrequest.\n(iv) Other Information Requested hy the Secretary. The Secretary shall\nbe provided, upon request, with such other information relating to threats of\nterrorism against the United States or to other areas of DHS' responsibility,\nwhether or not such information has been analyzed. The parties understand that\nDHS will be provided information in this category upon request including, if so\nrequested, information which has not been processed in any way to reduce the\namount of substantive content or synthesize the material. If so requested,\nprovided infonnation will include all types of information, without regard to the\ndistinctions drawn by way of example in Section 3(g)(i), except as otherwise\ndirected by the President. The parties agree, as soon as practicable, to set up\n\n\fnecessary and reasonable mechanisms, including, when operational, theTTlC,\nalong with the JTTFs, and procedures, to ensure that DHS, when requested,\nreceives all such information, under the principles agreed to in this Agreement..\n(h)\nTimely Sharing of Information. Covered information must be provided to\nthose with a need-to-know that information (or information relating to that subject\nmatter), based on a broad interpretation of the mission of the other covered entity, as\nquickly as possible. Providing all timely and relevant covered information to those who\nhave a need-to-know it in order to assist them in meeting their homeland security-related\nresponsibilities is fundamental to the succcss of the Department and all other efforts to\nensure the security of the homeland from terrorist attack. Delay in providing s.uch\ninformation risks frustrating efforts to meet these critical responsibilities and could result\nin preventable attacks against U.S. persons or interests failing to be preempted, prevented,\nor disrupted. Accordingly, except as otherwise directed by the President or agreed to by\nall parties, the parties agree that:\n(i)\nInformation that a covered entity reasonably believes relates to a\npotential terrorism or WMD threat, to the United States homeland, its\ninfrastructure, or to United States persons or interests, shall be provided\nimmediately to other covercd entities;\n(ii)\nOther covered information, including, but not limited to,\nvulnerabilities information, but which a covered entity does not reasonably\nbelieve relates to a potential terrorism or WMD threat to the United States\nhomeland, its infrastructure, or to United States persons or interests, shall be\nprovided as expeditiously as possible;\n(iii)\nUnder no circumstances may covered information be withheld\nfrom a covered entity with a need-to-know that information (or information\nrelating to that subject matter), based on a broad interpretation of the mission of\nthe other covercd entity, or may the sharing of such information be delayed\nbeyond the timeframesagreed to in this Agreement, except as consistent with the\nSection 4(d), or other relevant provisions of this Agreement;\n(iv)\nWhen a question arises as to whether covered information must be\nprovided to the Department or any other covered entity pursuant to this;\nAgreement, the parties will resolve the question pursuant to Section 4(d);\n(v)\nCovered entities agree to use, to the greatest extent possible, the\nmost rapid methods of information sharing, consistent with the strictly necessary\nprotection of intelligence or sensitive law enforcement sources and methods, and\nwith Section 3(a) and other relevant provisions of this Agreement; and\n(vi) Consistent with Section 3, and other relevant provisions of this\nAgreement, the parties agree that they shall work diligently to ensure that all\ncovered entities receive the same information within the same time frame.\n\n\fAgreement, to withhold in its entirety a communication containing covered\ninformation, such indication shall occur immediately.\n(v)\nThe parties agree that the provisions of this section shall-not apply\nto established source protection procedures utilized by CIA's Directorate of\nOperations, or equivalent procedures developed and used by other covered\nentities, provided that such procedures do not result in the failure to provide DHS\nwith substantive information as required under the DHS Legislation and this\nAgreement, and that the Secretary may personally request revisions in such\nprocedures if he detennines that they restrict DHS' access to information in a way\nthat jeopardizes DHS' mission. For information described in Section 3{iX'0. such\nprocedures shall be revised, as soon as is practicable, and without request from the\nSecretary, to ensure that those procedures'only remove such intelligence that\nclearly identifies, or would reasonably permit ready identification of, intelligence\nor sensitive law enforcement sources or methods that are particularly susceptible\nto countermeasures that would nullify or measurably rcduce their effectiveness.\n(j)\nRequests for Additional Information. In addition to the participation of\nDHS in the \"requirements\" processes, as discussed further herein, the DHS Legislation\nprovides for DHS to request additional or follow-up information upon receipt of\nindividual items of information. As soon as practicable, the parties shall agree.to\nmechanisms and procedures, including the TTIC, JTTFs, and, if appropriate, focal points,\nfor DHS to make, and covered entities to respond to, such requests. These mechanisms\nand procedures shall be designed to facilitate the greatest amount of additional\ninformation sharing consistent with strictly necessary protection of intelligence^\nsensitive law enforcement sources and methods, with Section 3(a) and other relevant\nprovisions of this Agreement, and with the timeliest possible responses to requests for\nadditional information.\n(k)\nInformation Use Restrictions. In general, parties shall disclose covered\ninformation free of any originator controls or information use restrictions. Several\ncategories of covered information that must be disclosed to covered entities pursuant to\nthe DHS Legislation, this Agreement, and other authorities, remain subject to special\nlabeling, handling, storage, use and access auditing requirements imposed by statute or, to\nthe extent consistent with the DHS Legislation, Presidential Directives, the President's\nannounced policies for protecting against terrorist threats lo the homeland, and this\nAgreement, pursuant to applicable regulations. The scope and duration of such\nrestrictions, including caveats restricting use of the disclosed information to a particular\nlevel or element of a covered entity, will be tailored to address the particular situation or\nsubjcct matter involved. When imposed, use restrictions shall be no more restrictive than\nstrictly necessary to accomplish the desired effect.\n(I)\nSecondary Information Sharing. To the extent consistent with this\nAgreement, covered entities may share information provided by other covered entities\nwith additional covcred entities. Such secondary sharing shall be carried out, to the\ngreatest extent possible, in a manner that permits the originating agcncy to know to\n\n\fwhom the information has been provided. The parties shall agree, as soon as is\npracticable, upon recommendations, if any, for changes to Executive Order 12958,\nDirector of Centrai Intelligence Directive 6/6 (and complementary or successor directives\ndealing with Originator Controls, the so-called \"third agency rule,\" and other policies or\nprocedures governing the sharing of received information with additional recipients) in\norder to comply with the DHS Legislation, and to carry out the President's announced\npolicies for protecting against terrorist threats to the homeland, and the provisions of this\nAgreement.\n(m)\nOther Obligations to Share Information. A covered entity's voluntary or\nobligatory provision of covered information to another covcrcd entity does not in itself\ndischarge or diminish any other obligation the providing entity may have to provide that\ninformation, or any part of it, to any other department, agency or other public or private\norganization or individual under any statute, Presidential Directive, or other agreement.\nAlthough all covered entities will attempt to identify and call attention to information\nrelevant to the mission of other covered entities, the responsibility to share information\nrelevant to the mission or responsibilities of any covered entity in addition to DHS\nremains the responsibility of the originator or initial federal recipient of the information\nand does not shift to DHS by virtue of DHS' receipt of the information. The parties\nagree, however, that, to the greatest extent possible, other sharing obligations shall be\nharmonized and coordinated with those covered by this Agreement, including the agreed\npreference for using the TTIC and JTFFs as information-sharing mechanisms, in order to\nreduce duplication, facilitate dcconfliction, and increase efficiency.\n(n)\nPATRIOT Act Information. Law enforcement-related information related\nto DHS mission, permitted or required to be provided to intelligence agencies under the\nPATRIOT Act and its implementing guidelines shall also be considered covered\ninformation under this Agreement and shall, therefore, be provided to the Department and\nother covered entities, in accordance with the DHS Legislation and other relevant\nstatutory provisions, and this Agreement.\n(o)\nOther Intelligence Information. Nothing in this Agreement shall be read\nto restrict the access of the Secretary or his designee to information the Secretary\nordinarily would receive as a member of the Intelligence Community, including national\nsecurity and foreign intelligence information.\n(p)\nInformation Sharing Mechanisms. As soon as practicable, the parties shall\nagree upon specific mechanisms, consistent with Section 3 and other relevant provisions\nof this Agreement, for how different types of covered information will be shared,\nincluding technical and administrative arrangements, and, as appropriate, designation of\nfocal points, to maximize the effectiveness and coordination for providing covered\ninformation. Subsequent arrangements for information sharing may he reached upon the\napproval of the parties or their designees. The parties shall work to develop, as part of\nthis process, effective mcchanisms for covered entities to identify covered information\nheld by them and to ensure, to the greatest degree feasible, the provision of such\ninformation, without specific request, to other covered entities. The parties further agree\n\n\n\fthat, notwithstanding their agreement to develop further mechanisms and procedures ÎOT\ninformation sharing, covered entities shall promptly build on mechanisms and procedures\nalready in place to identify and provide to DHS covered information that is generated or\nreceived by them in the course of carrying out their missions.\n(q)\nMethods ojProviding Information. The parties rccognize and agree that\nthere arc many possible methods for \"providing\" information, including, but not limited\nto, hand-delivery, oral briefings, transmission by secure data-link, and affordtng routine\nand unrestricted access to computerized databases, including the ability to transfer such\ninformation to a recipient entity as ncccssary, and by full and complete co-location of\nanalysts or other personnel and full integration of, and acccss to, information, as well as.\nfor example, ensuring that the Secretary receives all daily threat briefing materials\n(including threat matrices and overnight reports). The parties further agree that\nrequirements to \"provide\" information under this Agreement may be satisfied, depending\non the type of information at issue, by the use of a single mechanism, such as via the\nTTIC, consistent with section 3(f) of this Agreement, or a combination of mechanisms\nalready in place and/or created under this Agreement. The parties shall agree, as pan of\nthe development of these mcchanisms and procedures, as to which method, or\ncombination of methods, of providing information will be sufficient for particular types\nor categories of information.\n(r)\nResponsible Officials for Information Sharing. Until such lime as\nmodified by the parties, the responsible officials tor information sharing under this\nAgreement are as follows:\n(i)\nFor the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Undersecretary for\nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, or another individual\ndesignated by the Secretary to act in this capacity;\n(ii)\nFor the Attorney General, Executive Assistant Director for\nCounterterrorism and Counterintelligence; and\n(iii)\nFor the Director of Central Intelligence, the Associate Director of\nCentral Intelligence for Homeland Security.\n(s)\nProvision of Covered Information to the DHS Directorate of Information\nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection Until further agreement by the parties, or their\ndesignees, all covcrcd information provided, including information provided, under\ncurrent procedures, to existing elements transferred lo DHS, e.g., the United States Coast\nGuard and the U.S. Customs Service, shall also be separately provided to the Directorate\nof Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, including, if agreed by the\nSecretary, via the TTIC. The Undersecretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure\nProtection, or another individual designated hy the Sccrctary to act in this capacity, shall\nwork with entities not within the Directorate to ensure effective coordination of\ninformation.\n\n\f(t)\nClassified Information. The head of each covered entity shall put\nprocedures in place to ensure that each individual recipient of classified information has,\nand maintains, appropriate security clearances, training, and need-to-know to receive\nclassified information at the level at which the recipient will receive such information,\nindividuals shall be designated at each covered entity at several levels of seniority to\nreceive classified information judged by the originating agency to be sufficiently\nsensitive to require limited distribution. In rare cases, the parties expect that extremely\nsensitive information may be provided only to the Secretary or, as appropriate, the head\nof another covered entity. The head of each covered entity also shall ensure that all\nmechanisms and procedures for receiving, storing, and handling classified information\nmeet established legal and regulatory standards. The policies and procedures governing\naccess to covered information under this Agreement, including such information that is\nclassified, shall apply without regard to whether that information is made available in\nwritten, oral, or electronic form, or to the means or mechanism by which it is\ncommunicated to the recipient.\n(u)\nThresholds. In order to ensure that the Department is provided with all\ninformation necessary to carry out its responsibilities, but is not inundated with\nunmanageable volumes of information below thresholds reasonable to perform its\nmission, as soon as practicable, the Secretary shall advise the other parties, individually\nor collectively, as to establishing additional thresholds for information sharing, consistent\nwith the DHS Legislation. For example, the Secretary may determine that low-level\ninformation concerning purely indigenous foreign terrorist groups with no apparent\ncapability to mount operations against the United States is not relevant to DHS' mission.\nSuch further agreement shall be consistent with the DHS Legislation and other relevant\nstatutory authorities, Presidential Directives, the President's announced policies for\nprotecting against terrorist threats to the homeland, and this Agreement. At any time\nfollowing such initial agreement, the parties may agree to additional information sharing,\nor to more or less restrictive thresholds, as the volume of information involved and the\nneeds of DHS become clearer, so long as such agreements are consistent with the DHS\nlegislation and this Agreement. Such agreements may be made by designees of the\nparties.\n(v)\nPrivacy. All information sharing pursuant to this Agreement shall be\nconsistent with applicable privacy laws.\n4.\n\nCoordination. Dcconfliction. and Dispute Resolution.\n\n(a)\nCoordination and Deconjliciion Policy. Consistent with the President's\ndirection that our highest priority is the protection of the American people from\npotentially devastating terrorist attacks, covered entities shall take all necessary measures\nto ensure that terrorist threats to our homeland are addressed cooperatively, efficiently,\nand with the understood overriding purpose of preventing, preempting, and disrupting\nthose threats. To that end, the parties agree that no homeland security-related prevention,\npreemption, or disruption activity of any covered entity shall be presumed to be the best\noption in any given case, or otherwise deemed of higher precedencc, importance, or\n\n\n\fpriority than any other such activity. The covered entities shall work together, io the\ngreatest extent possible, to achieve, in each case, the maximum preventative, preemptive,\nand disruptive effect on potential threats, including coordinating simultaneous and\ncomplementary activities of multiple covered entities when appropriate. Because the\nfailure to coordinate operational activities to preempt, prevent, and disrupt terrorist\nthreats can create confusion, inefficiency and, in extreme cases, dangerous situations\nresulting horn conflicting operational activities, the parties agree to coordinate,\noperational activities to the greatest possible extent. Specifically, each party shall take all\nreasonable steps to ensure coordination and deconfliction of homeland security-related\nlaw enforcement, intelligence or national sccurity-related activities of covered entities\nunder that party's authority with such activities of other covcred entities.\n(b)\nAnalytic Conclusions and Supporting Information. Terrorism and other\nhomeland-security related analytic efforts of all covered entities must be informed by the\nmost comprehensive, accurate, and timely information available, regardless of its nature\nand source, including, but not limited to, terrorism, WMD, vulnerabilities, and other\npertinent information available to any covered entity. Analytic conclusions relating to\nterrorist or WMD threats to the homeland, or other issues within the responsibility of\nDHS, including information updating and amplifying previous conclusions, must be\nshared with all covered entities as soon as they arc produced. Preemptive, preventative,\nand disruptive actions by all covered entities must be informed to the greatest extent\npossible by all available information and by all analytic conclusions, including.competing\nconclusions, of all entities with relevant analytic responsibilities. At the same time, the\nFederal government must, to the greatest extent possible, speak with one voice to state\nand local officials, private industry, and the public, in order to prevent confusion, mixed\nsignals, and, potentially, dangerous operational conflicts. In furtherance of these goals,\nthe parties agree as follows:\n(i)\nThe parties shall ensure that covered entities disseminate their\nterrorism or other homeland security-related analytic products without delay to\nother covered entities that have related interests and responsibilities; .\n(ii)\nExcept as otherwise provided in Sections 4(bXiii) or (iv), no\nanalytic conclusions, as defined in Section 2(a) of this Agreement, of any covered\nentity shall be disseminated to state, local, or private sector officials, or to the\npublic, without the prior approval of the Secretary of Homeland Security, his\ndesignee, or in accordance with approval mechanisms, potentially including the\nTTIC or the JTTFs, established by the Secretary after the date of this Agreement.\n(iii) Analytic conclusions may be provided directly to such officials or\nto the public where die head of a covcred entity or his or her designee reasonably\ndetermines that exigent circumstances exist such that providing an analytic\nconclusion prior to required approval is necessary to prevent, preempt, or disrupt\nan imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury or significant damage to U.S.\ninfrastructure or other interests. In the event an analytic conclusion is\ndisseminated pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception in this paragraph,\nM\n\n\fthe Secretary and other covered entities shall be notified immediately of the\ndissemination.\n•\n(iv) Analytic conclusions may be shared with federal, state, and local\nlaw enforcement officials without the prior approval of the Secretary of\nHomeland Security, provided, however, that it is the intention of the parties that\nDHS be provided with the earliest possible advance notice of the potential of such\ncommunications and, where possible, DHS will be included in the development of\nthe communications through the DHS liaisons at FBI Headquarters. The\nSecretary of Homeland Security, or his designee (including a DHS representative\nto a JTTF if designated by the Secretary to do so), must approve further\ndissemination of such analytic conclusions to other non-law enforcement state and\nlocal officials or to the public.\n(v)\nNothing in this Agreement shall prevent covered entities from\ncoordinating on analytic conclusions with, or seeking the views of, other Federal\nGovernment entities in evaluating terrorism or other homeland-security-related\ninformation.\n(c)\nEstablishment ofMechanisms for Operational Coordination and\nDeconfliction. As soon as practicable, the parties shall agree upon specific mechanisms,\nincluding technical, administrative, and, as appropriate, designation of focal points, to\nmaximize the effectiveness of operational coordination and deconfliction. These will\ncover both overseas and domestic operations related to homeland security. Subsequent\nagreements for operational coordination and deconfliction may be reached upon the\napproval of the parties or their designees.\n(d)\nInformation Sharing Dispute Resolution. Consistent with the DHS\nLegislation and other relevant statutory authorities, Presidential Directives, the\nPresident's announced policies for protecting against terrorist tlveats to the homeland, the\nobligation to protect intelligence or sensitive law enforcement sources and methods firom\nunauthorized disclosure, and with Section 3(a), and other relevant sections of this\nAgreement, issues concerning the application of the terms of this Agreement in any\nspecific context with respect to whether particular covercd information should be\nprovided to the Department or to any other covered entity shall be handled under the\nfollowing procedures:\n(i)\nA holder of particular covered information at issue, whether within\nor outside the entity originating that information, shall refer the matter by the most\nexpeditious means to the head of the entity originating the information (or\nthat official's designee) for expeditious review.\n(ii)\nThe reviewing official shall, without exception, render a definitive\ndecision on the request within 24 hours of receiving the referral and, in light of\nthe access provisions in the DHS Legislation, shall resolve any doubt in favor of\n\n1}\n\n\fI\n\n>\n\n\"O\na\n\nproviding the requested information.\n\ng_\nx\n\n(iii) If the originating agency's reviewing official declines to provide\nthe covered information requested, that official shall, within the 24 hours allotted\nfor response, provide the Department or other covcred with —\n(A)\nthe fact that the specific information is being withheld;\n(B)\na succinct and specific statement of the reasons for the\nwithholding; and\n(C)\nas much of the information requested as the head of the\noriginating agency (or that official's designee) reasonably concludes can\nbe provided given the President's announced policies for protecting\nagainst terrorist threats to the homeland, the DHS Legislation and other\nrelevant statutory authorities, and relevant Presidential Directives.\n(iv)\nIf, at that point, a compromise is not reached expeditiously, the\ndispute will be resolved either by the Secretary, Attorney General, and DCI by\nmutual decision or through referral to the Assistant to the President for National\nSecurity Affairs and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Affairs, or\ntheir designees, for resolution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this\nAgreement, the Attorney General, Secretary, or DCI, or their deputies may,\nwhenever any of them deems it necessary or advisable (particularly when a\nfundamental matter of policy is implicated or time is of the essence), intervene to\nraise and resolve any issue of access to covered information by mutual decision or\nthrough the National Security Council and/or Homeland Security Council system.\n(e) NSPD-8. Nothing in this Agreement in any way affects the\nresponsibilities and authorities for coordination of United Slates counter-terrorism\nactivities established in National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 8.\n5.\nProtection of Intelligence and Sensitive Law Enforcement Sources and Methods.\nThe parties intend that all provisions of this Agreement be interpreted consistently with the DCl's\nstatutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure\nand with similar responsibilities of the Attorney General and the Secretary to protcct sensitive\nlaw enforcement sources and methods, with the DHS Legislation and other relevant statutory\nauthorities, Presidential Directives, the President's announced policies for protecting against\nterrorist threats to the homeland, and with Scction 3(a), and other relevant provisions of this\nAgreement. Consistent with this agreed-upon interpretation:\n(a)\nThe DCI shall carry out his responsibilities for the protection of\nintelligence sources and methods, and the Secretary and Attorney General shall carry oui\nanalogous responsibilities for sensitive law enforcement sources and methods, in a\nmanner, and through mechanisms, that ensure that all covered information is made\navailable promptly to the Department, and to other covcred entities with a need-to-know\nand proper security clearances and handling procedures in place, subject only to such\nhandling and use restrictions as arc strictly and unavoidably necessary to protect\n\n\fintelligence and sensitive law enforcement sources and methods from unauthorized\ndisclosure.\n(i)\nThe DC1 shall ensure that the substance of all covered information\nrelevant to the responsibilities of all covered entities is provided to those entities\nin a form suited to their effective use of that information, consistent with the\nDCI's obligation to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized\ndisclosure and Section 3(a) of this Agreement. The Secretary and the Attorney\nGeneral shall similarly ensure that the substance of covered information is\nprovided in a suitable form.\n(ii)\nThe DCI shall ensure that dissemination of classified reporting\nbased, wholly or in part, on covered information, is accompanied by dissemination\nof as much of that reporting and covered information as is possible at an\nunclassified (which may, when necessary, be marked \"Sensitive-but-Unclassified\"\nor \"SBU\") or reduced classification level, in order to ensure the broadest possible\navailability and use of covered information by those with a need-to-know that\ninformation (or information relating to that subject matter), based on a broad\ninterpretation of the mission of the other covered entity.; The Secretary and the\nAttorney General shall similarly ensure that dissemination is done in a manner\nthat ensures the broadest possible availability.\n(b)\nInformation may be redacted or put into a tailored product to the extent\nconsistent with Section 3(i) of this Agreement.\n(c)\nNothing in this section relieves any member of the Intelligence\nCommunity that originates covered information from its obligation to provide that\ninformation to DHS and other covered entities, as appropriate, in a form consistent with\nthis Agreement, the DHS Legislation, and other relevant statutes and authorities\nregarding the protection of sources and methods.\n6. \"Sanitization\" and Modification of Classification Levels for Further Sharing by DHS.\n(a) Consistent with the President's announced policies, our national priorities,\nincluding this section. Section 3(a), and other relevant provisions of this Agreement, the\nDHS Legislation and other relevant statutes and Presidential Directives, covered entities\nthat originate covered information that is classified shall retain the authority to determine\nwhether that information, or any portions thereof, must remain classified in the interest of\nnational security.\n(i)\nCovered entities shall ensure that covered information that is\nclassified or otherwise subject to restricted dissemination, but which reasonably\nappears likely to require onward passage to state, local, or private sector officials,\nthe public, or other law enforcement officials for use in a criminal investigation,\nreaches DHS promptly with accompanying high-content \"tear lines\" suitable for\nonward passage at an unclassified level. Until this can be achieved\n\n\fsimultaneously to the transmission of covered information, the development of\nsuch tearlines shall not delay the provision of covered information.\n(ii)\nThe parties shall ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that\ncovered entities utilize agreed-upon standardized formatting for preparation of\ntear-line material for passage to state, local, or private sector officials, including\nstate and local law enforcement officials for use in a law enforcement\ninvestigation, or to the public, with the goal of providing necessary substantive\ninformation, but not enabling recipients to determine the originator, within the\nFederal government, of the information.\n(b)\nDHS may, on its own initiative or at the request of a homeland security\nofficial to whom covered information is disseminated, ask that the originating agency\ndeclassify or ieduce the classification level attached to that information in order to permit\ndissemination to udditiorial officials who have a need-to-know the information, to\npromote ease of handling by those authorized to review it, to permit its incorporation into\na document that is unclassified or classified at a lower level, or for other purposes\nconsistent with the need promptly to provide homeland security officials with all relevant\ncovered information that they have a nccd-to-know in the conduct of their official duties.\nWhenever it rcccives such a request, the originating agency shall respond to DHS, within\n24 hours t or such longer period as is agreed to by all parties), unless compelling\ncircumstances exist to require a longer response time. Such response will either —\n(i)\nagree to declassify or reduce the classification ievel of the covered\ninformation in question as requested; or\n(ii)\nprovide an alternative formulation responsive to the requester's\nneed for additional information sharing, but without declassifying or reducing the\nclassification of the original document or covered information where that cannot\nbe done consistent with assuring the national security.\n(c)\nWhere the need by DHS for further dissemination of classified\ninformation received from other covered entities, including through declassification or\nthe preparation of unclassified tear-lines, is urgent because that information contains or\ninay contain terrorist threat indications critical to the ability of homeland security\nofficials to prevent, preempt, or disrupt a possible terrorist attack, that information may\nbe passed directly to the entity or official that has a necd-to-know that information,\nprovided thai the covered entity passing the information first notifies the originating\nagency and takes steps reasonable under the exigent circuinstanccs to protect whatever\nclassified informaiiou is not essential to initiating the urgent homeland security assurance\nmeasures that may be required.\n(d)\nThe parties agree to develop together, as soon as practicable, mechanisms\nand procedures, including through the use of detailees and assignees to the TTIC and\nJITFs, as appropriate, to carry oul the provisions of Section 6. The parties agree to work\n\nIS\n\n\ftogether to ensure that the administrative, financial, and personnel burdens of this section\nare shared to the greatest extent possible among covercd entities.\n7.\nDetail or Assignment of Personnel. To facilitate the information sharing,\ncoordination, and deconfliction policies covered in this Agreement, covered entities shall detail,\nand/or assign, to the greatest extent possible, including to the TTIC and/or JTTFs, personnel who\nhave the authority either to make classification review and redaction decisions themselves, or,\nconsistent with the time frames established in this Agreement, to refer those decisions to the\nappropriate officials at the originating agency for prompt action.\n8.\nDHS Participation in Requirements Processes. As soon as practicable, the parties\nshall modify existing mechanisms and processes for prioritization of terrorism, WMD and other\nrelevant foreign intelligence collection (including within the United States) and requirements\nprocesses to ensure that DHS has meaningful participation at each stage and level of each such\nmechanism or proccss, including through participation in the TTIC. The parties also shall work\ntogether to provide recommendations as to whether, and how, processes or mcchanisms for\npurely \"domestic\" terrorism (e.g., concerning the capabilities, plans and intentions of exclusively\ndomestic white supremacist or militia groups), and other relevant intelligence collection should\nbe created or, alternatively, how to ensure meaningful participation by DHS in the prioritization\nfor gathering such information. This section does not refer to operational activities\n9.\nDatabases. The parties agree to establish procedures and mechanisms to provide\nDHS, and. as appropriate and practicable, other covered entities, with acccss :o databases\ncontaining covered information. To this end, the parties shall establish a working group, within\n30 days of the date of this Agreement. Developed procedures and mechanisms, including\nthrough the use of the TTIC and/or JTTFs, should be consistent with the DHS Legislation and\nother relevant statutory authorities. Presidential Directives, the President's announced policies\nfor protecting against terrorist threats to the homeland, and the appropriate needs for access by\nDHS to appropriate databases, as well as with the protection of intelligence or sensitive law\nenforcement sources and methods, and with Section 3(a) and other provisions of this Agreement\nSuch procedures and mcchanisms should facilitate, to the greatest possible extent: ease and\nspeed of information exchange; differentiated access, to allow individuals with different levels of\nsecurity clearancc and need-to-know to have different levels of access to databases; and\ncompatibility with other databases of covered entities.\n10.\nStatement of Jfflent Concerning Information J^hnolggY It is the intent of the\nparties to build and modernize all relevant databases and other information technology systems\nin order to maximize compatibility with other systems wnh which they must interact. Such\nprocedures and mechanisms also must comply with existing statutory and Presidential\nDirectives, including with regard to ihc protection of classified information and applicable\nprivacy protections\n11.\nHandling and Storage. The parties shall ensure that covercd entities within their\njurisdiction observe the established handling and storage standards appropriate to the\nclassification and access restrictions indicated on covered information they rcceive, use, and\n\n\n\fdisseminate, subject only to the provisions of this Agreement pertaining to exigent\ncircumstances.\n12.\nInformation collected and shared bv foreign governments This Agreement\ncontemplates a separate Memorandum of Understanding, consistent with this Agreement, being\nagreed to by the parties, that addresses conccrns related to information collected and shared by\nforeign governments.\n13.\n\nimplementation.\n\n(a)\nEach of the parties shall implement their responsibilities under this\nAgreement as to the covered entities under their jurisdiction through such binding\nregulations, orders, directives, and guidance as necessary or prudent from time to time.\n(b)\nAny authonty or duty assigned herein to the Attorney General, the\nSecretary, or the DCl, may be delegated to one or more subordinate officials at the\ndiscretion of the official to whom the authority or duty is assigned, except as otherwise\nprovided in this Agreement. Each such delegation shall be promptly communicalcd to all\nother parties.\n14.\nNo Private Riahts Created. These procedures are not intended to and do not\ncreate any rights, privileges, or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any individual\nor organization against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers\nor employees, or any other person.\n15.\nCounterpart Signatures.

The TSDB is also known as the \"vvatchlist.\"\nThis protocol is designed to ensure consistent and appropriate handling of watchlist\ninformation. The protocol responds to issues raised by the report of the Inspector\nGeneral, dated March 14, 2008, entitled \"Audit of the U.S. Department of Justice\nTerrorist Watchlist Nomination Processes.\" Specifically, that report recommended that\nthe Dcpartmeiv. adopt a general policy for submission of watch lisl nominations.\nImplementation of the attached protocol will accomplish that task.\nAll components are directed to comply with this protocol effective immediately.\nDEPARTMENT OF JUS'I ICE PROTOCOL\nREGARDING TERRORIST WATCIIUST NOMINATIONS\nA. Background\n1. Un September 16, 2003, the President directed the Attorney General in I lomcland\nSecurity Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-fi) to \"establish an organization to consolidate\nthe Government's approach to terrorism screening and provide for the appropriate and\nlawful use o f : crrorist Information in screening processes.\" Terrorist Information was\nspecifically defined to mean \"individuals known or appropriately suspectcd to be or have\nbeen engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for. in aid of, or related to\nterrorism.\"\n2. Concurrent with the signing of I ISPD-6, the Memorandum of Understanding on the\nIntegmtioii\n\nand Use oj Screening Information to i'rotccl Against Terrorism (TSC MOU>,\n\nwas signed by the Secretaries of Slate and I lomcland Security, the Attorney General and\nI\n\nPage 1 of\n\n\fthe Director of Central Intelligence (DC1) (on behalf of the entire U.S. Intelligence\nCommunity). The I SC MOU established the Terrorist Screening Center (TSCi to\nconsolidate the Ciovcmmcnt's approach to terrorism screening and provide for the\nappropriate and lawful use of Terrorist Information, a term clarified by the inclusion of\nTenorist Identifiers in subsequent agreement of the parties. I Inder HSPD-6. the TSC\nwas develop and maintain a database, to the extent permitted by law, containing the\nmost thorough, accurate, and currcnt information possible about known or suspcctcd\nterrorists. IISPD-b icquires that its implementation be consistent with the Constitution\nand applicable laws, including those protecting the rights of all Americans. The TSC\ncrcated the I'eiTorist Screening Database (TSDU) to meet these goals, The TSDB\nconsolidates the U.S. Government's terrorism screening and lookout databases into ¡1\nsingle integral ;d identities database. Ihc TSDB is uiso known as the \"watehlist.\"\n3. The ISC MOD also incorporated all provisions of the Memorandum oft 'ndcrstanding\n/><•/HVI'H rlic Intelligence Community. Federal low Enforcement Ayyni-ws. •tin/ the\ni)r/'(irimcnt of Homeland Security Concerning hifomutlton Sharing, dated March -I, 200 *\n\n(Ihc \"Information Sharing MOU\").\n4. In 2001. (he Secretaries of State. Treasury, and Defense became signatories to ihc\ninformation Sharing MOU by signing Addendum A to the TSC MOU. By doing so. they\nagreed that all provisions of Ihc TSC MOU and the Information Sharing MOt • apply to\nall entities that arc or become a part of their respective Departments.\n5. \\ second addendum (Addendum B), which supplements and incorporates by reference\nall pi .»visions > I the TSC MOU, superseded Addendum A and was linali/ed on January\n! K, 2007. The Directors of National Intelligence, NCTC, and ihc TSC joined as\nsignatories in Addendum B. Under paragraph (1) (b) of Addendum II the Parties agreed,\nlo the maximum extent permitted by law, to \"provide to the NCTC on an ongoing basis\nall Terrorism Information (as defined in\nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004. Section 1016(a)\n(•I) |a.s amended to include homeland security information ami weapons of mass\ndestruction information] in llicir possession, custody, or controI. Paragraph 7 ol\nAddendum B introduces the term Terrorist Identifiers Jo more clearly describe Ihc type of\nterrorism information that NCTC (and the Federal Bureau ol Investigation (FBI) for\nPurely Domestic Terrorism Information, as defined in the TSC MOD) receives from\ninteragency partners and subsequently shares with \"I SC for inclusion m the TSDB.\n(>. I'xeeulivc Order 13354 (August 27, 2004) created the National Counlcrterrorism\nCenle.i (NC'I'C) to serve as the primary organization in the United States Government lor\nanalyzing and nlcgrnting all intelligence possessed or acquired by the United States\nGovernment pertaining to terrorism and eounlcrtcirorism. excepting purely domestic\ncomitei terrorism information. That same provision, however, provides that NCTC may\nreceive, retain, and disseminate information from anv Federal. State, or local government.\n( i oihci MHirce necessary to fuBill its responsibilities, giving NCIC authority to reecive,\nretain, ami disseminate domestic terrorism informalion.\n\n\f>\n\nT3\nTJ\n<T>\n7. Section 1021 ofthc Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act ol 2004\n(IRTPA) amended the National Security Act of 1947 to codify the creation of NCTC.\nPursuant to IRTPA, NCTC serves \"as the central and shared knowledge hank on known\nand suspcctcd terrorists and international terror groups.\" NCTC's centrali/.cd knowledge\nbank is known as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDIi). Section 1021(c)\non Domestic Countertcrrorisin Intelligence states NCTC \"may, consistent with applicable\nlaw, the direction of the President, and guidelines referred to in section K)2A(b), receive\nintelligence pertaining exclusively to domestic counlcrtcrrorism from any Federal, State,\nor local government or other sourcc nccessary to fulfill its responsibilities and retain and\ndisseminate such intelligente.\"\nH. To cnhancc information sharing, the President issued Fxeculive Order 13388, Further\nStrengthening\n\nthe Sharing of Terrorism information to Protect Americans (October 25,\n\n2005), which requires the head of caeh agcncy thai possesses or acquires terrorism\ninformation to promptly give access to that information to the head of cuch other agency\nthat has counierlcrrorism functions.\nPursuant to paragraph (2) of HSPD-6, NCTC is mandated to \"provide [TSC| with\n¡•.eccss to all appropriate information or intelligence in the [NCTC's| custody, possession,\nor control that TSC| requires to perform its functions.\"\n10. TIDE serves as the single source for the TSDB, cxccpt for Purely Domestic Terrorism\nInformation, which is provided dircctly to the I SC from the Fill via a lormali/.ed\nprocedure. Purely Domestic Terrorism Information is defined in Ihc TSC MOU as \"/.<• ,\ninformation about U.S. persons that has been determined lo be purely domestic terrorism\ninformation with no link lo foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international\nterrorism.\"\n11. TlDIi contains the identifying and derogatory information on known or appropriately\nsuspected international terrorists and the FBI's Automated Case Support system contains\nsupporting information regarding purely domestic terrorists. The TSDB contains the\nidentifiers exported from TlDIi and the identifiers of domestic terrorists exported by the\nFBI. As it result, the TSDB contains the U.S. Government's comprehensive database of\nboth international and domestic Terrorist Identifiers.\nB. Nominating Components\nI. The Department of Justice contains a number of components thai may acquire\ninformation regarding domestic or international terrorists. These components include the\nFBI, the TSC. the National Security Division, the Criminal Division, the Civil Rights\nDivision, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United Slates Marshals Service, the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, The Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nthe Executive Office ofthc United States Attorneys, the United States Attorneys, and the\nUnited States National Central Bureau.\n\n\nPage ? of 5\n\n\f>\n•a\n\n2. The policy of the Department oUuslicc is lor all components lit provide the FIJI with\nall domestic or international Terrorism Information or Terrorist Identifiers so that the \"?•!\ncan make appropriate nominations to the consolidated terrorist wnlchlisl. With one\ncxccption relating to I SO's authority in exigent circumstances, only the FBI is authorized\nto nominate domestic or international terrorists for inclusion in the TSDB on behalf of the\nDepartment of Justice. The FBI has implemented policies governing llie submission of\nsuch nominations, including procedures to follow when adding, modifying, or deleting a\nTSDB record, in making any proposed recommendation for watch listing, each UOJ\ncomponent shculd ensure that the underlying information is reasonably accurate, relevant\nand timely. In addition, the'I'SC has implemented its Protocol Regan/int; Terrtmst\ndominations These policies must be followed regarding all nominations from the\n\"department of Justice\n5. The TSC, which is administered by the FBI and reports to the Attorney General, is\npermitted to make entries into (he TSDB when exigent circumstances exist. Such\nexpedited nominations must be made in compliance with the FBI nomination policies and\nthe TSC's Protocol Rvgariling Terrorist\n\nNominations.\n\n•I. The Joint Terrorism Task Forccs (JTTF) are a mulli-ageney effort led by the\nDepartmenl of Justice and the FBI to combine and leverage law enforcement and\nintelligence community resources to prolcet the United States from terrorist attack. ITU's\narc comprised of highly trained, locally based, investigators, analysts, linguists, and other\nspecialists from Federal, stale, local, tribal, territorial law enforcement and intelligence\ncommunity agencies. The National JTTF was established in July 2002 to serve as the\ncoordinating mechanism for the JTTFs.\n5. Department of Justice components, other than the FBI or the TSC. are noi permitted to\nmake direct nominations to the TSDB. A Department of Justice component should\ninform the appropriate JTIT through disseminated intelligence reports, electronic\ncommunication, or other method appropriate to ihc circumstances when it becomes aware\noI\" Terrorist Information, T errorist Identifiers, or Purely Domestic Terrorism Information\n(collectively, Intelligence Information). The originating DOJ component should stale\nwhether it recommends watch listing the individual, the basis for lhat recommendation,\nand the investigative steps, if any, it has undertaken regarding the individual. If the JTTF\ndetermines lhat the inlormalion received from another component standing alone or in\nconjunction with other information known to the FBI meets the standards set forth in the\nAttorney General's Guidelines lor opening a preliminary terrorism investigation or a full\nterrorism investigation and one has not been opened, the I' i F shall initiate an\ninvestigation a.ul shall nominate case subjects for inclusion in TIDF. and/or the I SDH in\naccordance with FBI |K>licy, by forwarding all Intelligence Information, as appropriate, to\nthe FBI's Terrorist Review and Examination I'nit (T RliX) using the IT >-V30 form and\nprocess.\n<>. The relevant JTTF w ill notify Ihc Departmenl of Justice component that Inle.lligeoee\nInformation provided by thai component has been used, in whole or in part, as the basis\nTor a nomination to the TSDB or (he creation of a record in TTDIi. To the extent possible.\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\n=\n-J\n\n\f>\n\nn\n-a\no\n\nthe relevant J'lTF will assign a representative from the nominating Department ol Justice\ncomponent to participate in the preliminary or lull investigation that arises out of\nnominations from Department of Justice components. Once notified, the Department\ncomponent will promptly provide FBI's TREX with additions, modi flattions, or deletions\nlo a particular record as appropriate regarding that Intelligence Information via the\ncomponent's J fTF representative.\n7. To prevent possible duplicate or partial reporting, the NCTC shall be informed that the\nFBI and the TSC arc the sole TIDE and/or TSDB nominating agencies lor the\nDepartment of Justice.\nK.

It was originally developed to help\nstandardize the watchlisting community's nomination and screening processes. Since approval of\nthe Watchlisting Guidance in July of 2010, the guidance and its related appendices have\nundergone a thorough interagency review as a result of a May 2010 Deputy's Committee tasking\nto the White House National Security Staff Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy\nCommittee (IPC) that any significant issues or required changes be brought back to the Deputies\nfor discussion. The Information Sharing and Access IPC identified a number of changes in\nDepartment and Agency watchlisting practices that had evolved since dissemination of the\nguidance in 2010. In order to reflect these changes, the 2013 Watchlisting Guidance was\ndeveloped over a period of several months by an IPC under the auspices of the Presidential Policy\nDirective -One (PPD 1) process with representatives from the Departments of State, Treasury,\nDefense, Justice and Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the\nCentral Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the\nNational Counterterrorism Center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Terrorist\nScreening Center. The Deputies Committee adopted the recommendation of the IPC to approve\nthe 2013 Watchlisting Guidance on March 12, 2013.\n(U//FOUO) The 2013 Watchlisting Guidance has a new structure and is organized in a way that\nmirrors the watchlisting cycle. It is now a single document divided as follows into fives chapters,\nwith significant watchlisting foundational documents for reference, and a list of definitions,\nacronyms, and abbreviations:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nChapter 1: Watchlisting Process and Procedures;\nChapter 2: Minimum Identifying Criteria;\nChapter 3: Minimum Substantive Derogatory Criteria;\nChapter 4: No Fly, Selectee and Expanded Selectee Lists Implementation Guidance;\nChapter 5; Encounter Management and Analysis;\nAppendix 1: Definitions;\nAppendix 2: Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6;\nAppendix 3; Memorandum of Understanding on the Integration and Use of Screening\nInformation to Protect Against Terrorism (TSC MOD);\nAppendix 4; Addendum B to the TSC MOU;\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/ SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION\nWARNING: This record contains Sensitive Security Information that is controlled under 49 C F R parts 15 and 1520.\nN o part of this record may be disclosed to persons without a \"need to know\", as defined in 4 9 CFR parts 15 and 1520,\nexcept with the written permission of the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration or the\nSecretary of Transportation. Unauthorized release may result in civil penalty or other action.

Section 44903(j)(2)(C)(v)) (Chapter 4);\n\n•\n\nUse of the One Time Waiver Policy is addressed to facilitate travel under controlled\nconditions of certain U.S. Citizen Known or Suspected Terrorists (Chapter 4);\n\n•\n\nThe guidance reflects the creation of the Expanded Selectee List, an export to the\nTransportation Security Administration of Known and Suspected Terrorist records within\nthe Terrorist Screening Database that contain a full name and complete date of birth to\nsupport airline passenger screening (Chapter 4); and\n\n•\n\nThe guidance reflects the authority of the Terrorist Screening Center Director to make\nindividual watchlist determinations (i.e., placement on the No Fly, Selectee and Expanded\nSelectee Lists) during exigent circumstanccs (Chapter 4).\n\n(U//FOUO) These changes to the Watchlisting Guidance are intended to make the watchlisting\nprocess more flexible, agile, and inclusive in order to respond to additional terrorism threats while\nproviding the watchlisting community detailed guidance concerning the watchlisting policy of the\nU.S. Government.\n(U//FOUO) The 2013 Watchlisting Guidance describes the U.S. Government's comprehensive\nwatchlisting policies and process and includes Sensitive Security Information. Accordingly,\nDepartments and Agencies who received copies of the 2013 Watchlisting Guidance arc instructed\nto carefully control and share the guidance with only those individuals who are directly involved\nin the terrorist watchlisting and screening process.\n\nUNCLASS1FIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/ SENSITIVE SECURI TY INFORMATION\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/ SENSITIVE SECURI TY INFORMATION\n\n(U) Nothing in the 2013 Watchiisting Guidance is intended to restrict the authority of any\nDepartment or Agency to act as provided by law, statute, or regulation, or to restrict any Agency\nfrom enforcing any laws within its authority or jurisdiction.\n\nUNCLASS1FIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/ SENSITIVE SECURI TY INFORMATION\n\n\fU N C L A S S I F I E D / / F O R OFFICIAL USE ONLY/ SENSITIVE SECURITY I N F O R M A T I O N\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMAITON\nWARNING: This record contains Sensitive Security Information that is controlled under 49 CFR\nparts 15 and 1520.

Introduction to\nFAA section 702\n\nIntroduction to FAA section 702\n\n1. Compel Providers\na. Non-US persons\n\nAs described in the briefing accompanying this training, in July 2008,\nCongress enacted the “Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978\nAmendments Act of 2008” (FAA.) One of the primary purposes in\nenacting the FAA was the creation of a new way for the US\nGovernment to compel providers of electronic communications\nservices to assist the Government in acquiring foreign intelligence\ninformation concerning non-US persons located outside the United\nStates. This process is described in Section 702 of FAA. Almost all of\nthe 1978 law remained intact, and Section 702 of FAA is best\nunderstood as an exception to FISA for such targets.\n\nb. Outside the United\nStates\nc. FAA 702 = an\nexception\n\n2. Court Orders\na. FISA section F1-F4\ndid not change\nb. Non-US persons &\npersons inside the\nUnited States need a\nFISC order\nc. FISC orders need a\nprobable cause case.\n\nCompel Providers\n\nFISC orders for US persons or persons located\ninside the United States\nThe definitions of “electronic surveillance” in FISA were not changed,\nso any collection that uses methods that fall within them and is directed\nat anyone inside the United States or at US persons abroad still requires\na court order. The Government must give the court probable cause to\nbelieve that each target is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power\nbefore the court will issue an order compelling a communications\nservice provider to assist with the targeting.\n\n3. FAA 702 – for:\na. fast targeting and\nb. a high volume of\ntargets\n\nTime sensitive targets and high volume of targets\n\n4. The means:\na. AG/DNI\ncertifications (certs)\napproved by FISC\nb. Directives to\nproviders\n\nThe means used:\n\n5. Certs\na. DNI & AG approve\nb. At NSA – DIRNSA\napproves\n\nCertification details\n\nUnder section 702 of FAA, however, the Government may compel the\nsame type of assistance in a way that is much more time-sensitive and\nmore suitable for collection directed at a higher volume of targets.\n\nThe means used by the Government to compel this assistance is in the\nform of “certifications” issued jointly by the Attorney General and the\nDirector of National Intelligence that are approved by the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and “directives” to the\nproviders ordering them to assist the government.\n\nIn a “certification”, the DNI and AG certify that specific requirements\nof the law have been met, and describe how this has been done. When\nthe collection is being done by NSA, DIRNSA also makes\nrepresentations to support the certification. If the court determines that\nthe statutory requirements for a certification have been met, it issues an\norder to this effect, and the collection may begin.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\nI. Introduction to FAA\nsection 702 cont’d\nc.\n\nIndividual certs\nhave unique\nhandling rules.\n\nd. AG/DNI have\nissued topical certs\ni. 2008-A = Foreign\nGov’t (FG)\nii. 2008-B =\nCounterterrorism\n(CT)\n\n6. Analysts concern:\n\nFor this reason, NSA personnel who are going to be involved in the\ncollection, processing or dissemination of data gathered pursuant to\nSection 702 of FAA must understand the requirements and\nresponsibilities associated with a certification to ensure they are acting\nin accordance with the representations made to the FISC by the DNI,\nAG and DIRNSA. In other words, the various parts of a certification lay\nout the rules of the road for collection and handling of data pursuant to\nFAA, and this training is designed to assist you in becoming familiar\nwith their terms. (A certification may also contain representations made\nby other federal agencies that assist in the collection and/or are\nauthorized to receive the proceeds of what NSA is collecting pursuant to\nFAA. Their terms are only of peripheral interest to most NSA personnel,\nso they will not be discussed in great detail.)\nAlthough Section 702 of the FAA provides a framework of requirements\nfor issuance of a certification, it does not say how that framework must\nbe used. To date, the AG and DNI have issued certifications that are\ntopically based: a certification that authorizes targeting directed at\nforeign governments, factions, entities and foreign based political\norganizations (Certification 2008-A) and a certification that authorizes\ntargeting directed at groups engaged in international terrorism or\nactivities in preparation therefore (Certification 2008-B). Each will be\ndiscussed in turn.\n\nSince this video was recorded in December 2008, a FAA\nCertification 2009-C – WMD/Proliferation certification\nhas been approved. Refer to pg. 14 of this document.\n\na. Authorized targets\n(Exhibit F)\n\nb. Foreignness\nprocedures\n(Exhibit A)\n\nc. Minimization\nprocedures\n(Exhibit B)\n\nd. Trained to know\nwhen a target fits\nthe cert\n\nDay to day Analysts’\nattention\nAs described in the briefing, on a day-to-day basis, most analysts will\nneed to be particularly concerned with:\n- the portions of the certifications that describe which\nforeign intelligence targets have been authorized for\ncollection in general terms by the Attorney General\nand DNI (typically, “Exhibit F” to a certification),\n- the procedures for determining that there is a\nreasonable belief that a particular target is a non-US\nperson located outside the United States (typically\n“Exhibit A” to a certification) and\n- the minimization procedures that govern handling of\nUS person (USP) information acquired in the course\nof collection directed at non-US persons reasonably\nbelieved to be located outside the US who fit within\nthe terms of the authorization (typically “Exhibit B”\nto a certification.)\nThus, at the end of this training, NSA personnel should know how to\nfind out whether a proposed target fits within the terms of a certification,\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\nknow where to find the rules for targeting, and know where to find the\nrules for handling the US person information they acquire. Because the\ncertifications and the associated rules are subject to change,\nunderstanding where to find NSA’s responsibilities and restrictions is\nevery bit as important as becoming familiar with the specifics of their\nterms at the current time.\n\nII. Cert 2008-A\nForeign Gov’ts\n1. DIRNSA’s\nAffidavit\n2008-A Affidavit\n\nCertification 2008-A: Targeting Directed at\nForeign Governments and Similar Entities\nDIRNSA’s affidavit\nDIRNSA’s affidavit to Certification 2008-A states the following:\n\na. Non-US person\nb. Outside of the\nUnited States\n\nNSA has adopted procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that\nall targeting is directed at non-US persons reasonably believed to be\noutside the United States (“Exhibit A”, described below)\n\nc. Using US\nelectronic\ncommunications\ncarriers\n\nThis collection will be accomplished by a variety of means at switches\nand other parts of the infrastructure of companies that provide electronic\ncommunications services to people abroad from within the United\nStates.\n\nd. Purpose\ni. Foreign\nintelligence\nii. Concerning\nForeign Gov’t\n\nThe collection will seek to acquire foreign intelligence information\nconcerning foreign governments, factions thereof and similar types of\nentities, and also states that a list of the entities that will be targeted is\nincluded as “Exhibit F” (described below.) It also states that if NSA\nwants to target a foreign government or other similar entity that is not on\nthis list, it may do so, but it has to notify the AG and DNI within 5 days\nof implementing the targeting.\n\ne. Minimize US\nperson info\n\nWhen NSA personnel come across information concerning US persons,\nthey will follow minimization procedures attached to the certification\n(“Exhibit B”, described below)\n\nf. CIA/FBI sharing\n\nNSA may disseminate to CIA unevaluated data that comes from\ncollection pursuant to this certification and that CIA requests in order to\ncarry out its clandestine espionage and counterintelligence activities\nabroad.\nNSA may also disseminate to FBI, at FBI’s request, unevaluated data\nthat comes from collection pursuant to this certification.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n2. Targeting Procedures\n(Exhibit A)\n2008-A Exhibit A\n\na. Part I – Location\ni. Located outside of\nthe United States\nii. Totality of\ncircumstances\n1. Lead information\n\nTargeting Procedures (Exhibit A)\nThese procedures address one of the central requirements of the FAA:\ndetermination that the targeting is limited to non-United States\npersons outside the United States. It does so in four parts.\n\nPart 1 – Location\nPart 1 discusses how NSA will make a determination that a person\nbeing targeted is located outside the United States. It notes that the\ndetermination is made in light of the totality of the circumstances.\nNSA analysts look at lead information they have received on the\ntarget; they conduct research in NSA databases available reports and\ncollateral information, and they conduct technical analyses of the\nemail addresses or other facilities to be targeted. They can use\ninformation from any one or a combination of these categories of\ninformation to determine that the potential target is outside the United\nStates. Part 1 addresses each of these categories in greater detail,\nwith examples of how they are applied to targeting of phone numbers\nand email addresses.\n\n2. Seeking info\n“about” a target\n– requires filters\n\nIt also notes that when NSA is seeking to acquire communications\nabout the target that are not to or from the target, it will employ IP\nfilters or similar technology to ensure that the collection is directed at\na party to communications reasonably believed to be outside the\nUnited States.\n\n3. Presumption of\nstatus based on\nlocation\n\nPart 1 also provides similar guidance on assessment of a potential\ntarget’s status as a non-US person. It notes that information on a\npotential target’s location is frequently useful in determining his\nstatus as well. It notes that in the absence of specific information\nregarding a potential target’s status, if a person is reasonably believed\nto be located outside the United States, he will also be presumed to be\na non-US person, unless/until he can be positively identified as a US\nperson or the nature or circumstances of his communication give rise\nto a reasonable belief to the contrary.\n\n4. Target possesses\nand is likely to\ncommunicate\nforeign\nintelligence\n\nBecause one of the things certified by the AG and DNI is that the\npurpose of the collection is to gather foreign intelligence, part 1 also\naddresses how NSA will assess whether the target possesses and/or is\nlikely to communicate information of foreign intelligence value\nconcerning a foreign power or foreign territory. NSA can not target\nsomeone merely because he is located outside the US; there has to be\nsome reason to believe that the targeting will acquire foreign\nintelligence. This requirement, and most of the factors listed in this\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n2. Targeting Procedures\ncont’d\n2008-A Exhibit A\n\nb. Part II –Location\nchange detection\n\ni.\n\nDetect if a target\nenters the United\nStates\n\nii.\n\nOr if the target is\na US person\n\nsection are intuitive to NSA analysts, and include information that\nindicates the target has communicated with someone associated with\na foreign power or territory, information in public directories that link\na phone number to someone associated with a foreign power or\nforeign territory.\n\nPart 2 – Detecting target location or status changes\nPart 2 describes steps that will be taken by NSA after targeting has\nbegun to ensure that it detects when a target has entered the United\nStates, despite a reasonable belief to the contrary when targeting was\ninitiated. These steps are designed to prevent NSA from collecting\ndomestic communications as well as any targeting of persons who are\ninside the United States. NSA looks at registers of roaming cell\nphones, IP addresses of Internet communications and similar\ntechnical information, but in many cases, it will be the content of a\ncommunication that indicates that a target has entered the United\nStates. If NSA determines that a target has entered the United States\nor that a target thought to be a non-US person is in fact a US person,\nit must terminate collection without delay and take additional steps\ndescribed in Part 4 below.\n\nc. Part III – identify the\nforeign power\n\nPart 3 – Identifying the foreign power\n\nd. Part IV – Oversight\n\nPart 4 – Oversight and reporting\n\ni.\n\nO&C/OGC\n\nii.\n\nDOJ/ODNI\n\nPart 3 states that before collection can begin, analysts must document\none or more citations to the information that led them to believe that a\ntarget was located outside the United States. They must also identify\nthe foreign power or foreign territory about which they expect to\nobtain foreign intelligence so that people conducting oversight of\nNSA’s collection can see how the Agency is meeting the\nrequirements established by the AG and DNI in their certification.\n\nPart 4 describes oversight and compliance responsibilities associated\nwith collection done pursuant to Certification 2008-A. The SID\noffice of Oversight and Compliance (O&C), together with the OGC,\nis required to develop training on the rules associated with FAA\ncollection. O&C must also ensure that raw traffic from FAA\ncollection is labeled and stored only in authorized repositories and\naccessible only to those who have had such training. O&C is also\nrequired to conduct periodic spot checks to ensure that NSA is\nmeeting its responsibilities with regard to targeting, dissemination\nand other activities associated with FAA collection.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of\nNational Intelligence (ODNI) also conduct independent oversight of\nNSA’s activities, with reviews at least once every 60 days.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\nNSA must report to DOJ, the ODNI Office of General Counsel and\nthe to the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection Officer, any incidents of\nnoncompliance with targeting procedures that result in intentional\niii. Reporting incidents targeting of persons reasonably believe to be located in the United\nto ODNI CLPO, DOJ, and States or the intentional acquisition of domestic communications.\nThese reports must be made within 5 days of NSA learning of the\nODNI OJC for:\nincident. Any information acquired by intentionally targeting a US\nperson or a person nor reasonably believed to be outside the United\n1. Intentional\nStates at the time of targeting has to be purged from NSA\nviolations\ndatabases.\n\n2. Targeting Procedures\ncont’d - 2008-A Exhibit A\n\nPart 4 also repeats the requirement that if NSA targets someone in\nthe reasonable belief that he is a non-United States person outside\nthe United States and later finds out that the target is inside the\nUnited States or is in fact a US person (no matter where he is\nlocated), it must cease the targeting without delay. Any\ninformation gathered prior to determining that the target was a US\nperson or located inside the United States has to be handled in\naccordance with the relevant minimization procedures (Exhibit B,\ndiscussed below.) In addition, NSA must report the incident to\nDOJ, the ODNI Office of General Counsel and the ODNI Civil\nLiberties Officer within 5 days.\n\n2. Mistakes\n\n3.

Definitions\n\nMinimization Procedures (Exhibit B)\nThe minimization procedures for Certification 2008-A are modeled\non NSA’s Standard Minimization Procedures (Annex A to USSID\n18), but contain some significant differences. It is important to\nkeep in mind that they govern the\nprocessing/retention/dissemination of information concerning US\npersons that is collected in the course of targeting non-United\nStates persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States.\nAny restrictions on the handling of data that does not concern US\npersons come from another source (e.g., concerns about the\npotential risk to sources and methods.) All of the requirements in\nthe procedures will not be repeated verbatim here, but NSA\npersonnel working with FAA data should review their terms\nclosely.\n\nThe definitions section is the first substantive portion of the\nprocedures and should be reviewed carefully for obvious reasons.\nRestrictions on the handling of information concerning “US\npersons” can not be properly applied unless one understands what\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n3.

It is distinct from\nthe dissemination of reporting to foreign governments,\nwhich is governed by Section 6. NSA can share or\nexchange foreign communications with the governments of\nAustralia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand,\nbut only with their written assurance that they will use the\ncommunications subject to the limits on retention and\ndissemination within the procedures. Domestic\ncommunications may not be shared with them, and\nordinarily, NSA analysts must remove US person identifiers\nthat are not necessary to understand or assess the foreign\nintelligence contained within foreign plain text\ncommunications.\nEncrypted communications may also be shared, as may\ncommunications for which the Second Parties’ linguistic or\ntechnical assistance is required. However, there are\nsignificant limitations on what the Second Parties can do\nwith such unevaluated communications and NSA has\nadditional responsibilities with regard to ensuring that the\nmaterial is handled properly.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n4. Target list (Exhibit F)\n2008-A Exhibit F\n\nThe foreign government groups that are the\nsubject of Certification 2008-A (Exhibit F)\nThe foreign governments, factions, foreign entities and\nforeign based political organizations that are the subject of\nCertification 2008-A (Exhibit F)\nIn 2008-A, the DNI and AG state that the foreign\nintelligence information to be acquired pursuant to the\ncertification concerns foreign powers as defined in specific\nparts of FISA. They also state that the entities listed in\nExhibit F fit within these definitions. This means that NSA\ncan target individuals reasonably believed to be non-US\npersons located outside the United States to acquire\ninformation concerning these entities. If NSA wants to\ntarget an individual who is reasonably believed to be a nonUnited States person located outside the United States in\norder to obtain information concerning a foreign power that\nfits within these definitions, but which is not on the list it\nmay do so. However, it must notify the AG and DNI within\n5 days of implementing such targeting.

DIRNSA’s Affidavit\n\nThe only difference from\n2008-A is the TARGET\nSET\n\nDIRNSA’s affidavit\nThe only difference between this affidavit and the affidavit for\n2008-A is that it reflects that the certification concerns a different\nset of targets. The collection in this case will seek to acquire\nforeign intelligence information concerning groups engaged in\ninternational terrorism. Similar to 2008-A, the certification for\nforeign governments and similar entities, it states that a list of the\nterrorist groups that will be targeted is included as “Exhibit F”\n(described below). It also states that if NSA wants to target a\nforeign terrorist group that is not on this list, it may do so, but it\nhas to notify the AG and DNI within 5 days of implementing the\ntargeting.\n\n2.

They also state that the groups listed in Exhibit F\nfit within this definition. This means that NSA can target\nindividuals reasonably believed to be non-US persons located\noutside the United States to acquire information concerning these\ngroups. If NSA wants to target an individual who is reasonably\nbelieved to be a non-US person located outside the United States\nin order to obtain information concerning a foreign terrorist group\nthat fits within this definition, but which is not on the list it may\ndo so. However, it must notify the AG and DNI within 5 days of\nimplementing such targeting.

DIRNSA’s Affidavit\n\n2009-C has no Exhibit F\nInstead of identifying\ntarget affiliations, 2009-C\ndescribes activities\n1. Proliferating WMD\n2. Supply of WMD parts\n3. Sales of disruptive\ntechnologies\n4. Sales of advanced\nconventional\nweapons\n\n2. Targeting Procedures\n(Exhibit A)\n\nDIRNSA’s affidavit\nDIRNSA’s affidavit for 2009-C is quite different from those for\n2008-A and 2008-B. 2008-A and 2008-B contained lists of\nspecific targets, in an “Exhibit F” attached to the certifications.\n2009-C does not contain a similar list. Instead, DIRNSA’s\naffidavit describes the entities that can be targeted pursuant to\nthis certification by giving examples of groups or persons that\npossess and/or are likely to communicate information\nconcerning one or more of the following activities: (1)\nproliferating weapons of mass destruction (WMD), to include\nnuclear, radiological biological or chemical weapons, their\ndeliver means, and related materials or technology by state or\nnon-state actors (2) operating supplier networks used by state\nand non-state actors to acquire WMD capabilities, delivery\nmeans or related materials or technology, (3) developing, selling\nor purchasing emerging and disruptive technologies that pose a\nthreat to the United States, its people or its allies, or (4)\ndeveloping selling or purchasing advanced conventional\nweapons that pose a threat to the United State, its people or its\nallies.\nThe examples that are included in the affidavit are not the only\ntypes of entities that may be targeted, but should be reviewed by\nanalysts who are interested in conducting targeting pursuant to\nthis certification. If a potential target falls clearly within one of\nthe descriptions, it is clearly suitable for tasking. However, the\nkey determinations are that the potential targets are reasonably\nbelieved to be non-US persons located outside the United States\nand that they possess and/or are likely to communicate\ninformation concerning the 4 categories of activities listed\nabove.\n\nTargeting Procedures (Exhibit A)\nThese procedures are the same as those for 2008-A.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n3.

Expanded NSA\ncapability to obtain\ntechnical and\nlinguistic assistance\n\nMinimization Procedures (Exhibit B)\nThese procedures differ in two relatively minor ways from the\nminimization procedures for 2008-A and 2008-B. Both of\nthese differences appear in section 8. First, they make it clear\nthat NSA may disseminate intelligence reports that contain\nproperly minimized US person information to foreign\ngovernments, and that any dissemination of US person\ninformation to a foreign government must be done in a manner\nconsistent with subsections 6(b) and 7 of the minimization\nprocedures…essentially the same rules that govern\ndissemination of US person information to other federal\nagencies. Because NSA always interpreted this portion of the\nminimization procedures in this manner, this “clarification”\nhas no meaningful practical consequences. Second, they\nexpand NSA’s capability to obtain technical and linguistic\nassistance from foreign governments beyond the Second\nParties. The conditions and limitations under which such\nassistance may be sought/provided remain unchanged, but as\nlong as they are met, NSA may obtain the assistance from\nother foreign governments as well.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\nFAA Certification 2009-A - Foreign Governments\n(Targeting Directed at Foreign Governments and Similar Entities)\nChanges from 2008-A:\nExhibit F is updated\n\nNew method to update\nExhibit F target list\n\nSome notifications are\nchanged from\n“7 days” to\n“5 business days”\n\nThis certification replaced certification 2008-A. The list of\ngovernments/entities in Exhibit F is slightly different from\nthat which was included in the 2008 version. As always, if\nan analyst wants to target a selector pursuant to this\ncertification, he should make sure that the targeting concerns\na listed entity. NSA may modify the list by notification to\nthe Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence\nwithin 5 business days of implementing collection directed at\nan entity that does not appear on the list, but that is not a\ndecision that can be made by an individual analyst.\nQuestions about modifying the list should be addressed to the\nOGC.\nThe only other somewhat significant difference between\n2008-A and 2009-A is a change in the calculation of some\nrequirements for notification. In 2008-A, NSA was required\nto notify the AG and DNI of additions to the list in Exhibit F\nwithin “7 days”. NSA was also required to inform DOJ and\nthe ODNI of certain incidents of noncompliance with the\ntargeting procedures as well as inadvertent targeting of\npersons located inside the US within “7 days.” All of these\nrequirements have been changed to “5 business days” in\n2009-A to ensure consistent calculation of the timeframes for\nnotification.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\nFAA Certification 2009-B - Counterterrorism\n(Targeting Directed at Foreign Terrorist Groups)\nChanges from 2008-B:\nExhibit F is updated\n\nNew method to update\nExhibit F target list\n\nSome notifications are\nchanged from\n“7 days” to\n“5 business days”\n\nThis certification replaced certification 2008-B.

NSA may modify the list\nby notification to the Attorney General and Director of\nNational Intelligence within 5 business days of\nimplementing collection directed at a group that does not\nappear on the list, but that is not a decision that can be made\nby an individual analyst. Questions about modifying the list\nshould be addressed to the OGC.\nThe only other somewhat significant difference between\n2008-B and 2009-B is a change in the calculation of some\nrequirements for notification which mirrors the change\nmade in 2009-A (discussed above).

One can almost hear a discernable\nbuzz of activity from the analysts of the ECC\nexecuting gueries, authoring fingerprints, and\nconsuming metadata garnered from XKEYSCORE (XKS), In the past three months,\nthe ECC has tripled, and even guadrupled in some cases, the number of gueries\nperformed, the number of items pushed to PIN WALE, and the number of sessions\nviewed. And these numbers continue to grow,*\n(S//REL) What has been the cause of this flurry of success? The ECC points to a\nrecent XKS training blitz in support of the Analytic Modernization\nOutreach\nCampaign to encourage discovery. In early March, ECC SIGDEV analysts held\nan XKS Circuit Training event designed to expose analysts to five, 20-minute\none-on-one sessions in a circuit-type environment. This \"speed dating\" for XKS\nconsisted of five stations covering topics titled \"Intro to the GUI and Basic\nQueries,\" \"Metadata Setup and Manipulation,\" \"Content and Manipulation of\nResults,\" \"Introduction to Fingerprints,\" and \"Introduction to Microplugins,\"\n(S//REL) Over four days, 68 students were walked through these topics with five\ndifferent instructors, able to ask specific guestions and get more comfortable with\nthe tool. \"Everyone likes a new toy, and there was a lot of excitement about it. The\nwill at least try it against their target and see what they will get out of it,\" said\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ o n e of the instructors and a SIGDEV Analyst embedded in Africa\nDivision,\n(S//SI//REL) With traditional targeting, analysts cast their nets wide into the murky\nwaters of network traffic and haul in anything that gets caught in the net. We are\nlike Forrest Gump on his shrimping boat off the coast of Alabama pulling in a boot,\ntoilet seat, seaweed, and there they are,., three shrimp! We burn up a lot of\nresources getting those shrimp, those reportable documents or metadata used to\nexpand target knowledge, and we deal with tons of toilet seats, the spam and other\njunk. Then, we repeat the same process and hopefully catch enough \"shrimp\" to\nhave ourselves a little cocktail, XKS has become so important because with it,\nanalysts can downsize their gigantic shrimping nets to tiny, handheld goldfish-sized\nnets and merely dip them into the oceans of data, working smarter and scooping\nout exactly what they want,\n(U//FOUO) And a short, two-hour class is an easy gamble of time for the hopes of\nbeing able to work smarter and more efficiently, ECC analysts have been trading in\ntheir old nets for new ones and are thrilled with their catches. Discovery can only\noccur if people are willing to try new things, and more of our analysts are getting\ncomfortable with leaping into the relatively unknown world of XKS.\n(U//FOUO) \"The first time I saw XKS, I said, \"Whoa!! It i^nrimidating because you\nopen it up and you see all these gueries and fields,\"\n\"We took the\nstudents from that response to being able to approach it and navigate around in it.\nThey see it differently now and know it's not a seven-headed dragon,\" This gentle\nintroduction has definitely enabled analysts to ease into XKS and get more\ncomfortable, and with that it has radically changed the overall mentality towards\n\n2 of 4\n\n\fthe tool.\n(S//REL) Across the ECCmml^sts wholeheartedly agree that the Circuit\nTraining setup and content was a catalyst to give XKS a try or take existing\nusers to the next level.

I used to always ask someone to look over my guery\nbefore I submitted it. Now, my hand doesn't need to be held.\"\n(S//REL) That Circuit Training must be one tough training to pull off, you say? Not\nso, says\nspoke about the \"off-the-shelf\" nature of the training. \"The\nframework was already developed by GCIIQ, so it was simple for us to read over\ntheir notes, make it applicable to NSA, and conduct the training. We didn't have to\nspend time writing modules.\"\n(TS//SI//REL) From the leadership level's perspective, the time invested sending\nanalysts to the class had a tremendous return.\nTech Lead for the\n50-person strong Africa Division, said, \"The brevity of the class made it easy to\nsend our people. Now we know exactly why we want to use it, and we have\ndiscovered new traffic and documents. Our analysts have been building hashes for\ndocument tracking and rolling them into fingerprints. We have been getting\ndocuments in XKS that we were not getting in our PIN WALE gueries. Just today\nanalysts found reportable material from the Tunisian Ministry of Interior that was\nnot from any selectors we were targeting. Now we know what we can do with XKS\nand exactly why we want to use it -- to make these discoveries.\"\n\n(S//REL) These discoveries are igniting a trend of using XKS on a daily basis. \"For\ndaily pulls, analysts go through TransX, PINWALE, and now XKS to see what's new\nfor the day, \" ^ ^ ^ H s a i d .\n(U//FOUO) Combine these exciting finds with the introduction of XKS Skilz points,\nand you can see why McDonald's teamed up with Monopoly years ago: people buy\nmore and even super size their orders just to get game pieces. With the brainchild\nof Skilz, where analysts can earn points and unlock achievements for performing\ntasks in XKS, people are willing to try new things within the tool. Analysts think to\nthemselves, \"Using the Pivot Data feature will earn 30 points... I'm going to try it\nand see what happens.\" Discovery! Points! We have been lured by our geeky desire\nto unlock achievements and earn points, and bragging rights are everything.\n(U//FOUO) \"Definitely a number of users have gotten into the Skilz points. We have\nseveral people at level six. They see what they need to do to earn more points and\nstart trying out different things,\" s a i d ^ ^ ^ H In fact, ECC analysts now have the\nhighest average of Skilz points compared to all of the S2 product lines and have\nwritten the most fingerprints per-capita! Some people say that the potent\ncombination of Skilz points, the Circuit Training, and the team of easily-accessible,\non-site instructors is the secret to ECC's successes with XKS.\n(U//FOUO) Maybe XKS is a seven-headed dragon as\nmentioned. Dig and\nscary? Sure. Strong and powerful? Oh yeah. But, the ECC is taming it, and it is ours\n3 of 4\n\n\fto do with whatever we like, including catching shrimp,\n(U//FOUO)\n\nECC SIGDEV\n\n* (S//REL) Here are charts to illustrate the point:\n\n4 of 4\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": "[editi News\nBREAKING NEWS (May 2012) - The second tranche of 'deep dive' processing capability at\nRPC has gone live. In addition 2 extra lOG's are being processed at OPC. This brings the current\n'deep dive capability to:\n• CPC with 16 x 1 Qg\n• OPC with 7 x 1 Og\n• RPC1 with 23 x lOg.\nThis gives over 300 GCHQ and —250 NSA analysts access to huge amounts of data to support the\ntarget discovery mission.\nThe MTI programme would like to say a big thanks to everyone who has made this possible\n(Which includes M l l ^ ^ H ' T G A . TEA. SSMC. SSOS. GTE, ACD, OPP-LEC. IT Services. R1 at\nE:\nNSA, AHS and ) - a true collaborative effort!\nTEMPO RA was delivered by the MTI Enhanced Discovery swimlane, led by\niart of the MTI SICINT Apps theme led by\n|PM) and\n\nr\n\n[editi TEMPORA\nTEMPQRA is an Internet Buffer capability being delivered by MTI, IPP and GTE For joint mission\nbenefit. It builds upon the key success of the TINT experiment and will provide a vital unique\n\n1 of 3\n\n\fcapability to MISD/MCE communities.\n• TEMPO HA is the codeword For GCHQs internet buffer business capability as a whole - which\nis the ability to loosely promote a % of traffic across GCHQs SSE access into a repository\nwhich will keep the content (and its associated metadata) for periods of time (approximately\n3 days for content and up to 30 days for metadata) to allow retrospective analysis and\nforwarding to follow on systems.\n• TEMPORA as a capability is agnostic of the technologies used to promote that traffic and to\nstore that traffic and so should not be used as a codeword for the individual components (e.g\nXKS, MVR etc).\n• At the moment the components include, amongst others, GCHQ SSH Access, POKERFACE\nsanitisation, XKS (in various configurations) and it will include MVR in the very near future.\n• TEMPORA also covers the management of the rules used to promote traffic into the internet\nbuffer capability.\n• TEMPORA is not processing centre specific. At the moment there are instances of\nTEMPORA at all xPC (Namely CPC, OPC and RPC1). These should be referred to, when\nrequired, as OPC/CPC/RPC1 TEMPORA\n\n[edit] A bit more detail\n\nTEMPORA are GCHQ's large-scale, Deep Dive deployments on Special Source access (SSE).\nDeep Dive XKeyscores work by promoting loose categories of traffic (e.g., all web, email, social,\nchat, EA, VPN, VoIP...) from the bearers feeding the system and block all the high-volume, low\nvalue traffic (e.g., P2P downloads). This usually equates to - 3 0 % of the traffic on the bearer. We\nkeep the full sessions for 3 working days and the metadata for 30 days for you to query, using all\nthe functionality that Keyscore offers to slice and dice the data. The aim is to put the best 7.5% of\nour access into TEMPORA's, comprising a mix of Deep Dive Keyscores and promotion of data\nbased on IP subnet or technology type from across the entire MVR. At the moment, users are\nable to access 46x1 OGs of data via existing Internet Buffers.. This is a lot of data! Not only that,\nbut the long-running TINT program and our initial 3-month operational trial of the CPC Internet\nBuffer (the first operational Internet Buffer to be deployed) show that every area of ops can get\nreal benefit from this capability, especially for target discovery and target development. Internet\nBuffers are different from TINT in that the latter is purely an experimental, research environment\nwhereas Internet Buffers can be used operationally for EPR. Effects, enabling CNE etc.\nFor a more detailed depiction of how TEMPORA and TINT differs please see here.\n\n[edit!

The JEA, an operational element of the Special UE Liaison\nActivity Germany is ajoint EIGINT development, collection, and\nexploitation site manned by German and US personnel.\n\nEND discussed their processing architecture, which is largely\nbased on NEA's old P25 and P26 GRANDMAETER prototypes. Their focus is\nprimarily e-mail processing, speci?cally EMTP e-mail. Epam ?lters are used to\nmanage large data volumes. Selected tra?ic is passed through an automated\nprivacy protection system, ensuring that cannot view German-protected\ntra?ic. Dn-site END then manually assess all selected tra?ic to determine\npotential intelligence value.\n\nIn conducting this evaluation, they do not prioritize the selected traf?c by\ntarget or keyword. Instead they focus on e-mails carrying attachments with the\ngoal to scan e-mails as quickly as possible to increase their throughput. E-mails\nthat are determined to be ofpotential intelligence value are then forwarded to END\nHQE for follow-on evaluation and reporting.\n\nNEA intelligence discussed NEA's EIGINT Development model,\nNEA's \"Hunt versus Gather\" philosophy, our multi-stage selection and ?ltering\nprocess, and the evolution processing systems from GRANDMAETER to\nWEALTHYELUETER and, in the future, TURMDIL. The END appeared especially\ninterested in the TURMDIL approach of scanning and making judgments at the\npacket level prior to any sessionising.\n\nIn summary, NBA and END use opposite selection and ?ltering\napproaches. Where NEA primarily relies on equipment for selection \nand analyst minimisation for privacy protection, the END relies on\nto manually scan tra?ic for selection, and then equipment to ?lter data for\nprivacy protection. Full use of current NEA DNI processing systems and analysis\nmethodologies at JEA will be key to influencing the END to alter their strategic DNI\nprocessing approach.\n\nNote: END Germany's Eundesnachrichtendienst [the Federal Intelligence\nService}\n\n \n\nThis article is reprinted from the Foreign A?hirs Digest, April edition.\n\nEof'j\n\n3of3\n\n",

In the past year, Germany displayed\nboth eagerness and self-sufficiency in transforming its SIGINT activities and assumed\ngreater risk in support of U.S. intelligence needs and efforts to improve information\nsharing within the German government, with coalition partners, and NSA. The BND\nsupports NSA's emerging counterterrorism (CT) intelligence relationship with the\nGerman domestic services, taking steps to strengthen its SIGINT Development (SIGDEV\n) capabilities to perform a key technical advisory and support role within Germany. Both\npa rtn e r i s h a v e a g r e e ^\nT.transnationalorganized\ncrime,\ncounter narcotics\nSpecial Interest Alien Smuggling (SIA), and U.S. and coalition support to Afghanistan\n(the Afghanistan SIGINT Coalition (AFSC)), In 2012, NSA welcomed BND President\nSellin dler's eagerness to strengthen and expand bilateralcooperat^\nnew analytic topics of mutual interest including\nand\nco u nter pro liferati on (C P) -r el ate d activ iti es. I r U. S. •-Germ an cy b er acti vity, N S A co nt in u es\nto encourage BND participation in foundational cyber defense discussions to\ndemonstrate its potential to provide a technical platform.\n(S//NF) Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense Relationship with\nGermany.\n(S//NF) The Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) has a long-standing relationship\nwith the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Infbrmationstechnik (ßSI) - the Federal Office\nof Information Security. After the German Government announced their Cybersecurity\nStrategy and identified BSI as the lead Agency for cyber defense, BSI expressed great\ninterest in expanding the information assurance (IA) partnership to include computer\nnetwork defense (CND) collaboration on cyber threats. Key Partners within the German\nGovernment along with BSI, are Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), Federal Office\nfor Protection of the Constitution and BND. While BfV and BND have not been traditional\nIA partners, the expansion to include CND will open additional opportunities to develop\nrelationships with the German agencies responsible for analysis and SIGINT. IAD and\nthe NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC) may be able to leverage the formal\npartnership the NSA Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) is pursuing with BfV and its\nalready strong relationship with BND (which is providing SIGINT Support to CND for\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 200701 OB\nDeclassify On: 20360301\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S1//N OF ORN\nGermany's cyber defense efforts.) A draft IA and CND Memorandum of Understanding\n(MOU) for CND collaboration is in the coordination process at NSA, BSI and BIMD will\nboth be signatories.\nl. (U) Key Issues:\n»\n\nIssue #1: (S//5I//NF) The BIMD has been working to influence the German\nGovernment to relax interpretation of the privacy laws over the long term to provide\ngreater opportunity for intelligence sharing. In the near term, NSA decided to rightsize its presence at the Joint SIGINT Activity (JSA) in Bad Aibling, Germany based\non current mission needs and fiscal realities. In May 2012 NSA turned over full\nresponsibility of the FORNSAT collection mission to the BND, allowing NSA's\nrepresentational team to cultivate new cooperative opportunities with Germany.\n\n•\n\nIssue #2: (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Chief, Special U.S. Liaison Activity Germany\n(SUSLAG), continues to work with DNI Representative Berlin on new CT initiatives\nbetween NSA and the BfV and with other German domestic agencies as appropriate.\nNSA has developed a significant level of trust and intelligence sharing with the BfV\nsince the 2007 arrests of the Islamic Jihad Union members in Germany which\nresulted in regular U.S.-German analytic exchanges and closer cooperation in\ntracking both German and non-German extremist targets. NSA also has held several\nmultilateral technical meetings with BND/BfV/NSA/CIA to introduce SIGDEV\nmethodology and tradecraftto improve the BfV's ability to exploit, filter, and process\ndomestic data accesses and potentially develop larger collection access points that\ncould benefit both Germany and the U.S. The BND supports NSA's emerging CT\nintelligence relationship with the BfV, taking steps to strengthen its SIGDEV\ncapabilities to perform a key technical advisory and support role within Germany. To\nfacilitate cooperation, an NSA CT analyst, stationed in Berlin, occupies office space\nin BfV headquarters one day per week to nurture the relationship and facilitate U.S.\nrequirements. Likewise, the Germans developed a communications link improving the\nconnectivity between NSA and BfV/BND, as well as the timeliness of the intelligence\nexchange.\n\n»\n\nIssue #3: (S//NF) NSA IAD, SID and NTOC are interested in leveraging Germany's\naccesses and capabilities to discover threats and vulnerabilities which provide timely\nwarnings of attacks against U.S. Government and critical infrastructure networks. In\nDecember 2012, representatives from NTOC and FAD met with BSI and BND in\nGermany for bilateral CND discussions. As a result of the engagement, an analytical\nexchange was held in January 2013,\n\n(U) Discussion:\n»\n\n(S//NF) NSA's in-country representative is the Chief, SUSLAG, located on Mangfall\nKaserne in Bad Aibling, Germany. SUSLAG has 18 personnel, consisting of 12 NSA\ncivilians and six contractors. NSA has plans to reduce the SUSLAG workforce to\napproximately six personnel in FY 2013,\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S1//N OF ORN\n•\n\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) What we provide to the partner: NSA has provided a\nsignificant amount of hardware and software at BND expense, as well as associated\nanalytic expertise to help the BIMD independently maintain its FORNSAT capability.\nNSA also exchanges intelligence reporting on both military and non-military targets.\n\n•\n\n(TS//SI//NF) WhatlhEiparlneLpiQMigsJous: NSA is provided access to FORNSAT\ncommunications supporting CN,\nand Weapons of Mass Destruction\n(WMD) missions and is an important source of information on drug trafficking and\nforce protection in Afghanistan. The BND provides I g bo language support by\ntranslating NSA collection of a high-value, t i m e - s e n s i t i v e ^ ^ ^ ^ J target. NSA is\nseeking the proper approvals to accept BND language support in\nIn addition to the day-to-day collection, the Germans have offered\nNSA unique accesses in high interest target areas.\n\n(U) Success stories:\n•\n\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Germany has become an active participant in the AFSC,\nworking closely with other member countries and embracing the new AFSC Division\nof Effort, under which each member country is responsible for covering a specific\narea of interest to the AFSC and then sharing reporting and metadata on that area\nwith the other AFSC members. AFSC member countries include: the U S, UK,\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,\nNorway, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.\n\n•\n\n( TS//SI // R EL TO U S A, F VE Y) H a vi n g modernized its communications in ft astru ctu re\nin support of its unique FORNSAT GSM access in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ h e BND\nbecame the third largest contributor to the Real Time-Regional Gateway (RT-RG)\nanalysis and processing tool,\n\n•\n\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The German government modified its interpretation of the\nG-10 Privacy Law, protecting the communications of German citizens, to afford the\nBND more flexibility in sharing protected information with foreign partners.\n\n•\n\n(S//SI//RELTO USA, FVEY) The BND has provided unique sustained colleç^n of\ntargets such a s ^ ^ ^ ^ V l i n i s t r y of Foreign Affairs ( M F A ^ ^ ^ ^ H ^ A , ^ ^ ^ !

The BND's inability to\nsuccessfully address German privacy law (G-10) issues has limited some operations,\nbut NSA welcomed German willingness to take risks and to pursue new opportunities\nfor cooperation with the U S, particularly in the CT realm.

Note that we had wanted to simply include these Opening Remarks\nTalking Points in our Exec Sum for the visit, but DIR Staff told us they needed a\nseparate document for the Opening Remarks and it needed to be in a specific\nformat. That format is below (example provided is from DENUSA last year).\n\nThe Remarks should outline things that have been accomplished since the last\nconference, as well as things we want to get accomplished in this\nconference/the upcoming year. We should also add anything else FAD wants\nDIRNSA to convey.\n\nOnce the Opening Remarks Talking Points are approved by appropriate DP1\nleadership (at least DP1 Office Chief level), the CD0 should provide the Opening\nRemarks in the attached format to the following aliases at least 3 business days\nin advance of the event:\n\nTO: DL DIRSPEAK\n\nCC: DIR Staff, DP1 Office Chief/Deputy\n\nPer guidance from DIR Staff, it is the responsibility of the folks on the\nDIRCOMMS alias to print out the remarks on 5X8 cards and provide to\nthe DIR staff.\n\n(Updated on 3/4/2013)\n\nTOP USA, DNK\n\nTO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\nDENUSA\n6-8 June\n\nTO USA, DNK) Thank the Danes for their\nwonderful hospitality they extended to you and your\ndelegation during your March visit to Copenhagen.\n\nTO USA, DNK) -\n\nTO USA, DNK)\n\n \n\nTO USA, DNK) Emphasize \ncommitment to the special access and assisting DDIS in\nmanaging the access.\n\nRemind the Danes of the long NSA-DDIS partnership\nworking cable access with.\n\nNote that we look forward to new areas of\ncooperation.\n\nTO USA, DNK) Highlight that NSA is willing to\nengage with DDIS on cyber defense.\n\nTO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\nTOP USA, DNK\nWe believe that furthering our cooperation will be\nmutually beneficial to our two nations.\n\nTO USA, \n\nTO USA, DNK) Stress that Denmark is a very\ntrusted, capable party.\n\n \n \n\nWe value that partnership and we are pleased to be\nmoving forward with DDIS on critical target areas.\n\nWe believe that furthering our cooperation will be\nmutually beneficial to our two nations.\n\nTOP TO USA, DNK\n\n",

By mid-2011 a new version of XKS should have been\ndeployed where individual microplugins will still be deployed lo every XKS, but they can be\ntagged not to run on certain XKS. The only exception is where you deploy a mic to plug in only to\nGTE's XKS fleet: these will not be visible to 2P partners.\n\n[edit] Types of XKEYSCORE\nThere are currently three different types of XKS:\n* Traditional\n* Stage 2\n* D e e p Dive\nThey differ principally on where in the processing chain they sit. whether the data they receive\nhas already been sessionised or not and whether they ingest all of the data they receive or\nwhether they apply rules to only ingest some data.\n[editl\n\nTraditional\n\nWhen XKS was first developed it was used to receive data from low data rate signals being\nprocessed through WEALTHYCLUSTER (WC). W C session ised all the data on the link and\npresented it all to XKS. All data was ingested into XKS.\nGCHQ has traditional XKS a t many of our sites, including all of our Comsat, Terrestrial and SMO\nsites. The EREPO XKS is also a traditional XKS, though in that case data has been softly selected\nat the implant and sessionisation takes place in TERRAIN, rather than WC.\nfeditl\n\nStage\n\n\nFor higher data rates, a \"Stage 2\" XKS was developed to ingest data from TURMOIL. TURMOIL\npasses 5% of the packets to XKS which XKS then sessionizes. TURMOIL decides which 5% of\npackets to pass based on the following criteria:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nstrong selection\nsubnet promotion\ntechnology promotion\ne-mail domains\npersona session promotion (where if a strong selector is seen, 10 minutes' or 10 MB of data\nis collected)\n* persona session collection (where the data is collected and forwarded to N S A s PIN WALE\nbut is also passed to the XKS)\nThis data is then sent lo the Stage 2 XKS. All other data is lost.\nOnly J PC (MUSCULAR) at GCHQ uses a Stage 2 XKS.\n[edit] D e e p\n\nDive\n\nDeep Dive XKS was developed to prove that sessionisation at 10G data rates was possible. First it\nsessionises all data on a link. Then it promotes data using the GENESIS selection language to\nidentify data types where we assess there is potential intelligence value and ingests those. The\npromotion process can make one of three decisions:\n* Block data that is legally not allowed to be in the system - ie UK-UK traffic\n• Allow data that is known to be wanted through use of promotion rules\n* And then to drop any data that doesn't meet either of these\nOne of the experiments in TINT is seeking to identify where the best balance lies between what\nis kept and what is not. A factor in deciding how much data to keep is the scale of storage\ncapacity that can be provided.\nGCHQ already operates a number of Deep Dive XKS:\n\n2 of 4\n\n\f\f",

When first detected, the video was unencrypted. The\nvideo therH>ecame encrypted over a period of two months. The current demodulation\nsolution from the TEC is called BOTANICREALTY. Originally, SALTYDOGS was used\nto find carrier acquisitions and discover signal characteristics. This provided the\nfrequency range, carrier rates, and a rough time up and time down for channel activity.\n(TS//SI//REL) In mid-April, the TEC installed BOTANICREALTY (formerly known as\nUNCANNY) at LADYLOVE in the hopes of locating, identifying, and collecting |\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ H c l e a r and encrypted video signals found on the]\ncollection of these signals, in support o f ~\nis\nthe\nvarious\nspecial projects at the CIA, and in general product reporting\n(TS//SI//REL) Within minutes of the system coming on line, BOTANICREALTY\nsuccessfully collected its first signal matching the parameters of the encrypted (HIGH\nPRIDE) v i d e o T h e hub control channels are session encrypted while the\noutstations are bulk encrypted video. Since proving the ability to automatically process\nthese signals of interest at LADYLOVE, over 1000 collects, totaling hundreds of hours\nof raw data, have been made and forwarded to cryptanalytic personnel in CES for\nfurther investigation.\n\n(U//FOUO) Joint SIGINT Activity Annual Report for 2007\n\n(S//SI//REL) The Joint SIGINT Activity (J SA) experienced notable successes in its\nFORNSAT mission during 2007 for NSA and the German Federal Intelligence Service,\nor Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). However, concurrent with the JSA mission\nchanges, manpower requirements were re-evaluated and reductions to both civilian and\ncontractor manning levels were approved with implementation to be carried out in FY08.\n(S//SI//REL) The past year also saw an expansion of JSA's partnerships with SSO,\nTOPIs, and ESOC, with plans to expand these further and increase support on various\noperations in 2008. JSA will continue to build on its successes and improve its mission\ncontribution in collection and SIGINT development to both NSA and BND.\n\nTOP SECRET/ / CO MINT/ / REL TO U SA( FVEY\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET// COMIMT// REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n(U//FOUO) Highlights for 2007:\n(S//SI//REL) JSA engineers developed various analysis tools and an automated selector\nsanitizing tool. The selector sanitization tool can be used at other sites, including those\nworking special projects.\n(S//SI//REL) The expansion of site capabilities through the installation and integration of\nU.S. and German systems significantly improved collection and development of highpriority targets. New or improved capabilities include an automated survey system, VoIP\nprocessing and metadata collection capabilities, a high speed filtering system, GSM\nmetadata collection capabilities, and new data flows to NSA for DNI, VoIP and GSM\nmetadata.\n(S//SI//REL) A closer relationship between ESOC, JSA and BND resulted in new\nexploitation of targets in Algeria as well as other African targets. New TROPICPUMA\nfax processing capabilities deployed in December immediately began to provide unique\nand valuable intelligence to ESOC and BND on |\n(S//SI//REL) The BND used JSA\n\nGSM collection to identify, track, alert, and\n\nJSA continues to provide critical collection of the|\nnetwork, providing unique insights into\n\n(S//SI//REL) NSA personnel continued to improve BND's skills through both classroom\nand on-the-job training allowing BND personnel to take on greater roles in DNI\nprocessingandanalysis.\n\n(S//SI//REL) Joint SIGINT Activity-Developed VoiPSum and AutoNorm Tools Used\nin Local Analysis, Create Agency-wide Interest\n\n(S//SI//REL) JSA has developed and is now using two new number normalization tools\n- a VoIP Summarization (VoiPSum) tool and an Automated Normalization (AutoNorm)\ntool.\n(S//SI//REL) Voice-over-IP (VoIP) traffic is prevalent at many collection sites, including\nJSA. Site engineers have developed a simple tool, called VoiPSum, to extract, parse,\nand organize VoIP metadata for analysis by Intelligence Analysts, Signals Analysts, and\ndevelopers. VoiPSum provides the user with several outputs: a summary file of\ncities/countries on each case notation seen in its run, also viewable by web browser; a\nTOP SECRET/ / CO MINT/ / REL TO U SA( FVEY\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET// COMIMT// REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nfile containing URIs (Uniform Resource Indicators) and their associated IP addresses; a\nfile of normalized numbers and location information; and a file of normalization\nsuggestions for non-normalized numbers, generated with help from AutoNorm.\n(S//SI//REL) Generating normalization rules for NORMALRUN can be very difficult\nwithout adequate knowledge of a region's Country Code (CC), National Destination\nCode (IMDC), Local Exchange Office Code (LEOC), and Subscriber Number (SN). JSA\nhas found their in-house developed tool, AutoNorm, a great time saver for generating\nNORMALRUN rules. AutoNorm works by matching substring combinations of the raw\nnumber against the Global Numbering Database flat file. It provides several input\noptions: generic, which tries to find an exact match; pre list, which appends a given set\nof digits to domestic calls before attempting matches; and sort, which sorts its output\ninto groups that share the same digits stripped or pre-pended,\n(S//SI//REL) These two tools have been used by JSA analysts to aid in generating\nreports and number normalizations and target research. Additionally, representatives\nfrom the NAC, Misawa, SSG, S2C, and SSO have expressed interest in receiving and\nusing VoIP Sum and AutoNorm.\n(S//SI//REL) VolPSum and AutoNorm are now available for download! For more\ninformation, including user manuals, output examples, and a downloadable tarball,\nplease visit JSA's website. You may also contact the POCs listed above.\n\n(S//SI//REL) Joint SIGINT Activity Begins New SMS and Call Event Dataflows for\nNSA Analysts\n\n(S//SI//REL) JSA initiated two new SMS dataflows for NSA analysts in April. These new\ndataflows are from USD-1079's AST128B and AST128C DNR collection platforms. The\nSMS data is flowing into DISHFIRE, and the corresponding call event data into FASCIA.\nA cursory\nshowed\nPoland and others. Preliminary data shows that JSA is sending over 330,000 SMS\nevents to DISHFIRE daily. So, let the hunt begin! One can isolate this new SMS data by\nquerying in DISHFIRE on JSA's PDDG (IQ) and collection box (RA, LI), This SMS\ncollection is being processed on multiple case notations from INTELSAT-902 (G2),\nYAMAL-202 (E9), and EUTELSAT-W6 (KL) with forward and reverse gateways with\n(primarily). However, we also have Tajikistan, Russia, Monaco, Lebanon\nand UAE gateways represented.

The special access program intercepts high-capacity international fiber-optic cables that transit at major congestion points around the world through general agreements with foreign partners. The program has many divisions to make the data collection as efficient as possible, resulting in collected data passing through multiple sites such as foreign processing centers. This program allows the NSA to collect automated, continuous, high-speed survey of circuit and packet switch traffic, dial number recognition of circuit-switched telephony, international voice and fax telephony, email, chat, VoIP, and calling card user data.",

    "doc_text": "(C//REL) TEMPORA -- \"The World's Largest XKEYSCORE\" -- Is Now\nAvailable to Qualified NSA Users\nFROM: (U//FOUO)\nNSA Integree at G'CHO\nRun Date: 09/19/2012\n(U//FOUO) SIGINT analysts: We have all heard about Dig Data; now you can get\nBig Access to Dig Data,\n1 of 4\n\n\f(TS//SI//REL) What happens when one site contains more data than all other\nXKEYSCOREs combined? At more than 10 times larger than the next biggest\nXKEYSCORE,* TEMPORA at GCHO is the world's largest XKEYSCORE and the\nNSA workforce is now getting greater access to it. This massive site uses over 1000\nmachines to process and make available to analysts more than 40 billion pieces of\ncontent a day. And starting today skilled NSA XKEYSCORE users can get access to\nthe TEMPORA database via the XKS-Central interface,\n(TS//SI//REL) What is TEMPORA? TEMPORA is GCIIQ's XKEYSCORE \"Internet\nbuffer\" which exploits the most valuable Internet links available to GCIIQ.\nTEMPORA provides a powerful discovery capability against Middle East, North\nAfrican and European target sets (among others). Analysts who have benefited\nfrom GCIIQ Special Source accesses like INCENSER or MUSCULAR will almost\ncertainly benefit from TEMPORA.\n(TS//SI//REL) How valuable is TEMPORA? The value and utility of TEMPORA\nwere proven early into a 5-month evaluation that began this past March, With a\nlimited user base of 300 analysts, TEMPORA became the second most valuable\nXKEYSCORE access for discovery. Additionally this small group of analysts\nproduced over 200 end-product reports and provided critical support to SIGINT\ndefensive, and cyber mission elements,\n(TS//SI//REL) Why TEMPORA? TEMPORA provides the ability to do content-based\ndiscovery and development across a large array of high-priority signals. Similar to\nother XKEYSCORE deployments, TEMPORA effectively \"slows down\" a large chunk\nof Internet data, providing analysts with three working days to use the surgical\ntoolkit of the GENESIS language to discover data that otherwise would have been\nmissed. This tradecraft of content-based discovery using the GENESIS language\nis a critical tool in the analyst's discovery tool kit, and nicely complements the\nexisting and well-known tradecrafts of strong selection targeting and bulk\nmeta-data analysis,\n(TS//SI//REL) How do I get an account? To comply with GCHQ policy and to\nensure users are successful in such a large-scale environment, TEMPORA access\nreguires users to be proficient with XKEYSCORE, At NSA this is achieved via the\ncompletion of various XKS Skilz achievements. Beginning today, users will see a\nnew \"TEMPORA\" achievement, which reguires users to have remained current with\ntheir UK Legalities training (OVSCI700), be a level 3 or higher XKS Skilz user, and\nhave used GENESIS by either guerying or authoring fingerprints. Users who meet\nthose criteria will automatically be given TEMPORA access in their XKS Central\naccount.\n(S//SI//REL) What do I need to know about using TEMPORA? Although\nTEMPORA will appear as an additional database in XKS Central, there are some\nimportant items analysts need to be aware of when they search this database.\nAnalysts are asked to pay close attention to details concerning the UK Legality\nreguirements on the TEMPORA user-guidance wiki page, TEMPORA gueries must\ncomply with both UK and U.S. legal reguirements, and the analytic community\nmust ensure we are using this access wisely and compliantly.\n2 of 4\n\n\f(S//SI//REL) How can I learn more about using XKEYSCO RE? If you'd like to\nget TEMPORA access but need some help fulfilling the proficiency requirements,\nthe XKEYSCORE Outreach Team is ready to help. The team recently added an\nadditional round of XKEYSCORE training sessions on ERS, which users can sign up\nfor via this link. Also, analysts can find great tradecraft and training tips via the\nXKEYBLOG, or they can contact the team directly at DL XKS Mentoring,\n(U//FOUO) For more information \"go TEMPORA\" or contact\n(U) Notes:\n* (S//SI/REL) XKEYSCORE is a computer-network exploitation system that\ncombines high-speed filtering with SIGDEV XKEYSCORE performs filtering and\nselection to enable analysts to quickly find information they need based on what\nthey already know, but it also performs SIGDEV functions such as target\ndevelopment to allow analysts to discover new sources of information.\n\n3 of 4\n\n\f4 of 4\n\n\f",

TEMPORA allows analysts to gain \"big access to big data\" by slowing-down Internet data, allowing analysts three days to exploit the most valuable Internet links available in GCHQ for content-based discovery and metadata analysis. With over 1000 machines to process more than 40 billion pieces of content a day, TEMPORA is set to outshine NSA's outdated XKEYSCORE program, which could not sift through bulk data as efficiently. The new program purports to comply with U.K. and U.S. legal requirements while targeting Middle East, North African, and European target sets (among others).",

These visits in June and July provided\ninsights into the DND's collection, processing, and analytic capabilities, and\npromoted the close technical partnership between JSA and the DND.\n(S//SI//REL) Before the reunification of Germany, Schdningen (located on the\nformer East-West German border) collected East German radar, radio, and\nmicrowave communications. When Germany reunified in 1990, DND personnel at\nSchdningen were forced to recreate their role and mission.. Schdningen did so\nproudly, and now plays a key role in the DND's Counterterrorism (CT) and Force\nProtection efforts by collecting mobile communication systems (specifically\nThuraya. INMARSAT, and GSM),\n(S//SI//REL) Today, Schdningen is manned with approximately 100 personnel. There\n\n(S//SI//REL) Schdningen personnel focus on development and production of voice\nand facsimile traffic collected from Thuraya, INMARSAT and GSM. Schdningen\ncollects over 4 0 0 , 0 0 ( ^ h u r a y ^ u t ^ e ] ^ i a ^\ncuts from\nnetwork. E-mail is also collected at site, with an average of 62,000 collects per day,\nNS^benefits from this collection, especially the Thuraya intercepts from\nwhich the DND shares on a daily basis,\n(S//SI//REL) Site analysts and linguists are responsible for evaluating collected\ntraffic, transcribing voice cuts and forwarding raw cuts on to their HQS for further\nevaluation and reporting. To improve their collection and SIGDEV capabilities, site\nengineers have developed several systems to improve DND call-chaining\ncapabilities, data-viewing of voice and fax data, and data-forwarding to DND HQS.\nDevelopment efforts at a field site are unusual for DND, and it was interesting to\nlearn about these on-site efforts.\n(S//SI//REL) The second visit by JSA and NSA Headguarters analysts represented\nthe first technical exchange with DND Schdningen, US analysts were shown several\nDND analytic tool suites, some of which were under development, DND contract\n2 of 4\n\n\fsoftware developers and analysts sought regular feedback on the utility of these\ntools and techniques. These tool suites, such as MIRA 4, Integrate multiple\ndatabase analytic functions (such as viewing voice and listening to fax), much like\nNSA Headquarters has UIS (User Integrated Services), In some ways, these tools\nhave features that surpass US SIGINT capabilities. Among a series of interesting\nitems, NSA analysts noted that DND analysts could seamlessly move from VERAS\n(call-chaining software) to the associated voice cuts. DND Schoningen also\nperformed geolocational selection of mobile communicants. For instance, they\ncould define any particular geographical area, like\nand select any\ncommunicant that dwelled in that area for several minutes.\n(S//SI//REL) DND Schoningen developers also demonstrated a software prototype\nthat uses Social Network Analysis algorithms against metadata to discover and\nassess target groups among other things, looking for information flow. The goal (at\nleast in part) was to monitor these targets in the background within anaiyst-set\nparameters, with alerts to notify the analyst when any anomalous measurement\nappeared, and potentially to steer front-end collection. They claimed to have some\nsuccesses on small groups on which they had good collection,\n(S//SI//REL) They seemed interested in also characterizing movement patterns on\ngeocoordinates to find persons such as couriers (terrorist or otherwise), then using\nthat characterization for SIGDEV discovery purposes and predictive (trend)\nanalysis. DND also showed us that they are interested not only in selection based\non movement patterns or network structures, but also in hardware changes. They\nused a variety of algorithms (such as fuzzy logic) to discover these patterns. The\nDND responded positively to NSA's request for a copy of MIRA4 and VERAS\nsoftware, and made several requests from NSA concerninq tarqet and tool\ndevelopment and data,\n(S//SI//REL) This first series of meetinqs represents a new level of enqaqement for\nNSA and its German partner. We hope that this dialoque continues, and makes each\npartner more capable of satisfying common SIGINT requirements.\n(U) Notes:\n* DND = Federal Intelliqence Service\n(U//FOUO) This article is reprinted from the Foreign Affairs Digest September\nedition.\n\n3 of 4\n\n\f4 of 4\n\n\f",

What data is missing?\n6) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?\n7) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?\n8) What is the technical architecture for the tool?\n9) What are some upcoming features/enhancements?\n10)How are new features or views requested and prioritized?\n11) Why are record counts different from other tools like ASDF and What's On Cover?\n12)Why is the tool NOFORN? Is there a releasable version?\n13)How do you compile your record counts for each country?\n\nNote: This document is a work-in-progress\nquestions and guidance are provided.\n\nand will be updated frequently as additional\n\n1) (U) What is BOUNDLESSINFORMANT?\n\nWhat is its purpose?\n\n(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT is a GAO prototype tool for a self-documenting SIGINT\nsystem. The purpose of the tool is to fundamentally shift the manner in which GAO describes its\ncollection posture. BOUNDLESSINFORMANT provides the ability to dynamically describe GAO's\ncollection capabilities (through metadata record counts) with no human intervention and graphically\ndisplay the information in a map view, bar chart, or simple table. Prior to\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT, the method for understanding the collection capabilities of GAO's\nassets involved ad hoc surveying of repositories, sites, developers, and/or programs and offices. By\nextracting information from every DNI and DNR metadata record, the tool is able to create a near realtime snapshot of GAO's collection capability at any given moment. The tool allows users to select a\ncountry on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collection against that\ncountry. The tool also allows users to view high level metrics by organization and then drill down to a\nmore actionable level - down to the program and cover term.\nSample Use Cases\n(U//FOUO) How many records are collected for an organizational unit (e.g. FORNSAT)?\n(U//FOUO) How many records (and what type) are collected against a particular country?\n(U//FOUO) Are there any visible trends for the collection?\n(U//FOUO) What assets collect against a specific country? What type of collection?\n(U//FOUO) What is the field of view for a specific site? What countriees does it collect\nagainst? What type of collection?\n\n2) (U) Who are the intended users of the tool?\n(U//FOUO) Mission and collection managers seeking to understand output characteristics\nof a site based on what is being ingested into downstream repositories.\n\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - FAQ\nPage --1-3\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\n(U//FOUO) Strategic Managers seeking to understand top level metrics at the\norganization/office level or seeking to answer data calls on NSA collection capability.\n(U//FOUO) Analysts looking for additional sites to task for coverage of a particular\ntechnology within a specific country.\n\nWhat are the different views?\n(U//FOUO) Map View - The Map View is designed to allow users to view overall DNI, DNR, or\naggregated collection posture of the agency or a site. Clicking on a country will show the collection\nposture (record counts, type of collection, and contributing SIGADs or sites) against that particular\ncountry in addition to providing a graphical display of record count trends. In order to bin the records\ninto a country, a normalized phone number (DNR) or an administrative region atom (DNI) must be\npopulated within the record. Clicking on a site (within the Site Specific view) will show the viewshed\nfor that site - what countries the site collects against.\n(U//FOUO) Org View - The Organization View is designed to allow users to view the metadata record\ncounts by organizational structure (i.e. GAO - SSO - R A M - A - SPINNERET) all the way down to the\ncover term. Since it's not necessary to have a normalized number or administrative region populated,\nthe numbers in the Org View will be higher than the numbers in the Map View.\n(U//FOUO) Similarity View - The Similarity View is currently a placeholder view for an upcoming\nfeature that will graphically display sites that are similar in nature. This can be used to identify areas\nfor a de-duplication effort or to inform analysts of additional SIGADs to task for queries (similar to\nAmazon's \"if you like this item, you'll also like these\" feature).\n\n(U) Where do you get your data?\n(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT extracts metadata records from GM-PLACE postFALLOUT (DNI ingest processor) and post-TUSKATTIRE (DNR ingest processor). The records are\nenriched with organization information (e.g. SSO, FORNSAT) and cover term. Every valid DNI and\nDNR metadata record is aggregated to provide a count at the appropriate level. See the different views\nquestion above for additional information.\n\n(U) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?\n(U//FOUO) The tool resides on GM-PLACE which is only accredited up to\nTS//SI//NOFORN. Therefore, the tool does not contain ECI or FISA data.\n(U//FOUO) The Map View only shows counts for records with a valid normalized number\n(DNR) or administrative region atom (DNI).\n(U//FOUO) Only metadata records that are sent back to NSA-W through FASCIA or\nFALLOUT are counted. Therefore, programs with a distributed data distribution system (e.g.\nMUSCULAR and Terrestrial RF) are not currently counted.\n(U//FOUO) Only SIGINT records are currently counted. There are no ELINT or other \"INT\"\nrecords included.\n\n(U) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?\n(U//FOUO)\n\n(U) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?\n(U//FOUO) The tool currently makes no distinction between sustained collect and survey collect. This\nfeature is on the roadmap.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\n\fUJNCLASS1F1ED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nBOUNDLESS1NFORMANT - Frequently Asked Questions\n09-06-2012\n\n8) What ¡s the technical architecture for the too 17\n*\n\nC l i c k ^ H f o r a graphical view of the tool's architecture\n\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) DNl metadata (ASDF), DNR metadata (FASCIA) delivered to Hadoop\nDi stri bu led File System (HDFS) on CJM-PLACE\n( U/'/F OU O) U se Java Map Red uce job to Lransform/fi Ite r and enrich FASCIA/AS DF data wi th\nbusiness logic to assign organization mles Lodata\n\n*\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) Bulk import of DNI/DNR data (serialized Google Protobuf objects) Into\nClloudbase {enabled by custom aggregators)\n\n*\n\n(U/'/F CU O) U se Java w eb app (hosted via Tornea t) on Mach i neS bop ( formerly Tu tkey To wer)\nto query Cloud base\n\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) CUI triggers queries to Cloud Base - C XT (ExtCWT)\n\n9) What are some upcoming features/enhancements?\n*\n\n(U/7FOUO) Add technology type (e.g. JUCCERNAUT, LOPER) to provide additional\ngranularity in the numbers\n\n*\n\n(U//F OU O) Add add i tional detai I s to the Di fferen tial view\n\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) Refine the Site S p e d f i ; view\n\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) Include CASN information\n\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) Add ability to export data behind any view (pdd g, sigad,sy sid ,ca sn ,tec h,cou nt)\n\n*\n\n(U/7FOUO) Add in selected (vs. unselected) data indicators\n\n*\n\n(U//FOUO) Include filter for sustained vetsussu rvey co I lection\n\n10) How are new features or views requested and prioritized?\n(U//FOUO) The team u s e s ^ ^ ^ ^ l to accept user requests for additional functionality or\nenhancements.

Not too\nsurprisingly,, the station was a key target of Allied bombing. On December 20, 2005,\nduring survey activities of the area for installation of an underground fiber optic\nline, metallic anomalies were discovered and these were suspected of being\nunexploded ordnance, since such items had been discovered previously\n(U//FOUO) Operating with the following guiding principles, ETC and NSAW\npersonnel began contingency planning to ensure that critical ETC functions would\ncontinue in the event of an explosion,\n* To protect human life,\n* To protect business eguities in a prudent manner,\n* To keep as much of the business running as possible, and\n* To put in place contingency measures for personnel, cryptologic eguipment,\nand communication links,\n(U//FOUO) By 12 January 2006, it had been determined that the risk of an\nuncontrolled explosion was low and that the distance from the closest anomaly to\nETC buildings was outside the restricted zone as reguired by German law.\nHowever, to ensure safety, the entire base was to be closed to all personnel on\n24 and 25 January. Based on briefings provided by ETC to the Provost Marshall,\nETC was permitted to man the Network Communication Center with two critical\nstaff members,\n(S//SI) ETC and NSAW personnel worked to mitigate the risk by setting up an\nalternate communications facility at Mainz Finthen, Unfortunately only six of the\ncircuits passing through ETC from the Top 100 Circuits list could be accommodated\nby the alternate link and none of those was a foreign partner link, (All were directly\nsupporting efforts in Irag and Afghanistan,) A message was sent to the appropriate\nSLOs (SIGINT Liaison Officers) to notify the partners of the potential impact, but\nalso to assure them that the chance of disruption was small,\n(C) Excavation was initiated on 24 January, The four anomalies were dug up and no\nordnance was found. Three of the four holes contained miscellaneous metallic\ndebris and the fourth contained I-beams that supported an underground storage\narea or tunnel in the original WWII facility.

Intelligence generated by this Forward Production-NSAW partnership\nhas been responsible for the capture or kill of over 4 0 terrorists and has helped\nachieve GWOT and regional policy successes in Africa,\n(S//SI) While based on the skills of the forward-deployed analysts as supported by\nNSA HQ, two other overarching factors contributed to the effort's success. These\nfactors are;\n* collocation with the primary regional implementer or action arm of the US\nGovernment as well as supporting elements, and\n* an aggressive effort to release SIGINTto foreign governments supporting\ntruly non-traditional customers (e,g., governments in Algeria, Mali, and\nMauritania),\n(S//SI) Forward Production's effectiveness is based on collocation and integration\nwith operational planners and teaming with all-source customers and partners.\nThis allows Forward Production analysts to better anticipate reguirements, to\nprovide better-tailored products and services, to better operate in the customers'\ndecision cycle, and to better understand customer needs.\n(S//SI) As the title of DIRgram-337 states \"It's About Relating, Not Disseminating\"\nand NCEUR forward-deployed analysts as \"our expeditionary force inside our\ncustomers' information space,..\" are better enabling CT operations and reaching\nanalytic conclusions not otherwise possible. The Forward Production cell at NCEUR\nis serving as a model for operational partnering and analytic collaboration within\nthe customer's environment,\n(S//SI) This Forward Production model will be implemented on an industrial scale\nwhen the European Security Center (ESC) in Darmstadt, Germany, becomes fully\noperational. The ESC is the realization of a significant investment by US Army\nEurope (USAREUR) and Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) to perform\nSIGINT analysis and production against national, theater, and tactical reguirements\nwithin the customer domain, (See related story.)\nNotes:\n* (S//SI) Extended enterprise and HQ communities of the GEO, CT, Regional\nTargets, and Middle East North Africa product lines collaborated on this target.\n2 of 3\n\n\f\f",

In early January I joined a\nSID team on a trip to Germany to qain insiqht into the operations there and to\n\n1 of 4\n\n\fupdate the NSA/CSS Europe workforce on Agency, SID and S2 initiatives. Our team\nconsisted of:\nSID Chief o!\" Staff;\nSID CoS Executive Assistant;\nDeputy Technical Director;\nDAP Executive Assistant; and\nA/DDAP and Senior Intelligence Authority),\n(U//FOUO) We visited elements of the European Command (EUCOM) headquarters\nand NSA/CSS Europe (NCEUR) near Stuttgart, Germany; the European Security\nCenter (ESC) in Darmstadt; and the European Technical Cent\nWiesbaden, (See a m a p of NCFUR locations.^ Chief, NCEUR,[\naccompanied us throughout,\nStuttgart: European C o m m a n d HQ and NSA7CSS Europe (U//FOUO)\n(U//FOUO) We arrived in Stuttgart on Monday, 9 January, To stave off the jet lag,\nwe walked around downtown Stuttgart until meeting up with a group of NCEUR\nfolks for a dinner of good German food.\n(C) On Tuesday morning we w e r e t r e a t e d to several briefings on EUCOM and\nN C E U R ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a n d met with the EUCOM J3 (Director of Operations), Rear\nA d m i r a l ^ ^ ^ ^ p n d EUCOM J2 (Director of Intelligence), Brigadier General\ncoming away with a b e t t e r understanding of their perspectives. We used the\nopportunity to explain to t h e m how NSA's distributed analytic enterprise can be\nengaged in efforts to meet their information needs,\n(U//FOUO) Our session with the J3 was very positive and he appreciated the value\nof analysis. Rear Admiral\nfeels strongly t h a t intelligence sharing n e e d s a\nsystematic approach to enable transparency. He recognizes t h a t we are integrated\nand connected and therefore can't afford to operate independently,\n(U//FOUO) We next met with the J2, DG\nJAC (EUCOM'S Joint Analysis\nCenter in Molesworth, England) joined us virtually, giving us the chance to hear\ntheir concerns. We discussed the Mission Build-out, governance, resource\nchallenges and mission m a n a g e m e n t of a distributed enterprise, A key a r e a of\nconcern is \"less commonly taught languages\" and w h a t we're doing to meet t h a t\nchallenge. We made sure they knew t h a t A&P is at the forefront by leveraging\nlanguage resources in Utah (see a related message), the National Virtual\nTranslation Center (NVTC), and our 2nd party partners. We intend to leverage\nthose opportunities enterprise-wide. We also discussed the new \"lane structure\"\nand the Strategic Mission List, BG\ninterested in results from an all-source\nperspective and asked t h a t we keep our capabilities relevant to EUCOM. He w a s\nglad we w e r e there and hoped we would gain an appreciation of their ops during\nthe rest of our visit,\n(U//FOUO) We also held a town meeting with NCEUR personnel to cover current\nevents relating to resources and the structure of the Agency, as well as strategic\nplanning initiatives. Major points included;\n* Future t r e n d s and challenges in A & P\n* Future roles for the extended enterprise in A & P\n2 of 4\n\n\f* Changes in IT infrastructure due to new tools and techniques\n* S2 Assessment Cell\n* Senior Intelligence Authority issues\n(U//FOUO) We need to ensure we take advantage of their forward presence. As a\nforward-deployed function they are empowered leaders and strategists. We need to\nkeep doing forward what's best done forward! Following a busy and productive day\nwe went to a great little restaurant \"Waldheim\" • or \"home in the woods,\"\n(U//FOUO) Patch Barracks, near Stuttgart:\n\nhome to EUCOM HQ and NCEUR,\n\nDarmstadt: The European Security Center (U//FOUO)\n(U//FOUO) On the morning of Wednesday 11 January, we traveled to Darmstadt\nvisit with the 66th MI Group m ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i t y Center, C O ^ ^ ^ ^\nMI GF\nLTC ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ E S C D i r e c t o r i a l\nESC Deputy Director; and their energetic team provided an outstanding\noverview of their organizational structure, operations, successes and challenges,\n(U//FOUO) The E S C ^ is a functioning part of the enterprise. They've made great\nstrides in their analytic expertise. The analytic support received from SID/S2/SSG\nis great and continues to expand, S2 elements, in particular GEO, CT, RT and CP,\nwere lauded for their outstanding support. The ESC, as an A&P-forward function\ngives them many advantages. Their state-of-the-art operations area allows t h e m\nquick, deployable, and operational partnerships. Weekly VTCs with virtual teams\nfor targets relevant to the EUCOM theater help them maintain perspective,\nWiesbaden: The European Technical Center (U//FOUO)\n(U//FOUO) We drove on to Wiesbaden that evening. We met up with folks from the\nETC for dinner (at a great restaurant - The Winkger (yes, the Vikinger)) to get to\nknow a bit about each other and to help set the stage for Thursday's visit. Through\na series of briefings we gained a good perspective on the critical role ETC plays in\nthe enterprise and gained an appreciation of how we can work together to benefit\nthe enterprise. We also held a town meeting with the ETC team where I reiterated\nwhat a great job they are doing with customers, partners, and Third Party\nrelationships.\nImpressions (U)\n(U//FOUO) Throughout the visit, the knowledge and insights our personnel gain by\nbeing \"forward\" in the customer's domain was evident. Even more impressive was\nhow their knowledge of other operations centers, such as NSA HQ, the Cryptologic\nCenters, SCS, mission ground stations - just to name a few - was being leveraged to\nrespond to the needs of the EUCOM customer. By knowing how the cryptologic\nsystem operates, and knowing how to insert requirements, our personnel are able\nto make siqnificant contributions to the cryptoloqic enterprise. In addition, they\nqrow professionally and personally - by seeinq our Aqency from a different\nperspective, qaininq a broader understandinq of how we're viewed, and by\nexperiencinq life in a different culture,\n(U//FOUO) For more details about NCEUR type \"qo nceur\" on your web browser!\n\n3 of 4\n\n\f4 of 4\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": "CRYPTOME\n10 June 2014\nDEA/NSA SANDKEY Voice Intercepts\nA sends:\nEnclosed are three images that are the heart of the NSA SANDKEY program. SANDKEY is a joint DEA/NSA program that intercepts and\nexploits unencrypted VHF voice communications of narco-traffickers at sea.\nSANDKEY targets those communications of and between maritime vessels operating in the Caribbean and southwest waters. It may intercept\ncommunications between the mother ship and go-fast boats or between the mother ship and shore. Primarily it extracts intelligence based on\nvoice communications and through Radio Direction Finding, vectors law enforcement asserts to the mother ship. For example, a Panama\nExpress-South (PANEX-S) team will, through an informant, know a certain boat's departure, SANDKEY will be tipped-off to monitor the traffic\nand a US Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) will conduct the interdiction. SANDKEY, over it's long-life, has detected and\nidentified the major drug trafficking corridors in the southwest and Caribbean through direction finding and analysis.\nSANDKEY is a traditional Direction Finding program and provides NSA a sense of pride in this regard.\nSANDKEY is considered a great program and largely responsible for the reduced narco-trafficking by boat. The program is administered by\nthe SANDKEY committee, which includes NSA and DEA, USCG, law enforcement, and the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) which is highly\ninvolved. EPIC receives little scrutiny but is a major intelligence player in the central and south Americas and often provides cover for CIA\noperations. A South American government official may not want to talk to the CIA but the DEA is usually welcomed. Given their area\nknowledge, expertise and language proficiency, the DEA conducts \"CIA-like\" clandestine and covert activities throughout Mexico, central and\nsouth Americas and is seen as a force multiplier by the US Government in that regard, freeing the CIA for other activities. There was extensive\nDEA/CIA collaboration when reducing the FARC problem.\nThe FCC, beloved of ham radio operators, is a major player in SANDKEY. The expertise the FCC has in traditional Radio Direction Finding\nwith its CONUS collection antennas, ostensibly for enforcement of Title 47, provides such accurate geo-location that some Naval commanders\non the Joint Task Forces would only interdict if the FCC provides geo-location data (the \"cut\"). This information is provided so American\nguerillas will practice appropriate OPSEC/EMSEC in the troubles to come.\nThis disclosure also manifests from the DEA subversion of the US Constitution through the Hemisphere/DICE fiasco. You're not allowed to\nhave intelligence programs anymore.\nThe irony of the program is the voice intercepts are translated and gisted by immigrant Hispanics, military veterans included, from those\ncountries. It's a nice job for them.\n\n\f'\n\nCONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nFCC - HFDF Network\nQ\n\nOperational\n\n\nNon-operational\n\nKenai, Alaska\nCanandalgua. NY\n\nFerndale. WA\n\nBelfast.

    "doc_text": "(U) DEA - The \"Other\" Warfighter\nDEA Account Manager (S112)\nRun Date: 04/20/2004\n(U//FOUO) When you think about our top national security threats, chances are that terrorism and\nmilitary conflict come quickly to mind - and for good reason. But how many of us list illegal\nnarcotics among the top threats to our society? Our national leadership recognized the seriousness\nthis problem poses and declared a war on drugs two decades ago. This \"war\" has all the risks,\nexcitement, and dangers of conventional warfare, and the stakes are equally high.\n(U//FOUO) We are all aware that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is leading our\nnation's counternarcotics (CN) efforts. But many are not aware that from the start NSAhas been at\nthe forefront of Intelligence Community (IC) support to this seemingly unconventional DOD\nmission. The novel collection and analysis techniques NSA developed and refined against these\ncriminal hard targets have not only resulted in major successes in the war on drugs, but they have\nalso proven invaluable to other critical SIGINT missions, particularly counterterrorism, sometimes\nblurring the lines between the two missions.\n(C) DEA has close relationships with foreign government counterparts and vetted foreign partners.\nThe results of this team approach regularly make the headlines in the form of major drug busts and\narrests. Less known is the critical supporting role that NSA continues to play in key DEA operations\nto disrupt the flow of narcotics to our country and thwart other, related crimes. DEA, however,\nrecognizes the unique access and sole source information NSA provides and coordinates major\ncases with the S2F/ICN Product Line.\n(C) As a result, both agencies enjoy a vibrant two-way information sharing relationship that\nenhances their common mission. Processes have been carefully established to exchange lead\n(foreign intelligence) information while protecting NSA equities. The Customer Relationships\nDirectorate (SI), the Data Acquisition Directorate (S3), and MRSOC work with the S2F/ICN office\nas an integrated team to realize these mission successes.\n(S//SI) One of those successes: Based on SCS (US-966L) intercept, S2F/ICN issued an OPS\nIMMEDIATE report on 30 March 2004 on the exact whereabouts of Colombian narcotics trafficker\nGonzalo Hinojosa, an evasive and brutal international fugitive wanted for murder, drug trafficking,\nand money laundering. S2F had the foresight to include a tearline to share the actionable\nintelligence with Panamanian partners. With a short window for action, N S A ' s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nworked through the Joint Interagency Task Force (JÏTF) - South to immediately forward the\ninformation to DEA/Panama. DEA/Panama in turn alerted the Panamanian authorities who quickly\nlocated and apprehended Hinojosa, without knowing the information came from NSA SIGINT. As\nChief\nnoted, this is an excellent example of \"outcome- oriented collaboration.\"\n(U//FOUO) To learn more about NSA support to the \"other\" warfighter, DEA, visit the International\nCrime and Narcotics (S2F) website.\n\n\f\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet without\ndie consent of S0121 (PL sid conims).\"\nInformation\nPage Publisher:\nLast Modified: 11/09/2012 / Last\nReviewed: 11/09/2012\n\n(email)\n(emaili\n\nDYNAMIC PAGE - HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL\nTO USA AUS CAN G B R N Z L DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007\nDECLASSIFY ON: 20320108\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": " \n\ncompmer center Intro: Here in 82F, we?ve had great success\nusing systems that buffer full-take audio collection for a\nnominal 30 days -- these systems have led to real\nbreakthroughs in target discovery -- and we wanted to alert\nother to their potential. Collectors: please take note\nofhow beneficial these types of collectors can be to\nas compared to more traditional models.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSOMALGET is a family of collection systems which greatly facilitate and\nmake possible remarkable new ways of performing both target development1 and target\n\ndiscovery.2 Significant analytic breakthroughs and successes in both areas have been\nin the two cormtries where SOMALGET accesses currently exist\nand the Bahamas).\n\n(U) How It Works:\n\nSOMALGET collection systems forward full?take metadata in real time\n\nand buffer full?take audio for nominally 30 days.3 It makes POSSible the self-TIM? 0f\naudio content against the buffered data after the fact, in near real-time, or up to 30 days\nlater. This ability is dubbed \"retrospective retrieval.\" The power of retrospective\nretrieval in facilitating target development or discovery lies in its ability to permit the\nanalyst to selectively retrieve audio content and immediately validate hisfher tentative\nanalytic conclusions derived from metadata.\n\n- SOMALGET access to Bahamian GSM commtmications has led to\nthe discovery of: international narcotics traffickers and special?interest alien\nsmugglers. This access -- together with our use of methods that take advantage of\n\ntargets' behavioral patterns4 -- have allowed our 82F to gain a firm\ntmderstanding of the targets' activities even when these contacts occurred prior to\ntheir discovery.\n\n(U) More to Come?\n\nThese successes, which depend on access to buffered audio files that may\nbe associated with selectors not tasked to the collection asset in question, argue in\nfavor of:a collection methodology for telephony that may be viewed as analogous to\nKE YS CORE. That is, we buffer certain calls that MA be of foreign intelligence\nvalue for a sufficient'period to permit a well?informed decision on whether to\n\nret] ieve and return speci?c audio content With proper engineering and coordination,\nthere is little reason this capability camiot expand to other accesses (besides\n\n_Iand the Bahamas), provided compatible hardware and interfaces are\ndeveloped and deployed.5\n\n(U) Notes:\n\n1. (U) Target development the process by which an analyst can extend his/her\nknowledge of a known target by observing elements of metadata that relate to that\ntarget.\n\n2. (U) Target discovery the process whereby an analyst can discover targets by\nobserving metadata as it relates to behaviors characteristic of hisxher target set,\nregardless of whether or not the newly discovered selectors are related to known\ntargets.\n\n3. The nominal \"30 days storage\" actually varies depending upon on\nspace, power, and observed activity levels.\n\n4. Observing that targets tend to use prepaid calling cards in an attempt\nto mask the destination of telephone calls, 82F focused on mobile identifiers in number\nranges that represent newly activated accounts. We have also used SMS text messages\nto identify and retrieve audio of interest.\n\n5. (SWSUXREL) Storage capacity is directly related to the amount of disk storage that\ncan be deployed. When deployed against entire networks, as SOMALGET is, the back-\nend database and processing required for interactive search and retrieval of cuts also\nrequires enterprise-class data warehousing and high-performance processing to manage\nthe vast amount of data captured. Currently this warehouse dynamically manages\nroughly 5 billion call events, with the capacity to expand well beyond our current target\ncommunications. This retrospective retrieval infrastructure is web based and is already\nin place. As noted, with proper engineering and coordination, there is little reason this\ncapability cannot expand to other accesses, provided compatible hardware and\ninterfaces are developed and deployed.\n\n",

Cusick, Director Foreign Affairs (DIRFA)\nBACKGROUND: (U//FOUO) As General Alexander’s UK counterpart, Sir Iain has visited\nNSA on several occasions as one would expect, both in his current position and previous ones.\nSir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air Chief Marshal\nSir Stuart Peach. That visit had a more defined purpose of introducing Sir Stuart to\nUSCYBERCOM and NSA leadership as the Commander of the UK’s newly-established Joint\nForces Command. This will be the first visit in some time that will allow the visitor to reconnect\nwith NSA Leadership on NSA/GCHQ matters.\nPURPOSE OF THE VISIT: (U//FOUO) As the Director of GCHQ, Sir Iain wants to reconnect\nwith NSA Leadership on matters of mutual concern, and to ensure each partner is aware of the\nother’s activities and future plans.\nCDR/DCDR/DDIR GUIDANCE: (U) N/A\nPREP SESSION GUIDANCE: (U//FOUO) NONE\nNSA/CSS REQUESTED: (U//FOUO) NONE\nCYBERCOM REQUESTED: (U//FOUO) NONE\nKEY TOPIC AREAS:\n(TS//SI//NF) FAD and SUSLOL are not aware of any particular issues that Sir Iain will want to\naddress. NSA leadership should still be aware of the following topics that may pertain to their\norganizations or areas of responsibility, as the potential exists for them to be brought up by the\nvisitor:\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) FAA 702 Data: Unsupervised access to FAA 702 data, in a manner similar\nto Olympics Option, remains on GCHQ’s wish list and is something its leadership still\ndesires. NSA and SID leadership are well aware of GCHQ’s request for this data, and the\nsteps necessary for approval. NSA leadership could be asked whether we’re still\nsupportive of this initiative. On a related topic, progress continues on “Triage 2.0,”\nGCHQ access to FAA 702 data under supervised conditions. The MOA is now back in\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRET//SI //NOFORN\n\n\fTOPSECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nGCHQ’s court awaiting signature. With that said, GCHQ seems less enthused about\nTriage, perhaps in part because of the long steps necessary to gain approval. For\nadditional background about these topics, see the attached paper that Mr.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXX, SID Associate Deputy Director, Counterterrorism\n(ADD/CT) SIGINT Authorities Lead, NSA/CSS Counterterrorism Mission Management\nCenter (CTMMC) prepared for D/DIR’s April 2013 UK visit.\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) UK Intelligence Community Oversight: GCHQ and its sister intelligence\nagencies are challenged with their activities and operations being subject to increased\nscrutiny and oversight from their government (and public). As a result, closer attention is\nbeing paid to how UK-produced intelligence data is being used by NSA, and other\npartners. It is possible that Sir Iain may ask about what safeguards NSA may be putting\nin place to prevent UK data from being provided to others, the Israelis for instance, who\nmight use that intelligence to conduct lethal operations. For additional information about\nthis subject, and other UK Intelligence Community legal issues and legislation, see the\nattached paper prepared by Mr. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Office of the General Council, London.\n\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Syria: Prime Minister Cameron continues to look to the UK security and\nintelligence agencies for recommended courses of action to influence the outcome in\nSyria, but to this point GCHQ has not offered much beyond messaging and limited online\neffects operations. GCHQ’s ability to contribute significantly to the overall Syria SIGINT\neffort is hampered by GCHQ’s limited resources. It should be noted that the UK\nIntelligence Community is just as concerned about the end state of Syria’s chemical and\nbiological weapons as the U.S. Intelligence Community. Sir Iain may want to discuss\nSyria’s use of chemical weapons and how the U.S. Government intends to react. For\nmore information about NSA’s posture against Syria, see attached Near East Divisionproduced paper on Syria.\no (TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Points: Syria remains\nlocked in a protracted struggle, with both the opposition and the regime firmly\nentrenched in their positions. Attempts to coalesce the opposition have moved\nextremely slowly, while the regime has not in any way indicated that it would\nwillingly stand aside. Given this lack of movement in negotiations and the\nstalemate on the ground, we anticipate the conflict will not be resolved in an\nexpedient manner.\no (TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA continues to monitor the situation in\nSyria from all angles, including from the viewpoint of the regional, international,\nand radical actors. NSA remains concerned about chemical weapons security and\ncontinues to monitor the situation closely, to the best of our ability.\n\n-\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Iran: GCHQ and the UK Government remain concerned about events in\nIran and the possibility that tensions with the West or Israel could escalate. The visitor\nmay ask NSA and SID leadership to share their views on what is going to happen with\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRET//SI //NOFORN\n\n\fTOPSECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nIran, to include potential Israeli response. For information about NSA’s posture against\nIran, see attached Iran Division produced paper on Iran.\no (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Director Talking Point: Emphasize that we have\nsuccessfully worked multiple high-priority surges with GCHQ that have allowed\nus to refine maintaining mission continuity and seamless transition, and maximize\nour target coverage. These jointly-worked events include the storming of the\nBritish Embassy in Tehran, Iran’s discovery of FLAME, and support to\npolicymakers during the multiple rounds of P5 plus 1 negotiations.\n-\n\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, GBR) Global Collaboration Environment (GCE): On 2 April\n2013, SID Foreign Partner Strategist (FPS) Mr. XXXXXXXX, held a discussion with\nMr. XXXXXX (Head of Bilateral and Multilateral Relations, GCHQ International\nRelations) to discuss the future of GCE in a post-Afghanistan era. GCE is the next\ngeneration of PARTNERMALL (PMP) and should be the future partner collaboration\nsolution of choice. GCE expands the current single collaboration environment PMP\ncapability into a bilateral and multilateral model. The two discussed the benefits of NSA\nand GCHQ having a united front in its dealings with the other foreign partners on this\nissue. They also discussed the possibility of the UK hosting a permanent facility where\nanalysts from partner nations could be co-located, along with ways to better integrate\nGCE into each partner’s analytic workflow. For information about this discussion, see\nthe attached paper prepared by SID’s Foreign Partner Strategist Office.\no (S//REL TO USA, GBR) Director Talking Points: Thank GCHQ for giving full\nsupport to GCE, and for partnering with NSA to engage in synchronized\nmessaging to other organizations.\no (S//REL TO USA, GBR) Encourage GCHQ to host the permanent facility for the\njoint SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) collaboration center, in order to maximize\nthe benefit for the Five Eyes partnership.\no (S//REL TO USA, GBR) Offer NSA’s assistance in finding good solutions for\nincorporating GCE access into GCHQ’s analytic workflow. Encourage GCHQ to\nengage with NSA’s TD on this subject.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: (U//FOUO) See above.\nVISIT FORMAT: (U//FOUO) General Alexander will host a dinner in honor of Sir Iain at his\nresidence on 30 April 2013. The two directors will also have a one-on-one discussion on 1 May\n2013. The remainder of Sir Iain’s agenda will involve NTOC and TAO tours/demos, along with\ndiscussions with NSA Leadership, including Ms. Teresa H. Shea, SIGINT Director, Mrs. Debora\nA. Plunkett, IAD DIR, Mr. Rajesh De, General Council, Mr. Wayne M. Murphy, D/DIR\nAnalysis and Production, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, D/DIR Data Acquisition Mrs. XXXX\nXXXXXX, D/DIR NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC), Mr. Robert E.

Sir Iain most recently visited NSA on 27 March 2012, when he accompanied Air\nChief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach. During that visit, Sir Iain met with General Alexander,\nMr. Inglis, and other NSA and USCYBERCOM leaders.\nPOTENTIAL LANDMINES: (TS//SI//NF) GCHQ has long advocated that it work with NSA\nand the Israeli SIGINT Service (ISNU) in a trilateral arrangement in prosecuting the Iranian\ntarget. SID policy has been opposed to such a blanket arrangement, and the specific trilateral\nexplained in the attached paper on Iran should not be interpreted as a broad change of approach.\nIn other areas, NSA and GCHQ have agreed to continue to share information gleaned from the\nrespective bilateral relationships with ISNU.\nOTHER INFORMATION (GOOGLE SEARCH, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS,\nINTERESTING FACTS, NCR/LNO ADVICE…) (U) NONE\nRECENT PRESS INDICATIONS: (U) N/A\n\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20380401\nTOPSECRET//SI //NOFORN\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": " 2009 SIGDEV Conference: 'Best Yet and Continuing to Improve'\n\nFROM: --I\n\nSIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG)\nRun Date: 08/14/2009\n\nSIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (S SG) hosted the annual Five-Eyes event\nfrom 1-5 June, attracting approximately 1372 participants, including 297 travelers to Fort Meade, of\nwhom 100 were Second Party delegates. Eighty-six representatives from the wider US Intelligence\nCommunity, covering agencies as diverse as CIA (a record 50 participants), the Air Force Research\nLaboratory and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center were also in attendance. who\ncould not attend the conference were able to view streamed live presentations.\n\nThis large and diverse audience is drawn together each year in recognition that this key,\nsingle event enables unprecedented visibility of SIGINT Development activities from across the\nExtended Enterprise, Second Party and US Intelligence communities. More importantly, it provides a\nway for these disparate groups to discovery efforts, share breakthroughs, and swap\nknowledge on the art of analysis. The SIGDEV Conference (SDC) engagement continues to enable the\nIntelligence Community to perform mission and achieve results none could achieve on their own.\n\nOver 200 separate briefings, demonstrations, roundtables, workshops and tours were\noffered throughout the week across five threads. Chris Inglis, Deputy Director NSA, delivered the SDC\nintroductory remarks and Bran Ferren (right), Co-Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Applied Minds\nInc., delivered an engaging keynote address on this year's theme, From Ideas to Outcomes.\"\nBoth speakers highlighted the increasing focus of the digital information age and the challenges facing\nSIGINT operating in cyberspace, a likely area of specific focus for neXt year's SDC.\n\nIn particular, Mr Inglis (left) spoke of how the US and its allies face huge challenges with\ncyberspace as \"no domain is so richly populated,\" has more information stored within it, underpins so\nmany other domains, changes as \"rapidly, agilely or fluidly\" or requires the application of diverse skill\nsets. In Mr Inglis's words, \"the need to understand and lay bare cyberspace is the stuff of it\nwill underpin our success in this space.\" The need for the offensive (SIGINT) and defensive\n(Information Assurance) realms to integrate was flagged as critical, with Mr Inglis suggesting that the\nfuture may see the community talk about SIGDEV as development\", given that\n\"increasingly, SIGDEV is the necessary underpinning for the totality of what we do in cyberspace.\"\n\nAssociate Deputy Director for SIGDEV and  Chief\n\nSignals Survey Analysis, presented the annual DILKE-ALLEN Award, Charlie Tevis Community\nService Award and the Gold Pulse Award.*\n\nAs in 2008, we included facilitated sessions in this year's conference and found that they\ncontinue to prove their value by resulting in focused discussions, generating clear actions for post-\nconference efforts. For the first time in SDC history, this year's conference included an entire one-day\nthread focused on the Future Technology Threat, the results of which will help us keep up with ever-\nchanging technology trends. Because of this success, we will continue to offer narrow-focused threads\nin the upcoming conferences.\n\nIn another first for the 2009 conference, the Communications System Analysis thread\nconducted four \"hands-on\" workshops that brought together from various agencies to work\n\nsome of the Extended Enterprise's most challenging problems. In one of the workshops, a facilitated\nsession was dedicated to botnets. This provided an opportunity to demonstrate some of the Agency's\nmost powerful analytic tools and an opportunity for exchange of information among the in\nattendance. The workshop also provided an opportunity to go over all the SIGINT tools and techniques\nthat are used in the identification and processing of this malicious software, generating possible new\nways for identification and exploitation. The workshops provided an excellent opportunity for our\njunior to work side by side with some of the leading experts in this field. Our intentions next\nyear are to push for more of these types of workshops.\n\nThe Five-Eyes SIGDEV Heads received detailed summaries of each thread's outcomes and\nactions during the conference wrap-up session. momentum and activity is being maintained\nby thread leads and analytic tradecraft teams with quarterly updates on SDC efforts and actions to be\nprovided to those Five-Eyes SIGDEV Heads. This increased effort in post-conference engagement is\nseen as a key factor in living up to the SDC 2009 conference theme, whereby Five-Eyes SIGDEV\nelements will work to take SDC 2009 ideas and turn them into SIGINT outcomes.\n\nIf you weren't able to attend, you can still benefit by viewing presentations and sessions at\nthe SDC 2009 webpage (\"go sdc2009\").\n\nAfter-conference surveys were distributed to those who had registered for the conference.\nResults are still coming in and will be posted on the SDC2009 website as soon as possible. Comments\nfrom these surveys are extremely critical as we begin planning for the 7-11 June 2010 conference.\nFurther details regarding 2010 conference themes and key dates will be revealed in the coming months.\n\n(U) Notes:\n\nNominations for the 2010 DILKE-ALLEN Award are now being accepted. Please canvas\nyour organization to identify SIGINT Development activities where two or more Five-Eyes agencies\nhave come together to produce exceptional work that is worthy of the 2010 award. To find out more\nabout the award nomination submission process, and see a list of the 2009 award winners to include the\nwinning submission, visit the award website.\n\n",

My opinions are not formed from recent first-hand\nexperience, but t h r o u g h previous stimuli t o my cerebrum t h a t have been confirmed by 2nd hand\nexperience over t h e last couple of years. When I first went t o Blackhat/Defcon, it was with t h e\nwide-eyed anticipation of, \"I'm going t o go listen t o all of t h e talks t h a t I can, soak up all of t h e\ninformation possible, and become a supar-1337-haxxor.\" What a let-down of an experience t h a t\nwas. You find t h e most interesting topics and briefings, wait in lines t o get a seat, and find\nyourself straining your ears t o listen t o someone t h a t has basically nothing new t o say Most of\nt h e talks get hyped up exponentially past any amount of substance they actually provide, most of\nt h e \"interactive sessions\" end up in a \"oh! woe is t h e state of t h e security industry!\" chant, and\nleave t h e audience no better off t h a n before.\n(U//FOUO) If you want t o learn crazy new things, more often t h a n not, you won't find it at a talk in a\ncon. Why not walk around NSA, find people in offices t h a t do things you find interesting, and talk\nt o t h e m about how they do what they do(or find a mentor in t h a t area)? Despite stereotypes of\nt h e kinds of people t h a t work here, many people are kind and open enough t o share their\ntrade-craft with others. We have t h e luxury of working in a community t h a t has some of t h e\nbrightest, smartest, and most cutting edge people around, it would be a shame for people t o\nconstantly a t t e n d cons hoping t o learn t h a t \"cool new thing\", when t h e r e is exponentially more\nknowledge sitting around t h e m every single day at work.\n(U//FOUO) Granted, t h e r e are always a couple exceptional talks at t h e cons, but, in my humble\nopinion, they don't make up for t h e overall lack of content. So, what good are t h e s e conferences?\nMy personal opinion is t h a t their utility is mainly for social interaction and meeting »relatively*\nlike-minded individuals. It's t h e ability t o kick back for a weekend and geek-out with other people.\nFor some, this makes t h e cost of t h e con completely worth it, others may be severely\ndisappointed...it all depends on what you expect t o get out of it.\nC u r r e n t Mood:(c)okay\n\nLeave a comment\n\n\fS E C R E T / / S I / / R E L\n\nCopyright!\n\n(U)\n\n,\n\nhunt S)G\n\n|NTs\n\n_\n\n(part\n\n^\n\nTO\n\nU S A ,\n\nP V E Y\n\nQ S P 1\n\n(hide)\n\n2012.12.12- 10:10 am\n\nDo not reuse\nimage!\n(S/SI//REL) So, SIGINT is down right cool. As much as we complain about our \"Big Data Problem\",\ncollection/processing issues, dismal infrastructure/outdated browsers/OS's, our ability t o pull bits\nout of random places of t h e Internet, bring t h e m back t o t h e mother-base t o evaluate and build\nintelligence off of is just plain awesome!\n(S/SI//REL) One of t h e coolest things about it is h o w much data we have at our fingertips. If we\n•only* collected t h e data we knew we wanted...yeah, we'd fill some of our requirements, but this is\na whole world of possibilities we'd be missing! It would be like going on a road-trip, but wearing a\nblindfold t h e entire time, and only removing it when you're at one of your destinations...yeah,\nyou'll still see stuff, but you'll be missing out on t h e entire journey!\n(S/SI//REL) So I decided t o write a short series (affectionately titled 7 hunt...')\non things t h a t I'm\ntrying t o do with data t h a t wouldn't normally be interesting by itself, but by thinking about it in a\nnew way, makes it extremely valuable. My interests lately have been in using passive collect t o\nidentify/enable CNE efforts, so that's predominantly what t h e first few topics will be about.\n(U//F0U0) If t h e r e are any topics someone wants t o see specifically, let me know. As well, if any of\nt h e following information is useful, please let me know and I can put more out.

If you already know this, feel free to skip forward to the next sections.\n\nsys admins in\n\n(S/SI//REL) Being in SID, our overall goal is t o produce intelligence t o give t o decision-makers. How\nwe go about doing that, is whenever a t a r g e t uses technology t o communicate, we collect it,\nanalyze it, and write reports on it. Sounds simple enough...except for t h e fact t h a t we have t o be\nt a r g e t e d in what networks we collect. We can't collect everything all t h e time, so if a t a r g e t starts\nt o communicate on a network where we are not collecting, t h e r e is some manual leg-work t h a t\nhas t o be done t o steer t h e SIGINT system in their direction. This is where I must introduce my\nloyal friend, t h e sys admin.\n(S/SI//REL) Up front, sys admins generally are not my end t a r g e t . My end t a r g e t is t h e\nextremist/terrorist or government official t h a t happens t o be using t h e network some admin takes\ncare of. Sys admins are a means t o an end. For example, assume your t a r g e t is using a CDMA\ndevice on a foreign network; t h e r e may be situations where we passively collect his phone\ncall/SMS out in t h e wild, but it would be * r e a l l y * nice if we had access t o t h e local infrastructure\nwhere we could monitor which tower he's connected t o at any given point in time, or monitor all\nphone calls/data traffic t h a t his phone generates. Many times, it's difficult t o directly t a r g e t\ninfrastructure...generally we'll need a fair amount of information going into an operation, such as:\n* topology of t h e network we are t a r g e t i n g\n* credentials for infrastructure devices\n* situational knowledge, such as access lists set up t o only allow specific IP addresses t o\nadminister certain machines\n* an overall knowledge of how t h e network is put t o g e t h e r and configured\n(S/SI//REL) In order t o get that, who better t o t a r g e t t h a n t h e person t h a t already has t h e 'keys t o\nt h e kingdom'? Many times, as soon as I see a t a r g e t show up on a new network, one of my first\ngoals is, \"Can we get CNE access t o t h e admins on t h a t network, in order t o get access t o t h e\ninfrastructure t h a t t a r g e t is using?\"\n\" Yeah, that pretty\n\nmuch makes sense, but how are you 'just gonna get CNE access' on an admin?\"\n\n(S/SI//REL) Good question, thanks for asking. Most of t h e time I'm going t o rely on QUANTUM t o get\naccess t o their account (yeah, you could try spam, but people have been getting smarter over\nthe last 5-10 years...it's not as reliable anymore). So, in order t o work our QUANTUM-magic on an\nadmin, we'll need some sort of webmail/facebook selector for them.\n\"You know, you \"could* just look up the 'point of contact'\nwith their IP space/domain\nnames...\"\n\nin the registry\n\ninformation\n\nassociated\n\n(S/SI//REL) Yeah, you could do t h a t . Personally, I haven't had a huge amount of luck with it,\nbecause most of t h e time I end up running across their •official * e-mail address that's hosted on\ntheir own network. That's generally not a recipe for success in t h e QUANTUM world, what we'd\nreally like is a personal webmail or facebook account t o target. There's a couple ways you could\ntry this: dumpster-dive for alternate selectors in t h e big SIGINT t r a s h can, or pull out your wicked\nGoogle-fu t o see if they've posted on any forums and list both their official and non-official e-mails\nin a signature block...but what if t h e r e was another way t o do it?\n(S/SI//REL) Other fun (read:useful) things t o get off of a sys admin (from my point of view):\n* network maps off of their hard drive\n* credentials from text files (or from our key-loggers...potato potato)\n• f u l l lists of customers (along with associated dedicated IP allocations is a bonus)\n* e-mail with upstream providers detailing how your network is connected t o t h e bigger Internetz.\nFor example, if I see they use certain fiber cables t o connect t o t h e world, I'll go look in SSO's\ncollect for their traffic. If they use VSAT's, I'll go look for their network in FORNSAT's environment.\n* pictures of cats in funny poses with amusing captions\n(S/SI//REL) But all of this boils down t o getting an admin's webmail/facebook account in order t o\nQUANTUM it and get CNE access t o their box. Next section will detail t a r g e t i n g admins who use\ntelnet...\n3 c o m m e n t s :: Leave a comment\n\n\fTOP\n\nCopyright!\n\nS ECRET / / S I / /RE L\n\nTO\n\nOSA.\n\nPVEY\n\n(U) 1 hunt adm ins that use telnet (part 3)\n\n•\n\nS\n\nP I (hide)\n\n2012.12.12- 04:09 pm\n\nDo not reuse\n\nEntry tags: access list, admin, cloud, cne, passive, quantum, sigint, telnet\n\nthis image!\n(S/SI//REL) If a target that 1 care about is on a\ndescribed that I will try to get access to that\ntarget the sys admin, it's easiest if I know what\nthat I can target it with QUANTUM.

This master list\ncontained tons of networks around the world, and the personal accounts of admins for each of\nthose networks. And any time you wanted to target a new network, you could just find the admin\nassociated with it, queue his accounts up for QUANTUM, get access to his box and proceed to pwn\nthe network. Wouldn't that be swell?\n(S/SI//REL) Well, you can stop dreaming my friends, I think it's possible (at least kinda partially).\nAnd we'll get started on this endeavor by chasing down admins that use telnet. By this point, I'm\nhoping you're saying, \"Telnet? Telnet?! No one should still be using telnet!\" That is the correct\nresponse, however, telnet (as an administrative tool on the Internet) is alive and well. In fact, it's\nso alive and well, DISCOROUTE is a tool specifically designed to suck up and database router\nconfiguration files seen in passively collected telnet sessions (for the record, DISCOROUTE is\nawesome, and you should check it out if you have at least one iota of love for SIGINT). So, what\nshall we do with all of these configuration files?\n\"Dude! Map all the\n\nnetworks!!!\"\n\n(S/SI//REL) Yes, that\nsomething that will\nnecessarily going to\ngetting CNE access\nquestion:\n\nis definitely a useful thing to do with all of these router configs, and is\nneed to be done. But understanding the topology of a network isn't\nget us access to that network...per my previous post, I mentioned how\nto an admin is usually a golden ticket into the network. So, this raises a\n\n\"How can w e use a r o u t e r configuration file t o find t h e p e r s o n a l\naccounts of a sys admin?\"\n\nwebmail/facebook\n\n(S/SI//REL) To illustrate this point, I randomly picked a config for a router in Kenya...the link is NF,\nso send me an e-mail if you'd like to look at the config in it's entirety For now, I'll just copy/paste\nthe relevant portions. This process, as with any analysis at it's most fundamental level, is based\non assumptions. Here are probably some safe assumptions:\n• W e have a router, and that router has an admin\n* By the nature of having the config in DISCOROUTE, the admin uses telnet to log into the router\n* T h e admin probably doesn't want to let anyone and everyone else log into the router\n* T h e admin may set up an access control list to only allow his IP addresses to telnet to the router\n(TS/SI//REL) Those seem like relatively safe assumptions to make for the moment. Now, let's see\nhow those manifest in our example Kenyan config (if you're not familiar with router configs, don't\nworry, this will be pretty basic):\n1) First, let's look at the vty (read:telnet) lines on the router, and see if there is an access list\nassociated with them:\ni\n\n! line vty 0 5\naccess-class 11 in\npassword 7 |\n\n(TS/SI//REL) Yup, for all of the telnet lines, access list # 1 1 is applied...which basically means, if you\nwant to telnet to this router, you have to meet the criteria of that access list, (oh, before I forget,\npassword 7's are ROFL-easy to crack. You can google 'cisco password 7 cracker' and get web\npages that allow you to copy the password 7 hash, and it'll break it for free...anyone\ncan figure\nout the password for this router. And pointing out for the lulz, the enable password for this router\nis password 7 hashed as well!)\n2)...anyway, on with the access list #11:\n\naccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccessaccess-\n\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\nlist\n\n\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\npermit\n\n(TS/SI//REL) Okay, this is relatively self-evident. If you want to telnet into this router, you have to be\ncoming from one of those IP addresses that are permitted. Those who are slightly network-saw^'\nwill also be quick to point out, that even if you know the credentials for this router, and know\nwhich IP's are whitelisted, you CAN NOT just spoof the source IP of packets to try to log into this\nrouter...b/c you'd never see the responses. So you »actually* have to have access to one of these\nIP's to log into this router. Fair enough? Mmkay\n(TS/SI//REL) I want to take a quick look back at our assumptions for a sec. We assumed that an\nadmin would allow himself to telnet, but not others. So, based on the combination of that\nassumption with the info from the config, we can make the following assumption:\n\"The IP a d d r e s s e s in t h a t access list probably b e l o n g t o e n t i t i e s t h a t a d m i n i s t e r t h a t\nKenyan network.\"\n(TS/SI//REL) Hopefully that sounds fair enough. Here's the fun part...why don't we take those IP\naddresses, and look for »anyone* actively logging into their hotmail/yahoo/facebook/etc accounts\nfrom those IP addresses within the recent past? With whatever results you get back, you now\nhave a p r o b a b l e list of p e r s o n a l accounts of a d m i n i s t r a t o r s for t h a t K e n y a n n e t w o r k !\nFrom here, if you need CNE access to that network, just pull those selectors, queue them up for\nQUANTUM, and proceed with the pwnage. Yay! /throws confetti in the air\n\"Okay, that sounds relatively\n\nreasonable,\n\nbut that's still a pretty\n\nmanual\n\nprocess...\"\n\n(TS/SI//REL) Yeah, you're correct...but here's where \"the cloud\" actually comes to the rescue\n(yeah, I said it, crucify me)...All of the DISCOROUTE data is dumped into the GM Place cloud. All\nASDF gets dumped into the GM Place cloud (ASDF is the metadata that gets generated for almost\nevery session that we collect in our big bad passive SIGINT system). So, all someone would have\nto do is write a cloud analytic that would do the following:\n-1) parse through all of the router configs in DISCOROUTE\n-—la) identify every router that has an access list tied to a vty (telnet) line\n-—lb) look through the access list, and pull out all public IP addresses\n—-lc) put those public IP addresses in a list somewhere\n-2) parse through all the Active User events in ASDF\n-—2a) take the list of public IP's that are associated with probable sys admins and use it as our\nseed list\n-—2b) look for all Active User login activity from those IP addresses\n-—2c) take all accounts that come back and put those into another list\n(TS/SI//REL) So, by combining all of that information, you end up with a list of public IP addresses\nthat probably belong to sys admins as well as personal accounts that probably belong to those\nadmins. All you have to do is put all this info in a database somewhere, and what you end up with\nis a list of networks as well as personal accounts of probable admins for those networks! Then, as\nsoon as one of those networks becomes a target, all TAO has to do is query the database, see if\nwe have any admins pre-identified for that network, and if we do, automatically queue up tasking\nand go-go-CNE!\n(TS/SI//REL) All of this can be done by tweaking the\nf i n g e r t i p s ! ! ! Remember, our \"Big Data Problem\" is that\ndo is find ways of taking disparate data sets that\nthemselves, but when you put them t o g e t h e r in the right\n\ndata that we a l r e a d y have at our\nwe have too much data...all we have to\nwouldn't necessarily be interesting by\nway become simply awesome!\n\n\"Yeah, okay, that's cool and all, but that relies on sys admins being bad and using telnet. */* don't\nuse telnet and most people that I know don't use telnet, it would never be able to identify us!\"\n(TS/SI//REL) Good point, this analytic does rely on admins using telnet. HOWEVER, I have an idea\nfor how to identify personal accounts of admins that use SSH as well, which I'll talk about in my\nnext post (I hunt admins that use SSH)!\nCurrent Moodrscheming\n\n7 c o m m e n t s :: Leave a comment\n\n\fTOP\n\nCopyright!\n\nS E C R E T\n\n/ / S I / / R E\n\nL\n\nTO\n\nO S A ,\n\n(u) | hunt adm ins that use SSH (part 4)\n\nP V E Y\n\nB\n\n\nUS (hide)\n\n2012.12.13- 0 2 : 4 1 p m\n\nDo not reuse\nthis image!\n\nEntry t a g s : cne. quantum, router, server, s s h\n\n(S//SI//REL) Welcome back comrade! It's good to see you again. For background, I talked in this\npost about why I target system administrators when I want CNE access to a network, and I talked\nin this other post about how we can get sys admin's personal selectors (for targeting) based on\nrouter configs that we passively collect through telnet sessions. This begs the obvious retort:\n\"Yeah, but that wouldn't work at all against any sys admin that uses SSH, because\nsee the content of the config! It's\nencrypted!\"\n\nwe would never\n\n(S//SI//REL) That is absolutely correct, however, Options Exist! I still think it's possible to identify a\nsys admin's personal account (sometimes) e v e n if they use SSH. First off, if you're at all unfamiliar\nwith SSH, please feel free to check out the resource graciously posted by one of my favorite\nhigh-side online personas,\nlocated here.\n(S//SI//REL) Before we get into the methodology, let's talk about SSH for a minute, and some\nassumptions that we're going to make (up front caveat: I'm assuming we're looking for SSH on\nport 22. I'm sure there's ways to find it on non-standard ports, but just for the sake of clarity, I'll\nrefer to SSH sessions as defined by being on port 22). Let's assume that you try to use SSH to\nconnect to some seiver:\n\n(U//FOUO) Assuming 1.2.3.4 actually has SSH listening on port 22, it'll go through the 3-way TCP\nhandshake, and the server will send you back some packets and something like this may pop up:\n\nWarning!\nT h i s i s a b a n n e r f o r some r o u t e r\ni f y o u ' r e not authorized to log i n to t h i s\nBlah...blah...blah...\nEnter\n\nowned by some company,\ndevice, disconnect immediately!\n\nusername:\n\n(U//FOUO) Here's where you enter your username...we'll pretend you type 'admin' and press\nEnter. Then you get this:\n\n(U//FOUO) Okay, here's where the rubber meets the road. One of two options exist. Either you\nhave the right password, or you don't. Let's explore what would happen under each of the\ncircumstances. First off, let's pretend you do NOT have the right password. You try 'admin' for the\npassword and press enter:\n\n(U//FOUO) If you're password guessing, you'll probably get about 3 tries before the server kills the\nconnection, and you have to reconnect and try again. However, if you do have the right\npassword, you'll log in, you can run your commands to do whatever you want to do, and the seiver\nwill spit back the output for all of the commands that you run.\n(TS//SI//REL) I know, that sounds uber-simple, but here's why it matters. Think about what all of\nthis would look like if we were to observe this in our passive SIGINT system. We would probably see\nencrypted traffic between two IPs, one of the ports would be on port 22 (we'll say that's the seiver\nside). The traffic going TO PORT 22 (in the client-to-seiver direction) will consist of sending a\nusername, sending a password, and sending commands (assuming the client successfully logged\nin). For traffic coming FROM PORT 22, well...that depends.\n(S//SI//REL) If the client does not have the right credentials, we'd expect the seiver-to-client\ndirection to consist of:\n1) sending the device's banner\n2) sending the prompt for a username\n3) sending the prompt for a password\n4) sending another prompt for a password\n5) sending ANOTHER prompt for a password\n6) subsequently giving up, killing the connection, and forcing the client to restart and try again\n(S//SI//REL) If the client d o e s have the right credentials, we might expect the seiver-to-client\ndirection to consist of:\n1) sending the device's banner\n2) sending the prompt for a username\n3) sending the prompt for a password\n4 thru ?) sending back the output for whatever commands the client runs\n(S//SI//REL) So, purely based off of the above assessment, we would expect unsuccessful logins\nto be consistently small (as in, the number of bytes) in the seiver-to-client direction. However,\nsuccessful logins will be of variable length, but probably consistently larger in size (in bytes)\nwhen compared to unsuccessful logins. So, one assumption that I am suggesting is:\nYou can g u e s s t i m a t e w h e t h e r a n SSH session w a s successful or not *PURELY* b a s e d\noff of t h e size of t h e session in t h e server-to-client direction.\n\n(S//SI//REL) So, imagine that you do some analysis, and determine that 1500 bytes is roughly a\ngood number to differentiate between successful/unsuccessful SSH login attempts. Any seiverto-client SSH session below that size is probably an unsuccessful attempt, and any seiverto-client SSH session over that size is probably a successful attempt. What could you do, armed\nwith information like that?\n1) You could create lists of client IP addresses that consistently are unsuccessful in SSH\nsessions to multiple servers. Then you could put these in a, \"probably password\nguessers/probably brute forcers\" list.\n2) You could also create lists of IP addresses that appear to be successful in having access to\nother IPs. (ahhhh yeah, here's where we can have fun)\n(S//SI//REL) I'm sure there are a plethora of other things you can do with that sort of data, but I'm\nreally interested in # 2 at the moment. Based purely off of:\n* FROM port 22\n* session size is greater t h a n 1500 bytes\nt h e n I can infer that:\n* To IP = admin\nFromadmin\nIP = server/router\n* The\nappears to have successful access to the seiver\n\"Aaaaand?\"\n(TS//SI//REL) From here, all I have to do is recycle my methodology from last post! I can scour ALL\nOF SIGINT for sessions that meet the above criteria, haivest a list of \"admin IPs\", use that as a\nseed list to go back through all ASDF looking for any Active User login events within a time frame\nof the SSH session, and now I have personal accounts for people that are probably admins to the\nseiver IP. So if the seiver IP is ever in a network that I want access to, I don't have to decrypt the\nadmin's SSH session, all I have to do is hope he checked his facebook/webmail within a certain\ntimeframe of SSH'ing to the seiver. If he did, that selector is now tasked for QUANTUM, and we\nwait to get access to his box.\n(S//SI//REL) One of the reasons why I'd only look for Active User logins within a certain timeframe of\nan SSH session, is that I want to make sure to find accounts that are actually associated with the\nadmin, and not some other random person who happened to receive that same IP via DHCP the\nnext day (or something like that).\n(S//SI//REL) The previous few posts have gone into some fun ways that we can haivest the power\nof the SIGINTs to target sys admins of foreign networks. My next post will go into an uber-simple\nway that we can try to detect when people o t h e r t h a n the legitimate sys admin have access to a\nrouter (oh yeah, find me somma that cyber!).\n(S//SI//REL) I'm sure there are other fun and innovative ways to go about this, feel free to share\nthem if you think of any Also feel free to take any of the above thoughts/ideas and use them for\nyour own purposes (like IAD maintaining a list of IP's that we see password guessing in SIGINT?).\nAs always, if you have any questions, or want more info, feel free to drop me an e-mail or leave a\ncomment!\nC u r r e n t Mood:juche-licious\n\n21 c o m m e n t s :: Leave a comment\n\n\fTOP\n\nCopyright!\n\n(S//S|//REL)\n\nS E C R E T\n\n/ / SI\n\n/ / R E\n\nL\n\nTO\n\nO S A ,\n\nP V E Y\n\n| h u n t people w h o hack routers (part 5)\n\n•\n\nE\n\nP\n\n2012.12.14- 01:08 pm\n\nEntry t a g s : cne. discoroute, router, sigdev\n\n(TS//SI//REL) Happy Friday my esteemed and valued Intelligence Community colleagues! There has\nbeen a topic of conversation t h a t has started t o rumble beneath t h e surface of t h e Cyber-scene\nlately, it's about router hacking(for this post, I'm not talking about your home ADSL router, I'm\ntalking about bigger routers, such as Ciscos/Junipers/Huaweis used by ISPs for their\ninfrastructure). Hacking routers has been good business for us and our 5-eyes partners for some\ntime now, but it is becoming more apparent t h a t other nation states are honing their skillz and\njoining t h e scene. Before I get into it t o o much, let's go over some of t h e things t h a t someone\ncould do if they hack a router:\n* You could add credentials, allowing yourself t o log in a n y t i m e you choose\n•You could add/change routing rules\n* You could set up a packet capture capability..imagine running Wireshark on an ISP's\ninfrastructure router...like a local listening post for any credentials being passed over t h e wire(!)\n* You could weaken any VPN encryption capabilities on t h e router, forcing it t o create easily\ndecryptable tunnels\n* You could install a dorked version of t h e Operating System with whatever functionality you want\npre-built in\n(TS//SI//REL) There are\nrouter...suffice it t o say,\nt h e victim. So, we would\nrouters (especially if it's\n\na plethora of things you could do once you get CNE access t o a\ngetting access t o a router is very g o o d for t h e actor, and very b a d for\nobviously LOVE t o know which countries/actors have access t o what other\nour routers). Then t h e question comes down to:\n\n\"How would you identify\n\nthe fact that someone\n\nhas CNE access to a router?\"\n\n(TS//SI//REL) There are a handful of ways t h a t you can tell if anyone has access t o y o u r router.\nLike, if you are free t o log into your own router, you could frequently log in, run diagnostic\ncommands, pull t h e IOS (or, more generically, t h e operating system file), hash t h a t file, and\ncompare t h a t t o a list of known-good hashes. But, how would you find out if someone has CNE\naccess t o a router t h a t you don't own? How would you identify it if t h e Chinese had access t o a\nrouter in Zimbabwe? If all you have is passive network traffic t h a t we've collected in SIGINT, how\nwould you do it?\n\nThe rest of this post relates to NSA's methods to detect when countries hack routers. We\nhave redacted it to prevent helping those countries improve their ability to hack foreign\nrouters and spy on people undetected.\n\n\f",

Because SCALAWAG is\nNSA's #1 provider of actionable SIGINT on COUNTRY\nmeasures had to be taken to alleviate pressure on the\nbandwidth and decrease latency of priority 1-2 data. In the summer of\n2011, in an effort decrease the amount of voice content brought home,\n880 deleted a large quantity of priority 4 and below tasking that was\nbringing content and according to the DOUBLEARROW database had\nnot been \"touched\". Additionally, a change of priority 4 tasking to\npriority 6 was effected, again based on DOUBLEARROW results.

What is NSA's underlying motivation behind its dealings with Third Party nations, and what approach do we use? To lind out,\nSIDtodfly asked)\nREDACTED ] (pictured), from the SIGINT Operations Group in NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate to answer a few\nquestions. Here's what\ntold us:\n\nNAME\nREDACTED\n\n• I. (U) Does NSA establish 3rd Party ties to meet specific short-term needs, or do we take a more long-term approach, thinking in\nterms of developing relationships over the course of decades, even though they may not hear fruit for some time?\n(S//SI//REL) We establish foreign partnerships to satisfy U.S. intelligence requirements. For specific short-term needs, it may be sufficient to work through\nCIA Chiefs of Station (CoS) at those locations where we do not have SIGINT partnerships established. Formal relationships require considerable resources, so\nif we can meet our objectives -- particularly short-term ones — working through CIA, that's okay. If, on the other hand, our SIGINT exchanges increase in\nvolume and/or complexity, or if a direct partnership is necessary because of Indications and Warning (I&W) considerations (i.e., we need rapid, direct\nexchange of information), then we will establish a formal SIGINT relationship, after DN1 approval.\n(C//REL) Many of our relationships have, indeed, spanned several decades, allowing us to establish higher degrees of trust with and reliance on one another.\nThis, in turn, has led to greater levels of cooperation, where, for instance, NSA might be willing to share advanced techniques with a proven and reliable\npartner, in return for that partner's willingness to do something politically risky. Trust requires years to build up but it can be lost in a very short period of\n\n• 2. (U) What are we after, in general? Is it our partners' accesses, or their expertise on a specific target... or is it impossible to generalize, because it\nvaries on a case-by-case basis?\n(C//REL) Yes, yes and... yes! Our partners' geography and access to high-priority target communications are a huge plus, as is their expertise on specific\ntargets. With rare exception, they know their regional 'hoods better than we do and they exponentially add to our foreign language capability.\n\n• 3• (U) Are our foreign intelligence relationships usually insulated from short-term political ups and downs, or not?\n(S//SI//REL) For a variety of reasons, our intelligence relationships are rarely disrupted by foreign political perturbations, international or domestic. First, we\nare helping our partners address critical intelligence shortfalls J u s t as they are assisting us. Second, in many of our foreign partners' capitals, few senior\nofficials outside of their defense-intelligence apparatuses are witting to any SIGINT connection to the U.S7NSA.\n(S//SI//REL) There are exceptions, both on the positive and negative sides. For instance, since the election of a pro-American president, one European partner\nhas been much more open to providing information on their own capabilities and techniques, in hope of raising our intelligence collaboration to a higher level.\nConversely, another of our partnerships has stalled, due largely to that country's regional objectives not being in synch with those of the U.S.\n\n• 4. (U) What do Third Parties typically want from us? What do they get out of the relationship?\n(S//SI//REL) Generally speaking, our Third Party partners want access to our technology, as well as our regional/global reach. In exchange for their providing\nunique accesses, regional analytical expertise, foreign language capabilities and/or I&W support, we provide them with technical solutions (e.g.. hardware,\nsoftware) and/or access to related technology. We must keep in mind that our partners are attempting to satisfy their own national intelligence requirements;\nwith the exception of the assistance we provide during crises, we can only move our SIGINT relationships forward, when U.S. requirements intersect with\n\n(C//REL) ...Thank you for the opportunity to describe some of our foreign partnering considerations. It's important for us to foot-stomp that FAD is an\nenabling organization. We do not conduct relationships in a vacuum; and our Country Desk Officers, front-end SIGINT Liaison Officers, Foreign Affairs\nOfficers and staff are wholly committed to being in synch with -- or helping to synchronize — SID. IAD, DIRNSA, DN1, the Under Secretary of Defense for\nIntelligence (USD(I)) and others in the Intelligence Community.\n\n\f",

Hacking routers has been good business for us and our S-eyes partners for some time now, but it is becoming more apparent\nthat other nation states are honing their skill: and joining the scene. Before I get into it too much, let's go over some ofthe things that someone could do ifthey hack a router:\n\nYou could add credentials, allowing yourselfto log in any time you choose\n\nYou could routing rules\n\nYou could set up a packet capture running Wireshark on an lSP's infrastructure a local listening postfor any credentials being passed overthe\nwiret!)\n\nYou could weaken any VPN capabilities on the router, forcing itto creale easily tunnels\n\nYou could install a dorked version ofthe Operating System with whatever functionality you want pre-built in\n\n",

This will set a precedent for access to NSA\nFISA material outside of NSAW.\nBACKGROUND: (TS//SI) As part of CES's strategy for the Extended Enterprise buildout,\ncryptanalysis efforts at the cryptologic centers in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will serve as\ntransparent extensions of the cryptanalysis mission performed by CES in the Office of Target\nPursuit's exploitation branches (S31142, S31143, S31131, and S31133) at NSAW. Analysts at the\ncryptologic centers will become part of a virtual team with NSAW analysts. They will access data\nthat is stored within the CES firewall and will use cryptanalytic procedures and tools, also within\nthe CES firewall, by way of a VPN capability that ensures that security is not compromised and\nthat the data and tools accessed cannot get out to the local network. The priorities of cryptanalytic\nmissions will continue to be set in conjunction with mission elements at NSAW and the Cryptologic\nCenters as appropriate.\n\nCOORDINATION/APPROVAL\n\nF O R M A67S6\nR E V N O V 95\n\nSECURITY CLASSIFICATION\n\nDRV FM: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 23 November 2004 DECLON: 2029] 123\n\n\\\n\n«\n\nTOP 9ECRET!/COMINT/I\\rOrOR\\'//2029U23\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20291123\n\nS3109-080-06\n\n(TS//SI) Cryptanalysts at the cryptologic centers will access data that is stored in the following\ndatabases at NSAW:\nFOURSCORE - fax and DNI data, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived\nZAP - text, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived\nCAPRICORN - voice, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived\nSOAPOPERA - voice, end product, SRI information, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived\n(TS//SI) These databases contain raw data, including enciphered collection, and, when exploitation\nis possible, decrypted plain text. Some of the data in the databases is NSA FISA-derived or FBI CT\nFISA-derived. While not every database contains FISA-derived material, it is reasonable to expect\nt h a t analysts at the CCs wall perform mission with agility, moving across targets and databases as\nmission demands, and that sometimes that will mean accessing data within a database that does\ncontain FISA-derived data. Access to these databases is restricted to analysts who hold the\nRAGTIME ECI, have a specific 'need to know1 about the data stored within the databases, and who\nare authorized by the data owner. For some years CES has been the recipient of improperly\nmarked/classified data but all analysts have been and are aware that data marked with the SIGAD\nUS984J and case notation XKSQF* is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD\n118-984* is NSA FISA data. CES believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the\nclassification of the data before it is fed into our systems. This is an ongoing issue which should not\nimpede the approval of this SPF but the matter should be addressed. CES will ensure that all\nanalysts accessing these databases know that data marked with the SIGAD US984J and case\nnotation XX.SQF* is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD US-984* is NSA\nFISA data, and that this data should be classified TOP SECRET//COMINT - ECI RAGTIME//\nNOFORN. Ideally all FISA and non-FISA material should be held separately, and FBI and NSA\nFISA should be partitioned by individual target. The Office of Oversight and Compliance will work\nwith S3 dataflow and Special Source Operations to correct the markings/classification of data at the\nfront end.\n(S//SI) CES at NSAW will work to ensure that all individuals working the cryptanalysis mission at\nthe CCs have the appropriate clearances for access to sensitive data, including RAGTIME, and will\ndictate specific policy and procedural security measures.\nR E Q U I R E M E N T S : (TS//SI//NF) Following recent meetings and discussions among SID Oversight\nand Compliance (SV) and NSAW CES, the following are recommendations and requirements that\nCES and the Cryptologic Centers should agree to implement prior to accessing, handling,\nprocessing, retaining, and disseminating NSA FISA and CT FBI FISA-derived collection,\nSV requirements: NSA/CSS TX, NSA/CSS GA, and NSA/CSS HI should commit to:\n1) (S//SI) The creation of a permanent FISA coordinator position, to be staffed initially by a\nperson experienced with FISA procedures, to ensure compliance with FISA minimization\nprocedures; build a culture and climate of FISA awareness; and facilitate on-site ability to train,\nfield questions, and handle time-sensitive FISA issues.\n(S//SI) NSA/CSS TX has identified a permanent FISA coordinator; however that\nperson has no FISA experience. The CES Mission Manager at TX, who has FISA experience, must\nperform oversight of CES activities and must participate in the new coordinator's FISA training.\nSID Oversight & Compliance will brief both individuals on their responsibilities.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20291123\ni •\n\n\fT O P SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//2Ö291123\nS3109-080-06\n\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA/CSS GA and NSA/CSS HI have permanent FISA coordinators who\nhave been supporting the Counterterrorism analytic mission. CES must work with those persons to\nensure oversight of CES activities. The FISA coordinators will ensure consistent FISA oversight\nacross all Cryptologic Center activities.\n2) (S//SI) The creation of a core FISA workforce which, at all times, contains a stable body of\npersonnel who ideally have at least one year's experience working FISA. A stable, non-transient\nworkforce ensures a well-founded culture for FISA, as has been established at NSAW over many\nyears. Such a culture minimizes the number of FISA-related violations by reinforcing the\nrequirements» restrictions, and sensitivities of accessing and processing FISA.\n(S//SI) The CES Mission Managers at Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii have FISA\nexperience and will have supervisory responsibilities over all CES employees at those sites. CES\nwill ensure that all cryptanalysts at Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will be trained on how to perform\nthe CES mission and on how to handle sensitive materials; all will be knowledgeable about USSID\nSP0018 and Annex A that describes FISA handling.\n3) (S//SI) Provide assurances and documentation that the on-site physical layout of\nterminals and the means to secure the FISA material is such that access is restricted to only\ncleared personnel with a need for access to the FISA data.\n(S//SI) Seating for individuals performing the cryptanalysis mission will be clustered\ntogether to ensure that they have visual and acoustical privacy for technical conversations and to\nensure that their conversations and the data displayed on their computer screens is neither\naccessible nor viewable by those who do not have the appropriate clearances and a \"need-to-know\".\nIn addition, these individuals will have one or more dedicated printers and combination safes for\nstorage of any authorized FISA material.\n4) (S//SI) Provide assurances that FISA material will not be revealed or disseminated as part\nof site briefings or demonstrations, or in any other format, unless it conforms to and is handled in\naccordance with FISA Court requirements and minimization procedures approved by the Attorney\nGeneral, and NSA dissemination policies and procedures. Due to the sensitivity of the sources and\nmethods used to obtain this collection, it cannot be shared with site visitors or other uncleared\npersonnel without proper minimization and attribution to protect those sources and methods.\nQGC requirements:\n\n(S//SI) Except in exigent circumstances, all personnel that will have access to FISA material should\nreceive initial OGC USSID SP0018 and FBI FISA minimization briefings in person. The briefings\ngiven by OGC are interactive in nature and the personal setting gives OGC a better opportunity to\ninteract with all participants. When in person briefings are not possible, briefings will be done via\nVTC.\nR E C O M M E N D A T I O N : (U) SIGINT DIR concur on access with oversighl as described.\nSIGINT DIR'S DECISION:\nConcur,\n\nNonconcur:\nOther:\n\nDat e :\nDate:\n\nFOP S EC RET//C OMINT//NOFORN//20291123\n\n\fT O P S E C R E T / / C < ) M I NT/720291123\n\nCM IKK,\nSID O V E R S I G H T & COMPLIANCE\n\n4 August 2006\nTO: (U) S1GINT Direcior\nS U n ) : (S) Recommended Requirements for Cryptanalysts at\nCCs at Texas, Georgia and Hawaii to access NSA and FBI\nMSA materia).\n(1S//SI) This request will set a precedent as no prior request\nfor access to NSA FISA material outside NSAW has been\napproved. NSA FISA is SIGINT derived from NSA's own\nsubmissions to the US FISA Court. An individual in SID\nOversight and Compliance (SV). in a personally sworn\ndeclaration to the U S FISA Court, assures the Court that all\nindividuals, wherever located and in any j o b (linguist,\ncrytpanalyst. reporter, collector, etc.). who access or use NSA\nMSA material are trained and will comply with all NSA\nobligations attached to this sensitive access.\n(rS'VSI) While SV supports the S3/CES build out to the\nCrvptologic Centers in principle. SV lias learned that there arc\nexisting deficiencies in classification and handling of N S A\nMSA and FBI FISA material in C E S ' s databases that must be\naddressed and fixed before additional access at the CCs is\napproved.\n(TS//SJ) It is vital that both NSA FISA and FBI FISA material\nbe properly and separately identified so that I) users of that\nmaterial know that they arc accessing NSA FISA or FBI FISA.\nand 2) NSA can remain in compliance with Department of\nJustice and all other obligations for FISA handling and\nminimization. It is possible that there are already FISA\nviolations resulting from the way data iias been stored in these\ndatabases and it is critical (hat these problems be fixed before\nthe problems are spread to new l o c a t i ^ s . ^ ^ ^\n^\nixad\n\n>0041123\n\nOtiUnify Or 20291129\n\nTOP\n\nSECRET//COM1NT//20291123\n\n\fTOP\n\nSECRET//COMINT//2029II23\n\n(TS'/SI) For example, the databases F O U R S C O R l : and Z A P\ncontain both N S A FISA and FBI FISA thai docs not carry ihc\nappropriate classification (all NSA and FBI FISA material\nmust carry the \"TS/ZSl-lICl RGT//NOFORNfV2029123^\nclassification. FBI FISA should also be marked with the\nOGC-approvcd FBI FISA banncrj Further, NSA FISA and\nFBI FISA materials arc mixed together within the databases,\ndespite the differences in allowed retention between the Iwo\nversions of FISA, and both arc mixed with non-FISA\nmaterial. CHS should also provide SV with an SOP clarifying\nhow access (by both CCS and S2 target analysts) to these\ntarget folders is maintained, including what checks are m\nplace to verify user clearances to view NSA FISA and/or FBI\nFJSA material.\n(TS//S1) If you support access in principle. 1 would\nrecommend that no action be taken to establish accounts at the\nCCs for these CES databases until SV can ensure that the\nissues of classification, partitioning and access are resolved\nand any existing FISA access or retention violations are\nidentified and clcarcd up.\n(TS//SI) Further, SV recommends tliat this access not be\napproved until S3/CES and the Crvptologic Centers involved\ncoordinate with the offices that sponsored the N S A FISA\ncourt orders and agree to the responsibilities that cach will\nhave relative to satisfying the FISA minimization procedures\n(USSID SPOOl 8, Annex A). This is ncccssary to ensure thai\nall individuals who touch NSA FISA material personally\nabide by N S A ' s FISA handling and minimization\nrequirements, ensure that no one makes erroneous\nassumptions about what another office is doing vis-a-vis\nmeeting those requirements, and ensure that the NSA\ndeclarant can swear under oath that N S A abides by its\nobligations.\n\nTOP\n\nSECRET//COMINT//2Q291123\n\n\f",

This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classification instructions,\nwhile classification guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an NSAlCSS FISAlProtect America Act\n(PAA)IFISA Amendments Act (FAA) classification guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will\nreference an NSAlCSS FISAlPAAlFAA classification guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by\nthe FISC. Also, this document references classification guidelines for FISAIPAAlF AA information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information\n(ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classification. Additional Annexes are\nprovided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.\n(TS//SI/INF) The markings \"TSP\" and \"Compartmented\" were at times used in briefing materials and documentation associated with the\nSTELLAR WIND program. \"TSP\" and \"Compartmented\" were used primarily by the National Security Agency (NSA) Legislative Affairs Office\n(LAO), NSA Office of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in briefings and declarations intended for external audiences, such as\nCongress and the courts. The term \"TSP\" was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//ORCONINOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRETIISIJ/ORCONINOFORN\n\nPresident in December 2005.

The below column is unclassified in its\nentirety.\n\nDear Zelda,\n\nHere's the scenario: when the boss sees co-workers having a quiet conversation, he wants to know what\nis being said (it's mostly work related). He has his designated \"snitches\" and expects them to keep him\napprised of all the office gossip -- even calling them at home and expecting a run-down! This puts the\n\"designees\" in a really awkward position; plus, we're all afraid any offhand comment or anything said\nin confidence might be either repeated or misrepresented.\n\nNeedless to say, this creates a certain amount of tension between team members who normally would\nget along well, and adds stress in an already stressful atmosphere. There is also an unspoken belief that\nhe will move people to different desks to break up what he perceives as people becoming too\n\"chummy.\" (It's been done under the guise of \"creating teams.\")\n\nWe used to be able to joke around a little or talk about our favorite \"Idol\" contestant to break the\ntension, but now we're getting more and more skittish about even the most mundane general\nconversations (\"Did you have a good This was once a very open, cooperative group who\nworked well together. Now we're more suspicious of each other and teamwork is becoming harder. Do\nyou think this was the goal?\n\nSilenced in SID\n\nDear Silenced,\nWow, that takes \"intelligence collection\" in a whole new -- and inappropriate -- direction!\nIt's lonely at the top\n\nFirst let me say that I do not think this manager's intent is to discourage teamwork. What it sounds like\nto me is that he (I'll call him \"Michael\") feels like an outsider and wants to be in the know. It can be\nlonely being the boss. You sit closed off in an office and miss the easy camaraderie with your co-\nworkers, while at the same time feeling the need to \"police\" their behavior. Maybe someone told\nMichael there was too much chit-chat in his organization or that some specific problem existed, and\nresorting to snitches is his misguided way of ferreting out the culprit(s). Either that or he's been\nwatching too much \"Law and Order.\"\n\nWhy don't you try this: go overboard communicating with him. Call him over when he's wandering\naround spying on people and fill him in on things. Give him details of work projects and ask his\n\nopinion about mission matters so he feels like he's 1n the loop.\" Get others to drop by his desk\nperiodically just to say hello, \"hope you had a good weekend,\" or \"How 'bout them I bet that will\n\nsatisfy his need to know what's going on and he'll back off with the nosiness.\nSecrets Allowed\n\nWe work in an Agency of secrets, but this kind of secrecy begets more secrecy and it becomes a\ndownward spiral that destroys teamwork. What if you put an end to all the secrecy by bringing it out\ninto the open? You and your co-workers could ask Michael for a team meeting and lay out the issue as\nyou see it: \"We feel like you don't trust us and we aren't comfortable making small talk anymore for\nfear of having our desks moved if we're seen as being too chummy.\" (Leave out the part about the\nsnitches.) Tell him how this is hampering collaboration and affecting the workproblem with the team's behavior, and see what he says. Encourage him to come directly to the\nemployee in question if he has a concern (rather than ask a third party to gather intel for him). In any\ncase, the meeting will clear the air. Stick to the facts and how you feel, rather than making it about him\n(\"We're uncomfortable\" vs. \"You're spying on \n\nIf, after your attempts to bring things out in the open, it becomes clear that Michael is simply evil\n(some people live to stir up trouble), your best recourse may be to approach Michael's boss with the\nproblem and perhaps Michael can be reassigned. Be sure to focus on the effect it's having on the team's\nwork when you talk to his manager.\n\nNo one likes a tattle-tale\n\n\"Silenced\" implied that in this situation the snitches were unwilling accomplices for Michael. The\nreluctant snitches feel like they're \"damned if they do and damned if they don't,\" and everyone else is\nwalking on eggshells. If you are bothered by snitches in your office, whether of the unwilling or\nvoluntary variety, the best solution is to keep your behavior above reproach. Be a good performer,\nwatch what you say and do, lock your screen when you step away from your workstation, and keep\nfodder for wagging tongues (your Viagra stash, photos of your wild-and-crazy girls' weekend in\nAtlantic City) at home or out of sight. If you are put in the \"unwilling snitch\" position, I would advise\ntelling your boss that you're not comfortable with the role and to please not ask that of you.\n\nTrust is hard to rebuild once it has been broken. Your work center may take time to heal after this\ndeplorable practice is discontinued, but give it time and hopefully the open cooperation you once\n\nenjoyed will return.\n\nzelda\n\nEditor's note: Have thoughts on this topic? Post them on the associated Tapioca Pebble.\n\nStandard disclaimer: \"Zelda's\" views are her own and do not represent the official views of\nthe Associate Directorate for Corporate Leadership, Human Resources, SID, or any other NSA\norganization.\n\n",

    "doc_text": "(U) ''Ask Zelda!'': Guilty Until Proven Innocent?\nFROM: ''Zelda,'' Dispenser of Advice on Workplace Issues\nRun Date: 11/08/2012\n(U) The below article is unclassified in its entirety.\nNote: The following question has been edited for brevity.\nDear Zelda,\nHow do I exonerate myself from an \"anonymous mailbag\" incident?\nA few months ago, a co-worker was really steamed about how things were going in our branch/division\nand wrote a livid message to our office's \"anonymous mailbag,\" but showed a few of us the draft\nbeforehand. I suggested that the wording was overly strong, as it referred to our managers as \"abysmal\"\nand \"idiotic.\" The co-worker sent it anyway.\nCo-worker receives praise and recognition from the office, despite the mail or because co-worker didn't\ncome up on the list of suspects who wrote the message. In the meantime, the chill I'm feeling is pretty\nsevere! I'm known to be a direct person, so possibly it was assumed that if anyone would write a\nmessage like that, I would; but I didn't, and I advised against it.\nBecause I agreed to look at the draft in confidence, I don't want to dime out my co-worker. What\nrecourse do I have to officially establish that I have not used this mailbag? If I have something to say to\nanyone, I'll do it under my own name, and it won't involve using the words \"abysmal\" or \"idiotic.\"\nHelp!!!!!\nAnd BTW, to me the situation I'm in is a good argument against \"anonymous mailbags.\" Let people put\ntheir own names to criticisms they want to make of others. Otherwise, you end up with people like me\nwho are wondering if we're getting unjustly blamed.\n– Innocent Bystander\n\nDear Bystander,\nYou make a good case against anonymous mailbags, but a lot of people won't give feedback at all if\nthey know it will be attributed to them. I believe scathing comments such as your co-worker's are the\nexception and not the rule in such mailbags.\nNevertheless, there is something you can do about the situation. Speak to the person(s) who is freezing\nyou out. In private say, \"I've notice you . . . [describe the treatment you're receiving]. Have I done\nsomething to offend you?\"\nIf they mention \"your\" note, you have the opening to set the record straight. You can state what you did\nabove -- that you have never used the mailbag and that if you had something to say to someone, you\n\n\fwould tell them directly 'cause that's how you roll.\nIf they don't bring up the note, at least you've made an attempt to clear the air. Maybe there is another\nreason for the cold shoulder. When they insist nothing is wrong, you could say something like, \"I hope\nif you did have a problem with me, that you would talk to me directly about it. I would do the same for\nyou.\" That plants the seeds of innocence in their mind (i.e., you would talk to them directly and not use\nan anonymous mailbag) if the cause is the note, and encourages them to broach the subject if it's\nsomething else.\nOther \"Anonymous Mailbag\" Thoughts\nWhile it is tempting to be completely uncensored when using anonymous feedback mechanisms, please\nunderstand that it can be counterproductive. A rude, accusatory, or overly severe comment can turn the\nrecipient off to your suggestion for improvement. Try to make your comment constructive and free\nfrom emotional coloring. You are more likely to have it considered and initiate change that way.\nLikewise, if you receive hostile feedback through an anonymous mailbag, it's easy to discount and\nignore it, especially if it pushes your \"hot\" buttons. Instead, try to look past the way it is worded to see\nif there's a kernel of truth that requires action. Often important feedback is not couched in the most\npleasant terms. While many people will accept gentle criticism from a friend, it takes a truly\nenlightened person to acknowledge that an adversary's nasty comment might have some merit and to do\nsomething about it.\n\n(U) Standard disclaimer: Zelda's views are her own and do not represent the official views of the\nAssociate Directorate for Corporate Leadership, Human Resources, SID, or any other NSA\norganization.\n(U) Looking for some of the older \"Ask Zelda\" columns? They are filed away in the archives under the\n\"Ask Zelda! 2010\" and \"Ask Zelda 2011\" series.

    "doc_text": "(U) An Interview with Zelda\nFROM: SIDtoday\nRun Date: 05/05/2011\n(U) With the first anniversary of the \"Ask Zelda\" column looming on the horizon (in June), we decided\nto interview Zelda herself. We thought her readers might be interested in learning more about the\nadvice-giver...\n(U) SIDtoday: Zelda, your advice column \"Ask Zelda\" has been the most successful non-technical\nseries in the history of SIDtoday. A lot of people have questioned whether Zelda is a real person or a\nteam of people, and why she uses a pen name.\n(U) Zelda: Well, as you can see, I'm a real person. In the first issue you published my \"credentials,\" and\nthat description was accurate; but the picture that runs with the column [above] looks nothing like me.\nAs for Zelda being a team of people, I do occasionally consult with another person for a \"sanity check,\"\nbut I am the sole author of the column.\n(U) The decision to use a pen name came about for several reasons. The idea for the column was\nproposed by the SIDtoday editor, who was looking for a venue where SID supervisors could write in to\nask advice. Since SIDtoday is like an online newspaper, we decided to follow the tradition of\nnewspaper write-in advice columnists (such as Dear Abby and Miss Manners) and give me a nom de\nplume. I like it because using a pen name creates a persona who's more memorable and accessible than\n\"Ask Mary Smith, Chief of S456.\" Plus it creates a certain mystique about Zelda... she's bigger than\nlife. It also prevents me from getting inundated with hate mail and requests for advice outside of the\ncolumn. [Ed. note: Some people have asked for Zelda's direct help with a personal problem but didn't\nwant it published in SIDtoday.]\n(U) ST: You said it was an advice column for supervisors...\n(U) Z: Yes -- that was the original plan. But non-supervisory employees began writing in asking\nquestions and requesting someone like Zelda help them with their issues, too.\n(U) ST: So you branched out to answer anything work related?\n(U) Z: [laughs] More or less! I don't give technical or romantic advice, however.\n(U) ST: What has been the reaction to Zelda?\n(U) Z: I'm very pleased-- and surprised -- that it has been overwhelmingly positive. Each month it is\namong the top 5 most widely read articles, and I want to thank my loyal followers for that. I'm thinking\nof making little rubber bracelets that say WWZD (\"What Would Zelda Do?\") to give out at Front Line\nLeader classes. Or maybe t-shirts that say \"Be a FOZ\" (\"Friend of Zelda\").\n(U) ST: But it hasn't all been positive...\n(U//FOUO) Z: Heavens, no. There have been a few people who didn't appreciate Zelda's sense of\nhumor, and at first some of the other NSA organizations (like HR and ADCL) were uncomfortable with\n\n\fan unknown person in SID dispensing advice in their areas of expertise. But we made it clear that this\nwas just Zelda's opinion and not an official answer. Strict policy questions can and should be addressed\nby these other organizations, but Zelda fills a void for people who are seeking advice. She acts as a\nwise friend or senior co-worker -- which isn't the same thing as asking for a policy interpretation. And\nmany areas of interpersonal relations can't be addressed by policy. I don't believe there's a policy on\nhow to deal with an obnoxious or smelly coworker, for example. Besides, I think people would rather\nread something with a bit of a personality (Zelda has been called \"cheeky\" -- even opinionated) as\nopposed to a bland, whitewashed party line that reads like a policy manual and has been approved by a\nchain of managers to scrub it of anything that might offend. Zelda is not afraid to offend -- although\nthat's not her intent.\n(U) ST: Some readers are probably wondering if the questions are really sent in by your readers, or\nif you make them up.\n(U) Z: They were all from readers except for the very first one -- I had to \"prime the pump\" since no\none knew about Zelda to ask questions before the first article came out. Also, in December I turned the\ntables on the workforce and asked them to give advice on a situation of my choosing.\n(U) ST: How do you decide which questions to answer?\n(U) Z: I try to address a variety of topics, so if you write in about a specific problem and I just\nanswered a similar question, yours probably won't get published.... at least not for a while. Also, some\nquestions are more appropriate for the policy expert in that area to answer. In that case, SIDtoday\nforwards the question (with the asker's permission) to that POC.\n(U) ST: What issues do you see people concerned about most?\n(U) Z: How to deal with their supervisor is a big one. I devoted a whole article to \"managing up\"\nbecause several readers had asked similar questions along those lines.\n(U) ST: Is there an underlying theme or philosophy that ties all your advice together?\n(U) Z: Hmmm, if I had to pick something, I might say \"common sense.\" Also, be nice to people and\nassume noble intent.\n(U) ST: What one piece of advice do you have for SID managers?\n(U) Z: Throughout my career I've seen too many micro-managers. It's probably inevitable -- we hire\npeople for their technical skills, and then when they get to a certain level they find they need to go into\nmanagement to keep getting promoted. However, they still have a secret hankering to do the technical\nwork. Managers need to be open minded: just because the organization has always done something a\ncertain way doesn't mean it's the only -- or even best -- way to do it. My advice to SID managers is to\ntake care of your people and let your people take care of the mission.\n(U) ST: One last question: will the readers ever find out who Zelda really is?\n(U) Z: I don't know... Probably when the column wraps-up, whenever that may be. Doing it too soon\nmight be disappointing -- like unmasking the Lone Ranger!\n\n\f",

(Topic: 'Is Bain de Soleil a Bane on\nNSA??')\nFROM: 'Zelda,' Dispenser of Advice for NSA Supervisors\nRun Date: 06/15/2010\n(U) SIDtoday editor's note: Today we debut a brand new column: \"Ask Zelda!\" If you, as a supervisor,\nencounter a tricky problem and don't know what to do, see whether Zelda can offer a solution! Here's a\nlittle background about our columnist:\n\"Zelda\" is the pen name for a manager who has spent most of her 29 years at NSA in SID (and its\npredecessor orgs), supplemented by several years in career development (ADET). Her managerial\nexperience includes approximately 20 years as a first-line and mid-level Agency supervisor, as well as\nsupervisory positions in the entertainment and food service industries. Zelda develops and teaches\nleadership training as part of the National Cryptologic School's Adjunct Faculty, and enjoys bossing\npeople around outside of work, too.\nToday's question (the entire text below is unclassified):\nDear Zelda,\nNow that the warm weather is here, some of the newer Agency employees in my office are dressing in\nways that are less than professional. How do I, as their supervisor, get them to stop dressing like they're\ngoing to the beach when NSA doesn't have a formal dress code?\nSigned,\nPrudish Prudence\n\nDear Prudence,\nOy! Once the thermometer hits 80 degrees, it can look like Ocean City West around here. Somehow,\nshorts and flip-flops don't exactly convey the image of a fierce SIGINT warrior.\nYou are right to be concerned, and I applaud your initiative as the supervisor to take corrective action.\nNot only is beach attire unprofessional in the workplace, but in certain cases it can be downright\ndistracting to co-workers (if you get my drift).\nThe main thing to remember when counseling the offending employees is that they probably don't\nknow any better. For some, this may be their first real job after graduating high school or college. Your\napproach should be to educate, not to discipline (unless you have already \"educated\" them more than\nonce and there has been no change in behavior). Hold a private counseling session as soon as possible\nwhere you explain that, while NSA has no formal dress code, they are expected to present themselves\nin a professional manner -- and that includes their attire. You may also want to take the opportunity to\nadvise them on \"dressing for success\" so that they are taken seriously in their new career. In fact, it\nmight be a good idea to have this talk with all new Agency employees, informing them of the standard\nlevel of office dress before it becomes an issue.\n\n\fYou, as the supervisor, are in a position to set guidelines for what is appropriate in your work center.\nBoth the physical location and type of work being done will help you determine what these should be.\nIf safety is a concern (like when operating dangerous equipment), impress upon them the importance of\nwearing steel-toed boots or long-sleeved shirts, even if they make one hot in the summer. What may be\nacceptable for employees working on the roof, in an overheated machine room, or crawling under floor\ntiles is probably not appropriate for desk job workers in an air-conditioned office. Do your employees\nfill a customer liaison role or one where they represent the organization to others? That may require a\nmore formal level of dress than solitary workers who rarely interact with others.\nOn the other hand, you must balance your demands with the employee's physical comfort and the\ndesire to express one's individuality. Remember that embracing diversity extends to the wardrobe, too!\nSo, Prudence, to summarize my advice:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nDecide what is appropriate for your work center -- and try to be inclusive.\nInform your employees what the office dress code is and why (I find people are more likely to\ncomply with rules if they understand the reasons behind them).\nAsk them for specific behavioral changes (ex.: they are welcome to wear sandals at work, but\nplease refrain from wearing rubber shower thongs in the office).\nAnswer any questions and address their concerns.\nThank them for their cooperation.\nEnforce the rules equitably among your people.\n\nAs with most things, communication is the key to a happy and productive workplace. With a little\nproactive discussion on your part, your staff can look professional during the summer months. So the\nnext time one of your employees looks like they work at the National Snorkeling Academy instead of\nthe National Security Agency, try these tips and let me know how it turns out.\n\nNote: Other supervisors who have successfully handled this problem are encouraged to share their\nstrategies on the SIDtoday Blog. Also, do you have a question of your own for Zelda? Use the\n\"comments/suggestions about this article\" link (below right) to submit your question; we'll make sure it\ngets to Zelda.\n\n\f",

If there is a 51%+ confidence that it is a foreign malicious method and no other\ninformation contradicts that theory, you may task with no defeats. Otherwise, defeat(s) or other selectors are required to minimize potential\nUS/FVEYs hackers. No querying may be made to 'prove US origin' of hacking activity. There must be evidence/information that suggest it is\nforeign. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Known foreign malicious actor\nAre any defeats needed when querying against a Known foreign malicious actor?\nNo defeats are needed when it is a known foreign malicious actor. (Source #002)\nNOC RESPONSE: If the foreign IP is consistently associated with malicious cyber activity against the U.S., so. tied to a foreign individual or\norganization known to direct malicious activity our way. then there is no need to defeat any to. from, or about U.S. Persons. This is based on the\ndescription that one end of the communication would always be this suspect foreign IP. and so therefore any U.S. Person communicant would be\nincidental to the foreign intelligence task. In fact, you would very likely see a U.S. Person in the \"TO\" as a victim of spear-phishing or other\ncampaigns, or as a \"FROM\" for beaconing or exfiltration activity. If. however, you believe there is a circumstance where the task will give you U.S.\nPersons at both ends, then IVe misunderstood the description and would need more information. (Source #003)\nOGC RESPONSE: OGC agrees. Please note that any USP collection obtained via targeting the selector will constitute incidental collection and any\nUSP information would need to be minimized per USSID 18. Also, please be aware that any targeting of a foreign selector solely for the purpose of\nobtaining USP comms. constitute improper reverse targeting. (Source #003)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Two-way FVEYs defeat\nIs it a free-for-all when using a two-way FVEYs defeat?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: YES. no problem. (Source #001)\nAs a clarification though...querying on a known US/FVEYs selector (even with defeats) will still be reported as a violation. Example, querying on a\nUS person's name, email address. IP address, etc. Even though you would receive 0 results...you still targeted a US person.\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Unknowingly targeting a US person\nI screwed up...the selector had a strong indication of being foreign, but it turned out to be US...now what?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: With all querying, if you discover it actually is US. then it must be submitted and go in the OGC quarterly report...'but it's\nnothing to worry about\". (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Potential for US-US comms\nI'm still worried about a selector in which I don't have 100% confidence of it's foreignness...95% confident for the sake of argument. But, I\ndon't want to miss out on potential communication by using a FVEYs defeat. What happens if My selector ends up being US, and I\npotentially get US to US comms?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: The SIGINT system does not have the capability to collect US-US comms. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Targeting an un-registered URI\nWhile reversing a piece of malware that came into NIPRNet, we come across a call-back to an unregistered URI. We do not know\nforeignness nor server location it will eventually resolve to. What are our options in tasking that selector?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: If there is no information to suggest it is a legitimate US used site, assume foreign. If at all possible, use selectors to just\nfocus on activity (i.e. a specific URL or file name). If you discover it actually is US. then it must be submitted and go into OGC's quarterly\nreport...but it's nothing to worry about. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Randomly generated URIs\nWe frequently run across randomly generated URI in malware, DNS lookups, get request, etc. Given that the randoms indicates\nobfuscation, and obfuscation many times indicates malicious intent...what are our targeting options?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: Random looking URIs can be treated as malicious unless there is contradictory information otherwise. Same applies to the\nforeignness of said URI...assume foreignness unless there is contradictory information otherwise. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Querying against US systems\nMany foreign actors utilize US based servers/services for things like Facebook, GMail, Twitter, etc. If we 'know' a foreign actors\nscreename/login for said US service, can we query for related traffic to/from the said US server?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: If they are a foreign target using the account from a foreign location, then it may be fine. But if you're actually having to\ntarget the Twitter server more broadly, then probably not. NSA may target via EO 12333 a DNI selector which is confirmed foreign. (Source #003)\nOkay to use XKS micro-plugins (for example) that query against Facebook. GMail. Twitter, etc. IF screename/username is believed to be foreign.\nThis is sticky though, if you 'guess' foreign and it's not. then it is a serious violation. Try to minimize to 'post' for example to filter out non-pertinent\ncomms. (Source #001)\nNOC response: Yes. you may task that domain if it was established for and used only by the foreign target, believed to be operating from an\noverseas location. If there is any possibility that others had previously established or could currently be using the domain, then your task must\ninclude an \"and\" that defeats any known U.S. Person use of the site and limits the task to only the communications that would be generated by the\nforeign targeted group via that domain. So if there is an entry port or protocol unique to the group, that would be an appropriate \"and\". Once tasked,\nif the collection reveals activity by U.S. Persons that is not simply incidental to the foreign intelligence task, than additional defeats must be\nimplemented. If there is no foreign intelligence activity as expected, you would have to de-task. (Source #003)\n\nEven though XYZcommuncation in Chicago may 'own' the equipment, a foreign actor may be 'leasing' space. What is the determining\nfactor for 'foreign'?\nNOC response: I don't know the full realm of possibilities here, but you must have either intelligence, law enforcement, commercial, or open source\ninformation denoting that the establishment and use of that webspace is by the foreign target. (Source #003)\nOGC response: OGC agrees. However, it is essential that the TOPI be able to establish the foreignness of the webspace and that the defeats are\nsufficient to prevent any overcollect. (Source #003)\nSince we can do the above, what proof would we need of the leaser being foreign...just the domain registration info from open source?\nNOC response: If the registration information is explicit enough to link to your foreign target, this should be adequate. Otherwise, you'll need\nadditional corroborating information. (Source #003)\nOGC response: OGC agrees. (Source #003)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Targeting foreign 'members' of a group\nIs it okay to target the foreign actors of a loosely coupled group of hackers...such as with Anonymous? For instance, Anonymous has a\n'branch' in Brazil, India, Germany, etc. Can we target those individuals?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: As long as they are foreign individuals outside of the US and do not hold dual citizenship...then you are okay.

Examples: WikiLeaks, thepiratebay.org, etc.\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: Let us get back to you. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Storing 'leaked' US data on government systems\nCan we store leaked information (such as from the hacker group Anonymous) on government systems for the purpose of analyzing the\ndata for clues as to the method of the breach?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: If it's DOD/.mil (and not classified data), it's okay, otherwise no. (Source #001)\nNEED FOLLOW-UP: what about .gov data???\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Querying on foreign IPs obtained from home\nIf we run across foreign malicious actors at home (spam email, router/IDS logs, torrent sites, etc) can we bring those IPs here and use the\nSIGINT system to monitor these guys?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: It might be okay, but wait for confirmation. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Foreign servers in which US persons 'might' be using\nIs it okay to query against a foreign server known to be malicious even if there is a possibility that US persons could be using it as well?\nExample, thepiratebay.org.\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: Okay to go after foreign servers which US people use also (with no defeats). But try to minimize to 'post' only for example\nto filter out non-pertinent information. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) US server being used for foreign malware call-back\nIn some instances, foreign malware has a know US server as it's call-back. If we are fairly confident that the URI pointing to the said US\nserver is operated by a foreign actor, can we query for that traffic?\nNOC/OGC RESPONSE: If you are more than 50% confident that it is foreign origin. OKAY. Also minimize any potential US legit comms. Also use\nURI as selector, not IP as server may host multiple domains (some of which could be US domains). If you discover that you are wrong in lessor of\nsaid server, then it must be submitted and go into OGC's quarterly report. (Source #001)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Tracking foreign actors bouncing through US proxies\n[when an actor is]...posting to thepiratebay.org (a foreign web server)...through multiple proxied hops, are we allowed to back-trace that\ncommunication even if it hops through US based proxies? In other words, back-trace the post from thepiratebay.org to a Chinese base\nproxy which came through a US based proxy, which came through another US based proxy, which came through a Russian based proxy,\netc.\nNOC RESPONSE: Assuming you mean via SIGINT metadata, then SPCMA-trained analysts would be able to use SPCMA-enabled tools to chain\notherwise.\n\n(Source\n\n#003)\n\nURL r e d a c t e d\n\nOGC RESPONSE: OGC agrees with the above discussion regarding metadata. (Source #003)\nNOTE: V252 has now been given the authority to gain SPCMA access/tools. Analyst should obtain SPCMA training and download the appropriate\nSPCMA enabled tool in order to achieve the goal in the question stated above. [PUT LINK TO PAGE HERE]\nCan we task XKS-SIGINT for communication between 2 US IP addresses if we know the ports associated with a proxy running between\nthem being used for malicious foreign activity?\nNOC RESPONSE: If you know the ports associated with the proxy you're targeting are only used for that purpose, then you can target the IP\naddresses \"and\" the ports to only return the malicious foreign activity being conducted via those IP addresses. (Source #003)\nOGC RESPONSE: However. OGC will need further clarification before signing off on targeting 2 US IP addresses. (Source #003)\nSince we can do the above, what level of effort and justification would we provide to filter out US communication? Could we simply use a\n4-tuple (the two US IP address on either end along with the port numbers that the proxy is running over) with a justification that it was\nbeing used by a foreign power at that moment in time?\nNOC RESPONSE: If the 4-tuple task already effectively limits the collection to the foreign intelligence target, than yes. But if your tasking could\nalso result in domestic collection (U.S. to U.S.). then additional defeats or tasking parameters are necessary, perhaps adding a time frame to limit\ncollection to \"that moment in time\" when you expect the activity to occur. (Source #003)\nOGC RESPONSE: OGC agrees and defers to SV regarding the specific filtering requirements. (Source #003)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Password == US person?\nDoes a password correspond to a US person. [If a] list of .mil passwords [were] released to thepiratebay.org...can we go back into XKSSIGINT (using a custom created fingerprint) to search for traffic containing that password in foreign traffic just before the release?\nNOC RESPONSE: Normally a password would not be considered equivalent to a U.S. person, since it is not necessarily unique to any one\nindividual, but in this case, we will have an equivalency record (as will the public!), so I am not sure of the legality from that standpoint. But more\nimportantly, the tasking of the passwords in this case is consistent with the SIGINT Consensual Collection package signed by Cmdr.\nUSCYBERCOM and DIRNSA. appropriate to both of his hats. Refer to this document for full context:\n¡ 0 . (Source #003)\nOGC RESPONSE: OGC agrees. (Source #003)\n\nURL r e d a c t e d\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Botnet on US box, foreign actor\nIf we have evidence that malicious activity is originating from an US IP via a foreign controlled botnet, can we target that IP using the\nbotnets port number (thus filtering out any US citizen communication)?\nNOC RESPONSE: Yes. you would only be collecting the foreign target's use of the U.S. IP in this case, with the appropriate filters C'ands\").\n(Source #003)\nOGC RESPONSE: Again, it is critical that foreignness is established and that there is effective filtering. (Source #003)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Definition of Malicious Activity\nIn reference to the many queastions above, please define 'malicious activity'. Malware server, C&C node, responsible for attacks against a\nUS system, a site containing US persons passwords and other confidential data, a site containing .mil passwords/data, etc?\nNOC RESPONSE: The DJP-maintained Cyber Lexicon does not define \"malicious activity\", so will have to table that for now. But the activity\nyou've described clearly constitutes a security threat to National Security Systems.\nOGC RESPONSE: OGC agrees.\n\n[edit] (S//SI//REL) Using SIGINT system for defensive means?\nExample: Can we query XKS-SIGINT using a DOD IP address as the selector to look for foreign targets?\nUnanswered at this point.\n\n[edit] (S//SI//REL) SPCMA: Query against US selector\n(S//SI//REL) When querying with a SPCMA enabled tool (i.e. Synapse Workbench) against a US selector (i.e. an IP address), what are\nsome scenarios that would be considered \"Foreign Intelligence purposes\"? Based upon the link|\nI\n\nURL r e d a c t e d\n\nwe can query the said US selector \"regardless of the known or unknown\nforeignness of the communicants\". Is this a scenario where we are able to query/chain through comms, but must simply de-task if it is\nrevealed to be US origin?\n(S//SI//REL) EXAMPLE: We have an US IP hitting the NIPRNet with an attack. That attack could very well have a foreign actor behind it,\nutilizing that US box as a last hop. But it could just as easily be a US person hitting us...we have no idea. Can we assume it is a foreign\nactor until we have evidence to the contrary? If chaining back through the link (utilizing a SPCMA tool) reveals a US source (as opposed\n\nto foreign), do we simply de-task, or would that incidental targeting of a US person need to be reported to you guys as well?\nNOC RESPONSE: (S//SI//REL) If SPCMA analysis reveals a U.S. actor behind an intrusion, then per SPCMA guidance \"Existing rules for\ncollection and dissemination of US person information are unchanged by the Supplemental Procedures.\" Therefore, you would de-task the U.S.\nactor (if previously tasked vs. incidentally discovered), and this would be a reportable incident. However, if not previously tasked, the discovery of\nthis U.S. Person would be incidental to a legitimate foreign intelligence task and therefore discovery via authorized SPCMA chaining is not an\nincident. (Source #005)\n\n[edit] (TS//SI//REL) Querying on Case Notation\nXKS-SIGINT queries being made with a 'case notation' as the selector. There are two scenarios...\n1) An XKS query being made with only one or more case notations and a time range (typically in days and always exceeding 2 hours)\nbeing used as selectors.\n2) A query being made with a case notation selector AND a minimal amount of effort to narrow down the query...such as looking for\nexecutables only - see example #2 below.\nIn neither case, are there any sort of FVEYs defeats, timeframe limitations (such as a 2 hour window), nor 'malicious' fingerprints being\nused. And in case it matters...these are typically Cyberquest personal at remote field sites whose tasking includes survey work such as\ncharacterizing links for possible SIGINT value. If BLACKPEARL shows the case notation/link to be foreign (Saudi Arabia, Denmark, etc.)\nis that justification enough to query on that case notation alone with no other defeats?\nNOC RESPONSE: For the purpose of characterization activity, the queries are supportable, given the confirmation from BLACKPEARL that the\ncase notations are foreign. A case notation is also considered a strong selector and any additional limiters would be more to restrict the volume of\nthe return than anything else. Although not recommended for sustained collection, but are fine for survey purposes: consistent with the mission\nbeing worked by the Cyberquest personnel.

Statement\nA kidnapper based in a rural area travels to an urban area to\nmake ransom calls\ncan’t risk bringing attention to low-population rural area\nwon’t use phone for any other comms (or uses payphones ...)\n\nAssumption: He has another device that accesses IP\nnetworks from public access points\nhaving a device isn’t necessary, could use internet cafes, libraries etc.\nhe is also assumed to use IP access around the time of ransom calls\n\nQuestion: Knowing the time of the ransom calls can we\ndiscover the kidnapper’s IP ID/device\n“contact chain” across air-gap (not a correlation of selectors)\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nSolution Outline\nWith earlier IP profiling analytics, we can “sweep” a\ncity/region to discover and determine public accesses\nWe can then select which IP network IDs are seen as active\nin all times surrounding the known ransom calls\nreduce set to a shortlist\n\nThen we examine the reduced set of IP network IDs and\neliminate baseline heavy users in the area that fall into the\nset intersection just because they are always active\nthat is, eliminate those that are highly active outside the times of the ransom\ncalls\nhopefully leaves only the one needle from the haystack\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nFirst Proof-of-Concept\nSwept a modest size city and discovered two high traffic\npublic access ranges with >300,000 active IDs over 2 weeks\nused for initial expediency due to computational intensity\n\nPresumed that there were 3 ransom calls, each 50 hours\napart during daytime, looked for IDs within 1 Hr of calls\nreduce large set to a shortlist of just 19 IP network IDs\n\nExamined activity level of 19 IP network IDs – how many\npresences each had in 1 Hr slots over two weeks\nmain worry as the computation was running: there would be a lot of IDs that\nshowed just a handful of appearances: e.g. 3, 4, 5 instances\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nID Presence of Shortlist\nEach horizontal line shows presence of ID over time/hour-slots\n\nTime/hour-slots →\n\nPostulated presence of kidnapper/target\n\nHappy result: least active ID had appearances in 40 hour-slots!\nThus could eliminate all, leaving just the kidnapper (if he was there)\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nBig-Data Computational Challenge\nAll the previous analytics, while successful experimentally,\nran much too slowly to allow for practical productization\nCARE: Collaborative Analytics Research Environment\na big-data system being trialed at CSEC (with NSA launch assist)\nnon-extraordinary hardware\nminimal impedance between memory, storage and processors\nhighly optimized, in-memory database capabilities\ncolumnar storage, high performance vector functional runtime\npowerful but challenging programming language (derived from APL)\n\nResult of first experiments with CARE: game-changing\nrun-time for hop-profiles reduced from 2+ Hrs to several seconds\nallows for tradecraft to be profitably productized\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nOverall Summary\nIP profiling showing terrific value\nsignificant analytic asset for IP networks and target mobility\nenables critical capability within Tipping & Cueing Task force\nworking to productize on powerful new computational platform\nbroader SSO accesses/apertures coming online at CSEC\nlook to formalize models & fold-in timing deltas\n\nA new needle-in-a-haystack analytic is viable: contact\nchaining across air-gaps\nenabled by sweep capability of IP profiling\nshould test further to understand robustness with respect to loosening\nassumptions of target behaviour\nbeyond kidnapping, tradecraft could also be used for any target that makes\noccasional forays into other cities/regions\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET\n\nTradecraft Studio Example\n\nPossible route for productizing analytics\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": "(U) UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen -- Will the Developed and Developing\nWorld Agree on Climate Change?\nFROM:\nDeputy SINIO for Economics and Global Issues (S17)\nRun Date: 12/07/2009\n(U) Delegates from around the world will convene in Copenhagen from 7 to 18 December for the\nUN Climate Change Conference (COP-15). The event is intended to be the culmination of two\nyears of negotiations by the international community to reach consensus on legally binding\ncommitments to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would enter into force in 2012, when\nthe first phase of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change expires. Over 90 world leaders, including\nthe U.S. President, are expected to participate. In Copenhagen, these leaders will attempt to reach\nan agreement that both launches immediate action and ensures long-term commitments. However,\nit remains to be seen if an agreement will be reached or whether negotiations will break down\nentirely. Success or failure will have far-reaching effects in the areas of foreign policy,\nenvironmental issues, and energy security.\n(U) Reaching a global climate-change agreement will not be easy for the delegates. The greatest\nchallenge to the talks remains the North-South divide. The leaders from the North -- i.e., developed\ncountries -- see climate change as a problem with irreversible consequences that cannot be solved\nwithout the full participation of developing countries, especially emerging market economies. The\nleaders from the South -- or developing countries, led by China and India -- see the climate change\nproblem as not of their making and believe they are being asked to fix it in ways which will hamper\ntheir ability to raise their standards of living.\n(U) These divisions are deep, with both sides showing few signs of compromise. During the\nopening session of preliminary negotiations in Barcelona last month, the 50-member Africa Group,\nin a show of unity, walked out, announcing that they would boycott the Kyoto Protocol talks until\ndeveloped countries got serious about their climate change commitments. They ended their boycott\nof the talks after winning promises for more in-depth talks on how much developed countries need\nto reduce GHG emissions.\n(U) To move the process forward, it will be necessary to bridge this divide. There are efforts\nunderway to do this, including the Franco-Brazilian common position, which aims to reduce GHG\nemissions globally by at least 50 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. In a mid-November statement\nto the press, Presidents Sarkozy and Lula emphasized that they hoped to demonstrate that two\ncountries with different national and regional situations can successfully adopt a joint position on\nclimate change. Meanwhile, the Danes, as host of the event, are tirelessly engaging world leaders to\ngarner support for their draft political agreement - which was created when it became clear that the\nprocess had run out of time to reach agreement on a legally binding treaty. Supporters of this\napproach hope the political agreement will subsequently be transformed into a legally binding\nclimate treaty sometime next year.\n(TSIISIHREL) Analysts here at NSA, as well as our Second Party partners, will continue to provide\npolicymakers with unique, timely, and valuable insights into key countries' preparations and goals\nfor the conference, as well as deliberations within countries on climate change policies and\nnegotiating strategies. A late November report detailed China's efforts to coordinate its position\nwith India and ensure that the two leaders of the developing world are working towards the same\noutcome. Another report provided advance details of the Danish proposal and their efforts to launch\na \"rescue plan\" to save COP-15.\n\n\f(TSIISIHREL) Given such large participation (with all 192 UN member states invited to attend),\nleaders and negotiating teams from around the world will undoubtedly be engaging in intense lastminute policy formulating; at the same time, they will be holding frequent sidebar discussions with\ntheir counterparts -- details of which are of great interest to our policymakers. While the outcome\nof the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference remains uncertain, signals intelligence will\nundoubtedly play a significant role in keeping our negotiators as well informed as possible\nthroughout the 2-week event.\n\n\f",

The objectives defining the scope of this\nresearch activity are:\n1) (S//REL) To assess if it is to NSA’s benefit to continue research into whether\npractical-scale QC can be developed within a reasonable timeframe, to identify its most\npromising physical embodiment(s), and to formulate a credible scenario for its large-scale\ndevelopment;\n2) (U//FOUO) To gain an understanding of the computational cryptanalytic capabilities\nof quantum computers; and\n3) (U//FOUO) To identify practical cryptographic methods that are not susceptible to\nquantum computational attack.\n(S//REL) These guidelines do not cover the possibility of large-scale cryptologic QC\ndevelopment programs at NSA, but only the research and planning preliminary to, and in\npossible support of, such programs.\n(S//SI//REL) Much of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most\neffectively pursued in NSA-funded open research programs. These programs play a critical role\nas the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the field. However, NSA\nis pursuing more than just basic, unclassified research. NSA is also attempting to preserve the\nSIGINT potential of quantum computing (i.e., the cryptanalytic applications of QC) while\nsimultaneously attempting to protect the information security of both the Government and\nprivate sectors against hostile QC attacks (i.e., the cryptographic, mission assurance applications\nof QC of interest to the Information Assurance community). These goals must be pursued at the\nclassified level.\n(U//FOUO) There are several fundamental reasons for classifying QC research:\n\n1) (TS//SI//REL) To protect NSA’s efforts to develop cryptanalytic QC to attack highgrade public key encryption systems by denying adversaries information concerning\nNSA’s assessment of, and/or plans for, large-scale QC development;\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n2) (S//REL) To enable us to track our adversaries’ degree of success or failure in similar\nQC development efforts; and\n3) (U//FOUO) To protect our own systems against adversarial cryptanalytic QC efforts.\n(S//REL) Based on this, the distinctions between unclassified and classified information\ncontained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassified basic-level, academic-scale\nresearch of scientific interest, and more comprehensive classified research which might disclose\ntechniques that may otherwise be possible to protect, or which might imply, rightly or wrongly,\nserious intent on NSA’s part to pursue large-scale development of cryptanalytic quantum\ncomputers.\nDescription of Information\n\nClassification/\nMarkings\n\nCategory\n\nDeclass\n\nRemarks\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n(U) Details may require handling\nas UNCLASSIFIED//FOR\nOFFICIAL USE ONLY or may be\nclassified.\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n(U) Details may require\nclassification and may be\ncompartmented.\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n(U) Details, including specifying\nwhich U.S. organization, may\nrequire handling as\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR\nOFFICIAL USE ONLY or may be\nclassified.\n\nA.

Cryptology\nbreaks out into two disciplines: cryptography (making or using codes/ciphers) and cryptanalysis\n(breaking codes/ciphers).\n(U) Detailed engineering design - Specifications of a set of qubits and the associated\ninitialization, control, and measurement hardware and software at a level of detail commensurate\nwith the requirements of industrial fabrication.\n(U) Fidelity - Precision of qubit operations such as initialization, logic gates, and readout.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n(U) High-fidelity N-qubit Device - An engineered processing device that integrates N coupled,\nhigh-fidelity physical qubits, i.e., qubits with fidelity of operations near or beyond the accuracy\nthreshold for efficient error correction.\n(S//REL) Level A QC - Unclassified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design,\nphysical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory\nfor Physical Sciences/R3.\n(S//REL) Level B QC - Classified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design,\nphysical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory\nfor Physical Sciences/R3. The boundaries are based on the number and quality of qubits, realism\nand specificity of design, control precision, and detail of analysis. While these boundaries may\nchange over time, as of the publication of this guide, the values are:\n(1) (S//REL) Detailed engineering design of 51 or more physical qubits;\n(2) (S//REL) Implementation and operation of a high-fidelity 21-or-more physical-qubit\ndevice; or\n(3) (S//REL) Implementation and operation of three (3) or more logical qubits, with\nsufficient speed and precision to allow preservation of quantum information and logical\ngates between the qubits.\n(U) Logical qubits - Collections of several physical qubits configured in a circuit allowing\ndetection and correction both of errors and of loss of quantum coherence.\n(U) For the purposes of this guide, the circuit configuration of a logical qubit must allow\ndetection and correction of at least all errors affecting any single physical qubit. A logical\nqubit comprising N physical qubits must also be a high-fidelity N-qubit device.\n(U) Physical qubit - A physical entity capable of storing a qubit of information and being\ninitialized, operated on, and measured. Examples include, but are not limited to: photons,\nelectrons, atoms, atomic nuclei, and superconducting Josephson junctions.\n(S//SI//REL) Practical-Scale - Cryptanalytic-scale, with the added requirement that a roadmap\nexists to construct the device with a cost, probability of success, and time-scale of actual\ncryptanalytic importance to NSA. A more specific definition is likely to change over time.\n(U) Quantum coherence - The fundamental quantum-mechanical property of qubits and\ncollections of qubits which may enable some computations to be performed with resources vastly\nsmaller than would be required for classical computers.\n(U) Quantum Computing - Computing with quantum operations on data stored in a collection\nof qubits.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n(U) Quantum gates - Logic operations on one or more qubits that preserve their quantum\ncoherent character.\n(U) Qubit - A “quantum bit,” the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\f",

    "doc_text": "Getting Close to the\nForward-based Defense with QFIRE\nJune 3, 2011\n\nQFIRE Pilot Lead\nNSA/Technology Directorate\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 2007 0 1 0 8\nDeclassify On: 2036 0 4 0 1\n\n\fAbstract\n(TS//SI//REL) The goal of forward-based defense is to detect and mitigate malicious\nthreats in real-time, as close to the source as possible. It is part of a layered defense\nstrategy with four concentric zones: endpoint-, perimeter-, aggregation-, and forwardbased defenses. The QUANTUMTHEORY mission leverages NSA's vast system of\ndistributed passive sensors to detect target traffic and tip a centralized\ncommand/control node. This node assesses the tip and injects a response towards the\ntarget using active TAO assets.\n(TS//SI//REL) Extremely powerful CNE/CND/CNA network effects are enabled by\nintegrating our passive and active systems:\nr e s e ttin g co n n ectio n s\nr e d ire c tin g ta rg e ts fo r e x p lo ita tio n\n* ta k in g c o n tro l o f IRC b o ts\n\" c o rru p tin g file u p lo a d s /d o w n lo a d s\n= More'.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) The success rate of these effects is largely determined by the latency\nfrom tip-to-target. OFIRE is a consolidated QUANTUMTHEORY platform under\ndevelopment that reduces latencies by co-locating (1) existing passive sensors with (2)\nlocal decision resolution, and (3) the ability to locally inject traffic to achieve the\ndesired network effect.\n\n\fTopics\nLayered D efense Model\nNSA TURBULENCE A rc h ite c tu re\n^ TURMOIL passive SIGINT sensors\n^ TURBINE active SIGINT command/control\nQUANTUMTHEORY\n** Integrating passive/active systems for\nCNE/CND/CNA\nQFIRE\n=■Consolidated low-latency QUANTUMTHEORY\ncapability under developm ent fo r forward-based\ndefense\n\n\fForward-based Defense\nNSA TURBULENCE Archit\n\n\fD istributed Sensors: Passive\n(~ ~\n\n\nr - f - i /^ r\n\nAccesses\n&\nI{ £\n\nTURMOIL\nTUTELAGE\n\nU R w rrr\n\n(S//SI//REL) High-speed passive collection\nsystems intercept foreign target satellite, microwave,\nand cable communications as thev transit the alobe.\n\n\fTURBINE: A ctive Mission M a n a g e m e n t\nAccesses\n*\n\nTURMOIL\nTUTELAGE\nImplants (TAO)\n\n.\n(TS//SI//REL) TURBINE provides\n^ ^ c e n tr a liz e d automated command/control\nof a large network of active implants\n\n\fQUANTUMTHEORY\n(TS//SI//REL) E xtre m e ly p o w e rfu l CNE/CND/CNA n e tw o rk\ne ffe cts are enabled by in te g ra tin g o u r passive and a c tiv e system s:\n=■\n\nR e s e ttin g c o n n e c tio n s (QUANTUMSKY)\nR e d ire c tin g ta r g e ts fo r e x p lo ita tio n (QUANTUMINSERT)\n\n=>\n\nT a k in g c o n tro l o f IRC b o ts (Q U AN TU M BO T)\n\n=\n\nC o rru p tin g file u p lo a d s /d o w n lo a d s (QUANTUMCOPPER)\n\n(T5//SI//REL) QUANTUMTHEORY d y n a m ic a lly in je cts packets in to a\nta rg e t's n e tw o rk session to achieve CNE/CND/CNA n e tw o rk effects.\n=• D e tect: TURMOIL passive sensors d e te c t ta rg e t tra ffic & tip TURBINE com m and/control.\n=> D e c id e : TURBINE m ission logic con structs response & forw ards to TAO node.\n1 In je c t: TAO node injects response onto Inte rn e t tow ards target.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) The p ro p a g a tio n d e la y fro m tip -to -ta rg e t d e te rm in e s th e\nsuccess ra te o f th e n e tw o rk e ffe c t.

The\nV A L I D A T O R is a client/server-based system that provides unique backdoor access to\npersonal computers of targets of national interest, including but not limited to terrorist\ntargets. V A L I D A T O R is a small Trojan implant used as a back door against a variety of\ntargeted Windows systems, which can be deployed remotely or via hands on access to\nany Windows box from Windows 98 through Windows Server 2003. The LP is on-line\n24/7 and tasking is 'queued', that is, jobs sit in a queue waiting for the target to 'call\nhome', then the job(s) are sent one at a time to the target for it to process them.\nCommands are Put a file, get a file, Put, then execute a file, get system information,\nchange V A L I D A T O R ID, and Remove itself. VALIDATOR'S are deployed to targeted\nsystems and contact their Listening Post (LP) (each V A L I D A T O R is given a specific\nunique ID, specific IP address to call home to it's LP); SEPI analysts validate the target's\nidentity and location (USSID-18 check), then provide a deployment list to Olympus\noperators to load a more sophisticated Trojan implant (currently OLYMPUS, future\nUNITEDRAKE). An OLYMPUS operator then queue up commands for the specific\nV A L I D A T O R ID's given by SEPI. Process repeats itself. Once target is hooked with the\nmore sophisticated implant, V A L I D A T O R operators tend to cease. On occasion,\noperators are instructed by SEPI or the SWO to have V A I D A T O R delete itself.\n\n\fOLYMPUSFIRE\nOLYMPUSFIRE is an exploitation system that uses a software implant on a\nMicrosoft Windows based target PC to gain complete access to the targeted PC. The\ntarget, when connected to the Internet, will contact a Listening Post (LP) located at an\nNSA/USSS facilities, which is online 24/7, and get its commands automatically.\nThese commands include directory listings, retrieving files, performing netmaps, etc.\nThe results of the commands are then returned to the LP, where the data is collected\nand forwarded to CES and analysis and production elements.\n\nUsmn?

The few that don't involve those niche partners for whom our strategy\nis to simply maintain a viable relationship that we can rely on should we need it in the future. And that\nthese are only some of the accomplishments for FY13...there are way too many to address in just an\nhour.\nWhen it comes to discussing the challenges and roadblocks that we believe are going to make it difficult\nif not impossible to accomplish specific items, the causative factors are divided between NSA and\npartner budget cuts, legal and policy impediments on the partner side, and in a few cases partner\nunwillingness to cooperate or meet their obligations to us.\n\nSelect Accomplishments: Production (second slide)\n(TS//SI//NF) Sweden: This is the DIRNSA-initiated Quantum trilat between NSA, GCHQ, and FRA. While\nthe overall success rate has been low, the effort can be considered a success in terms of proof of\nconcept.

    "doc_text": "TOP \n\nNational Security Agency/Central 18 April 2013\nSecurity Service\n\nInformation Paper\n\n \n\nto USA, FVEY) Subject: NSA Intelligence Relationship with Sweden\n(U) Introduction\n\nTO USA, FVEY) relationship with the Swedish SIGINT service,\nForsvarets Radioanstalt (FRA), was established in 1954 under the UKUSA agreement.\nAt that time it was agreed that GCHQ would take the lead for the exchange of COMINT\ninformation and that NSA would take the lead for the ELINT exchange. As of April\n2004, NSA, GCHQ and the FRA agreed to dissolve this part of the UKUSA agreement\nand hold bilateral exchanges on both COMINT and ELINT.\n\nNSA's relationship with the FRA, an extremely competent, technically\ninnovative, and trusted Third Party partner, continues to grow. The FRA provided NSA\nwith access to its cable collection in 2011, providing unique collection on high-priority\nRussian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy.\n\n. FRA's efforts against counter-terrorism (CT) targets continue to expand, and\nnew legislation enacted in January 2013 has improved its ability to work directly with the\nSwedish internal security service (SAPO).

GCHQ's head of Foreign Relations: and the Director General of Sweden's SIGINT Service allowing NSA\nto deal with the FRA on COMINT issues without pre-coordination with GCHQ. The paper also requires both of us to keep the other informed as to what we are doing with the FRA. and requires the FRA to dedupe If\nboth GCHQ and we are separately asking for the same or similar exchanges.

It also presents an opportunity for NSA/CSS leadership to\nreiterate their commitment to the Swedish partnership.\nVISITOR REQUESTED:\n• (TS//REL USA, SWE) FRA requested a W1NTERL1GHT (Quantum project) update and\nasked to hear about our plans for sharing reports on Quantum tipping or intercepts from\nthe Quantum tipping. FRA plans to start the conference by giving an overview of its\nSIGINT Roadmap, to include Russia,\n.

Last month, we received a message from our Swedish\npartner that G C H Q received FRA Q U A N T U M tips that led to 100 shots, five of which\nwere successfully redirected to the GCHQ server. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)\nconfirmed with Tailored Access Operations (TAO) that this validates the \"proof of\nconcept\" that was originally trying to be accomplished. Additionally, FAD, TAO, and\nEnterprise Information Technology Services are still working through the technical\nsolution to have FRA tip directly to NSA. S3 Data Acquisitions' goal is to have a\nsolution for a direct tip to FRA operational by this summer. The Quantum effort\nmotivated the recent X K E Y S C O R E installation. FRA is currently evaluating it for use to\nsupport their SIGINT Development work.\nCable Access/Reporting and Analysis:\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Highlight that NSA/CSS would like to continue to\ncollaborate on FRA's cable access program, which has resulted in unique SIGINT\nreporting on a variety of high-priority SIGINT topics (123 reports thus far this fiscal\nyear). FRA continues to gain access to more data from additional telecommunications\ncompanies, making the cable access potentially lucrative for NSA/CSS for targets beyond\nRussia.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\nCyber:\n• (TS//REL TO USA, SWE) Stress that NTOC is ready to seriously engage with FRA on\ncyber defense. Mr. Akesson has reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\nand has no changes; therefore, we would like to have an official signing during the\n24 April 1130-1200 discussions.\n•\n\n(TS//SI//NF) N T O C shared some information with FRA about a Swedish intrusion in\nNovember 2012. FRA came in with questions in February 2013 that led N T O C to do\nmore analysis. Subsequently, N T O C reached the same conclusion as FRA, that it\ninvolved the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. FRA asked if it could alert Israel and NTOC\nagreed that it could tell Israel about the intrusion. Israel's identity was never\ncompromised.\n\nSecure VTC Capability\n• (S//REL T O USA, FVEY) Encourage FRA to set up its equipment soonest to allow for\nsecure VTC capability. That capability already exists with Norway and Denmark and has\nshown benefit in expanding analytic collaboration on a myriad of issues. F R A ' s\ntechnology directorate is just waiting on requirements from its SIGINT directorate to be\nable to finalize the set-up and installation.\nCounterterrorism:\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) N S A / C S S ' Counterterrorism (CT) analysts and FRA\ncontinue to cooperate and collaborate on CT threat-related activities in Europe. Several\nanalyst-to-analyst meetings have taken place and European Cryptologic Center (ECC) in\nDarmstadt, Germany, is formally coordinating a Staff Processing Form (SPF) to have\nSweden assist NSA/CSS with high-priority CT Swedish language traffic that ECC is\ncurrently unable to fully analyze. In January 2013, CT established its first CT deployed\nanalyst position in Stockholm. Also in January, FRA and SAPO were legally allowed to\ncollaborate after a 4-year hiatus.\n•\n\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Encourage increased collaboration on CT threat streams.\n\nRussia:\n• (S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Thank Sweden for its continued work on the Russian\ntarget, and underscore the primary role that FRA plays as a leading partner to work the\nRussian target, including Russian leadership, energy,\nand\n, and\ncounterintelligence. F R A ' s cable access has resulted in unique SIGINT reporting on all\nof these areas.\n•\n\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Encourage continued collaboration and sharing of reporting\non Russian topics.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\nVISIT FORMAT:\n• (S//REL TO USA, SWE) GEN Alexander's opening remarks will set the tone for a\nproductive conference.\n• (S//REL T O USA, SWE) FRA will provide briefings on F R A ' s SIGINT Roadmap; its\nnew cyber division; its relationship with the Swedish Internal Security Service, SÄPO;\nand updates on the special project and NAPA-3.\n• (U//FOUO) NSA Participants: SID DIR, DIRFA, Associate D/DIR for CT, GCM, Russia\nProduction Center, GCM, Office of South Asia, GCM, Office of China/Korea, NTOC,\nNCSC, SSO, Special Projects Office (LEGEND).\nPREVIOUS VISITS A N D RESPECTIVE TOPICS:\n• (S//REL TO USA, SWE) Mr. Äkesson last visited NSA/CSS for SWEDUSA in May\n2012.\nPOTENTIAL LANDMINES: (U) None.\nO T H E R INFORMATION: (U) None.\nRECENT PRESS INDICATIONS: (U) None.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\f",

Each section includes a brief description of\nthe analytic, its status, source data, and caveats.\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) While each analytic was designed to operate on a particular type of data or a\nparticular data format, many can likely be scaled to operate on other data sources. For instance,\nanalytics designed for DNR GCID or VLR data might also apply to DNI Geolocation data.\n\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The process of documenting these analytics raised a series of important issues\nthat not only distinguish the analytics from each other, but more importantly, shape the landscape\nthat we must consider in moving forward to meet the analytic needs at NSA. Some of these issues are\ndiscussed in the next section.\n\nIssues and Questions\nShould a co-travel analytic consider where a GCID or VLR is physically located?\no\n\nMany GSM analytics use GCID information to identify co-travelers. If two selectors are seen\nat the same GCID around the same time, they are considered co-travel candidates. The\nanalytic does not need to know where the GCID is physically located. However, if the\nindividuals are using different network providers (e.g., T-Mobile and Verizon), they may be\nphysically standing next to each other as their mobiles register with different cell towers.\nCo-travel analytics that do not consider the physical geo-locations of the towers will not\ndiscover individuals that are co-traveling on different networks.\n\no\n\nAnalytics that make use of point data (e.g., Thuraya) necessarily need to consider\ngeolocational data in order to determine distance from one point to another.\n\nShould incidental co-travelers be considered?\no\n\nThere is a difference between incidental co-travel due to collective movement (individuals\nwith similar travel behaviors but no other similarities) and functional group-based co-travel\namong individuals with behaviorally relevant relationships. CTCOP makes this definition\nexplicit, but warns that we might not want to exclude seemingly incidental co-travelers\nsimply because we are unaware of their relationship.\n\no\n\nOther factors, such as contact chains and target COMSEC behaviors (frequent power-down,\nhandset swapping, SMS behavior), might assist in determining whether co-travelers are\nassociated through their travel behaviors alone or through behaviorally relevant\nrelationships.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nShould geography play a role in co-travel?\no\n\nBecause it is difficult to know where a GSM target is located within a GCID or VLR, many of\nthe GSM co-travel analytics use the mathematical central point in the VLR or GCID as a\nreference point. We could postulate that traveling targets will be located along roads, train\ntracks, or footpaths where network service exists. This type of geographical information\ncould theoretically be used to inform a co-traveler analytic in identifying candidates\n(especially those that are traveling via the same means of transportation). Geographical\ninformation might also be used to \"fill in the gaps\" when data is missing between locations\nthat a target visited.\n\no\n\nAnalytics in this study that make use of such geographical information include DSD's Cotravel analytic and the Geospatial Analysis Tradecraft Center's (GATC's) Opportunity Volume\nanalytic.\n\nShould device and collection sampling play a role in determining co-travelers?\no\n\nWe may collect hundreds of events from one target's mobile phone while collecting only a\nfew events from his co-traveler's mobile phone. The number of events collected may be due\nto collection bias, differences in network service, and/or target COMSEC behavior. Analytics\nshould take these considerations into account when attempting to identify co-travelers.\n\nShould co- travelers seen in different source databases be considered?\no\n\nDepending on a target's preferred communication behaviors, some co-travelers may be\nseen largely in DNR GSM data, and other co-travelers may be seen largely in DNI data. We\nmay be able to construct a more complete picture of a target's locations over time if we\ncombine DNR and DNI data sources. It might be worth considering the degree to which\nconsidering multiple data sources will significantly increase the number of false positives.\n\no\n\nDatabases that do not contain geolocation information might also be considered. For\ninstance, air travelers on the same reservation number are probably co-traveling on the\nsame flight. Users sharing a MAC address are probably co-located using the same device\neven though we may not know where that device is located. Consistent observations of\ndevices within the same LAIC may provide evidence of co-location, even if the LAIC's\nphysical service area is unknown. Finally, similarities between IP addresses may indicate\nproximity on the same LAN, even if the physical location of the LAN nodes is unknown.\n\no\n\nThe one analytic in this study that attempts to combine multiple sources of information to\nbuild a more holistic picture of a target's travel pattern is the TAC/Cafe/TMAC Co-travel\nanalytic.\n\nCan co-travel be considered a series of meetings?\no\n\nWe attempted to limit this study to targets co-traveling through two or more locations\nwithin an analyst-specified time and space window. If those locations are defined, however,\nwe might consider co-travel as a series of \"meetings\" at known locations. Analytics that\ndetect co-location may be different in nature from those that detect co-travel. The specific\nanalytic need will define which of these approaches is more appropriate and efficient.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\no\n\nIn this study, examples of meeting analytics that detect instances of co-location include the\nGATC Opportunity Volume Analytic and the ^ ^ ^ Meet&Greet Spatial Chaining Analytic.\n\nAnalytics\nCHALKFUN\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Chalkfun's Co-Travel analytic computes the date, time, and network location\nof a mobile phone over a given time period, and then looks for other mobile phones that were seen in\nthe same network locations around a one hour time window. When a selector was seen at the same\nlocation (e.g., VLR) during the time window, the algorithm will reduce processing time by choosing a few\nevents to match over the time period. Chalkfun is SPCMA enabled1.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Note: As of 6 September 2012, the events that are chosen depend on the\n\"sampling method\" chosen by the analyst (most active, most per day, first/last/most, or\nfirst/last/spread). The \"sampling rate\" specifies how many events are chosen to match. As Chalkfun\nmoves to the cloud, this option will be discontinued.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The cloud-based version of Chalkfun (see R6 SORTINGLEAD Co-traveler\nAnalytic section), which may be released as early as September 2012, will have a number of additional\nfeatures and options:\n•\n\nThe system will run one query (rather than separate queries) for all of the IMSIs, MSISDNs, VLRs,\nand GCIDs that an analyst enters (as if the selectors and areas of interest were joined with an\n\"OR\"). The system currently runs separate queries for each, returning separate sets of results for\neach combination of selector and areas of interest. The cloud-based version will also enable the\nuser to set the size of the time window that the analytic considers, rather than defaulting to one\nhour (as described above).\n\n•\n\nThe user will be able to choose the countries or locations of interest. Blacklist and whitelist\nfeatures will enable the user to instruct the system to ignore activity within a region, or restrict\nanalysis to specified regions of interest (e.g., ignore activity in\n\n•\n\nor use only activity from\n\nIn considering potential co-travelers, the analyst will have the option to ignore activity in which\nthe target is in his home country\n\n\n(S//SI//REL) SPCMA enables the analytic to chain \"from,\" \"through,\" or \"to\" communications metadata fields\nwithout regard to the nationality or location of the communicants, and users may view those same\ncommunications metadata fields in an unmasked form.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n•\n\nThe analyst will be able to filter in or out potential co-travelers with specified prefixes (for\ninstance, return only\n\nmobiles, remove all\n\nmobiles, them, or include only mobiles\n\nthat are from the same country as the target).\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n- Operational; Available at\nanalysts desktops\n- Cloud version could be\navailable as early as September\n2012.\n\nSource Data\n- All FASCIA data containing VLR\nand GCID information\n\nCaveats\n- Current version is not cloudbased and can have long\nprocessing times, however\ncloud-based solution is\nimminent.\n- Analytic will only return cotravelers on the same provider\nnetwork\n\nDSD Co-Travel Analytic\nBackground\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DSD Co-Travel analytic predicts target locations and co-travelers by\ncalculating time-based travel trajectories. Probable travel routes are calculated using observed locations\nand determining the most likely paths and travel times similar to that used in turn-by-turn navigation\nsystems. These target travel paths are represented as a series of LAT/LONG waypoints or line segments\nalong the probable travel routes, such as roads. The travel paths are divided into segments (e.g. 20 to\n50km along the road). The analytic predicts the approximate time that the target would theoretically\narrive at each segment waypoint based on projected travel times between known locations. Then,\nwithin the travel window, the analytic discovers candidate co-travellers that intersect locations along\nthe buffered travel path. The next step in the analytic is performed using interactive Renoir analysis of a\ntwo mode graph representing the route segments and selectors observed on these route segments\nwithin the time windows. Once the data is clean and candidate co-travellers are identified detailed\nanalysis can be done in Renoir or other tools such as GeoTime incorporating other supporting data such\nas communications events and content.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic currently runs on a Netezza-based architecture, called Hectic\nSnare, that rapidly executes MySQL-based QFDs. This architecture enables interactive exploratory\nanalysis and rapid pattern matching. The analytic is distributable and could be implemented in\nHadoop/MapReduce or Accumulo.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic was tested using an\n\nterrorist case study. The case\n\nstudy used approximately 80,000 base stations locations and 16 billion mobiles location records for\nCDRs (Call detail records) and infrastructure collect from DRT and Juggernaut systems. This case study\nshowed that more candidate co-travellers were discovered by analyzing the travel paths than by\nconsidering common meeting locations alone.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nSource Data\n- Mobile CDRs and residing in\nNetezza-based architecture.\n\nAnalytic implemented and\ntested at DSD.\n\nCaveats\n- Requires Netezza (current\nimplementation)\n- Requires Renoir\n\nFuture Work\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) DSD would like to integrate key meeting locations into this analytic, such as\nsafehouses. Plans are also underway to identify targets based on COMSEC behaviors such as identifying\nmobiles that are turned off right before convergence between two travel paths occurs.\n\nGeospatial Analysis Tradecraft Center (GATC) Opportunity Volume\nAnalytic\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The opportunity volume analytic determines whether two entities (e.g.\ndevices) could have been co-located by considering the possibility of their travel paths intersecting. The\nopportunity volume analytic requires pairs of event locations and times for each entity, and computes\nthe possible locations and times in which the two entities could have been co-located. It does this by\ncomputing possible travel route surfaces for each entity between the specified events, using a travel\ncost surface computed from terrain, land cover, and road network data. These possible travel route\nsurfaces include the temporal dimension (that is, the period of time in which the entity could have been\nat the given location); the intersection between these multidimensional surfaces represents the places\nand times during which the entities could have been co-located. The analytic was developed using GPS\npoint event data, but the analytic actually uses a 1-km grid for the spatial resolution and a 15-minute\nperiod for the temporal resolution, so it can be applied to any data that can be expressed in these\nterms.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nPrototype service implemented\non NGANet. Not yet ported to\nNSANet.\n\nSource Data\n- Geohashes of GPS point event\ndata.\n\nCaveats\n- Requires event locations and\ntimes for every selector.\n- Designed for 1 km grid-based\nlocations and 15 minute time\nintervals.\n- Co-travel capability would\nrequire analyst to define a series\nof meetings at specified\nlocations.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The purpose of this service is to determine whether two entities could have\nbeen co-located given observed event locations for those entities. To detect co-travel, the analyst would\nneed to define a series of meeting locations and times. The opportunity volume analytic could also\nprovide a mechanism for vetting co-travel analytics by testing for possible co-location events along cotravel routes.\n\nTMI Co-Traveler Analytic\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The\n\nTrack Mutual Information (TMI) cloud analytic\n\nwas developed as a study under their graph analytics, alerting, and target development program. The\nanalytic is oriented to work on 7 to 30 days worth of regional collection. It has been tested on RT-RG\ndata from the ^ ^ ^\n\nregion. Instead of using GCID information as co-travel reference points, the\n\nanalytic works cross-network by computing target \"closeness\" based on the GCID Lat/Long GEO\ninformation and time. The Lat/Long information is obtained from RT-RG.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic starts by computing event sequences of LAT, LONG, and time for\neach selector. These are called \"tracks\". It then computes a value that measures how far the selector\nhas traveled in general. If the selector has not traveled outside a 20 to 50 km radius, the selector is not\nconsidered. Each eligible selector's tracks are pairwise-compared to the others and a measure of\nsimilarity in time and space is computed.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nInitial development completed.\nIn testing phase, not yet\noperational\n\nSource Data\n- Sortinglead summaries of\nFASCIA data on GM-PLACE and\n- RT-RG regional GSM collection\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic only considers tasked\nselectors as seeds.\n- Analytic does not consider\ntargets that do not travel outside\na 20 to 50 km radius.\n- Track dataset must be\nrepopulated for each data\nupdate\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) | would like to reduce processing by creating an index containing selectors\nwhose tracks are near each other in space. To achieve this, future work may make use of a GEOAddress\nhashing algorithm that uses LAT/LONG information to group cell towers into clusters that are in the\nsame region. This hash considers latitude and longitude only, and is agnostic to the targets' service\nprovider. It may be possible to also compare target tracks quickly by comparing these GeoAddresses.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nCo-Traveler Analytics\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY)\nhas developed two co-travel analytics: Fast Follower (FF) and\nMeet&Greet Spatial Chaining (MGSC). The FF analytic was initially designed to detect individuals who\nare following station personnel. Detailed non-SIGINT path data is collected consensually on the station\npersonnel, and this reference path data provides the seeds for this analytic, which attempts to discover\nmobile GEO data indicating individuals that may be following the station personnel. The MGSC analytic\nis designed to detect meetings between high-value individuals and other entities.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The FF analytic begins by considering non-SIGINT reference paths for station\npersonnel based on detailed knowledge of the entity's location. Candidate followers are determined by\nidentifying other individuals that have traversed some number of consecutive points (determined by the\nanalyst) that match the reference path in space and time. The analyst also sets a parameter to specify\nthe minimum distance that must be covered along a candidate path.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The MGSC analytic is designed for ELKPRINTS data from smartphones. This\nanalytic identifies sequences of consecutive location points close in time and combines them into a\nsingle data point. A maximum velocity movement parameter is applied to create a time window around\neach point representing the approximate time at which the individual was located there (as opposed to\ntraveling to or from that location). Finally, co-travelers are identified by discovering pairs of selectors\nthat meet the duration and distance thresholds set by the analyst as input parameters. Spatial chaining\nsoftware aggregates and presents the meeting data, including the locations, times, and scoring metrics\nto the analyst.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nThe MGSC analytics has been\ntested on real ELKPRINTS data,\nbut results have not been\nvalidated by operational\nanalysts.\nThe FF analytic has been tested\non made-up data.\n\nSource Data\n- Smartphone data from\nELKPRINTS\n- Reference-path data (FF)\n- List of selectors (MGSC)\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic designed for precise\ngeolocation data (e.g., from\nsmartphones)\n- MGSC analytic would require\nthe analyst to define a series of\nmeetings\n\nPACT NGA-NSA GATC Analytic\n\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The PACT analytic is a joint NSA-NGA effort to identify co-traveling Thuraya\nhandsets. The effort was motivated by an increase in Thuraya phone usage by\nSIGINT Geospatial Analysts were able to characterize the travel\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nbehaviors of the targeted Thuraya handsets and identifying other handsets with similar patterns. The\ntargeted handsets were observed traveling between known ^ ^ ^ government and military\ninstallations; therefore, handsets with similar travel behaviors were inferred to be ^ ^ ^ government\nforces.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The first step of PACT is to identify a set of waypoints for each target handset.\nWaypoints are generated from sequences of events that cluster together in space and time. The second\nstep is to identify which pairs of handsets contain similar waypoint clusters. Pairs are scored based on\nthe number of waypoint clusters that match. This analytic also considers the total possible number of\nwaypoint clusters for each selector, so that the total number of communication events per selector is\ntaken into consideration. This process is intended to reduce the possibility of producing results that\ninclude incidental co-travel. The third step in this analytic identifies persistent patterns by examining the\ntime periods over which co-location occurs for each co-travel candidate pair.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nTested on VOICESAIL data from\nCULTWEAVE. Patterns stored in\nQFD.\nIn process of transitioning PACT\nto NSA/S2.\n\nSource Data\n- Thuraya data from CULTWEAVE\n(~500 M waypoints in\nCULTWEAVE)\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic designed for Thuraya\nor other point data\n\nFuture Work\nFuture work could involve applying this analytic to other types of QFD datasets such as Inmarsat and\nGSM data. The team is also interested in building on this analytic to enable discovery of asynchronous\nco-traveling relationships.\n\nR6 SORTINGLEAD Co-Traveler Analytic\nBackground\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) R6 has been partnering with Chalkfun to upgrade the Chalkfun co-traveler\nanalytic to a cloud-based analytic that will run on Cloud 14 (to eventually be migrated to MDR-2).\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The R6 co-traveler analytic accepts a selector and timeframe as input, and\nthen derives an itinerary for the selector that includes the CELL IDs and/or VLRs (depending on what is\navailable). The itinerary is based on a series of waypoints generated from the location information that\nis available in FASCIA-PCS. Then, the analytic searches for other selectors that were \"near\" these\nwaypoints in space and time. Time windows are configurable and can be adjusted by the user. Each\ncandidate is scored and then prioritized based on the scores.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The R6 co-traveler analytic operates on Sortinglead Event Summaries and a\nGEO Index. The Sortinglead Event Summaries provide rapid access to FASCIA PCS events by summarizing\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nand enriching key elements of selector behavior. The Sortinglead Event Summaries benefit this analytic\nbecause they can provide enriched location information about selectors that is not present in the raw\nmetadata. The GEO Index contains a mapping between the locations (GCIDs or VLRs) visited by a\nselector and the time (day/minute) that the visit(s) occurred. Information from command and control\nnetworks that track IED attacks is also used to enrich the GEO Index.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The results that can be returned from this type of analytic can potentially be\nenormous. Each candidate will have some level of time and space overlap with the seed. Prioritization\noccurs by assessing the quality of the overlap in terms of time and space closeness. The analyst may\nchoose to triage any number of potential candidates (e.g. top 10 or top 100 candidates, or candidates\nthat surpass a given threshold).\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\n- In testing phase to be\nreplacement back-end for the\ncurrent production CHALKFUN\nco-traveler tool\n- Cloud-based (MapReduce)\nimplementation under\ndevelopment to handle larger\nnumbers of queries\nsimultaneously\n\nSource Data\n- FASCIA PCS Sortinglead\nSummaries\n- CHALKFUN enrichment (VLR\ncountry mapping)\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic cannot recover crossnetwork co-travelers\n- Analytic will not be effective\nagainst stationary (non-traveling)\ntargets\n- Processing is memory intensive\n- Analytic is sensitive to large\ncells, VLRs, and dense areas\n- Not directly applicable to sat\nphones with LAT/LONG\ninformation\n- Results can be very sensitive to\ntimeframe chosen as input. For\ninstance, analytic will not be\neffective for large queries across\nmultiple countries and large time\nframes (e.g., anywhere in\nover the past year and then\nanywhere in\n).\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Because the R6 co-traveler analytic depends on GCID and VLR locations as\nmeeting points or waypoints, it will not return selectors that co-travel on different provider networks.\n(For instance, it could not return a Verizon selector co-traveling with a T-Mobile selector.) The R6 team\nis working on experiments that might \"alias\" seed selectors to nearby selectors on other networks to get\naround this problem, but this poses challenges. The RT-RG analytic (discussed later in this paper) uses\nrelative velocities to deal with the cross-network challenge, but this approach requires pre-computing\ntravel behavior for all pairs of selectors, which can be computationally expensive.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nRT-RG Sidekicks\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The RT-RG Sidekick Cloud-Based Co-traveler analytic compares average travel\nvelocity between pairs of selectors to infer whether or not could co-travel would practically be possible.\nThe velocity factor is intended to reduce the number of false positives when considering travel among\nurban areas by filtering out pairs of selectors that were seen at the same series of CELL IDs or VLRs over\ntime, but could not have been traveling together because the location data timestamps presuppose an\nunreasonable velocity. This may happen because one or both of the selectors in the pair may have been\nlocated at the edges of the network coverage during one or more of their travel midpoints.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic first computes \"movement summaries\" of all available tasked\nselectors. The movement summaries contain a list of locations that a target visited during the timeframe\nof interest, given by the analyst. Locations are defined by CELL IDs (for GSM) or GEO-Hashes (for ^ ^ ^ ^\nany other selectors with Lat/Long). Then, the system discovers pairs of targets that could be traveling\ntogether by comparing their sequences of physical locations and factoring out pairs that could not have\nreasonably arrived at the meeting waypoints within 10 minutes of each other.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) One of the main benefits of the RT-RG Sidekicks analytic is that it is not\nconstrained by provider network. Because it considers physical (LAT/LONG) locations and travel\nvelocities, it can provide co-traveler results that include selectors on different provider networks.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\n- QFD available at RT-RG analyst\ndesktop.\nRT-RG Tools: Goldminer, CHET,\nGEOT\n\nSource Data\n- Sortinglead Event Summaries\n(the\nsubset\nof Fascia PCS)\n- Currently running on RT-RG\n- Could possibly scale to FASCIA\nevent summaries\n\nCaveats\n- Requires accurate tower geo\ndata (location and date)\n- Requires pre-computing all\nselectors against all selectors,\nwhich can be expensive\n- Current output includes only\ntasked selectors\n- Analytic is not designed for\nstationary targets.\n\nFuture Work\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Currently, the system is integrated with RT-RG, operating on ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nGSM data. It may scale to a larger data source; however, it is designed to precompute sidekicks for each\npossible pair or tasked selectors.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic could also be applied to DNI location data.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nScalable Analytics Tradecraft Center (SATC) Geospatial Lifelines CoTravel QFD\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines QFD applies the concept of \"dwell times\" to identify\nDNR co-travelers. Dwell times describe the time period spent at the beginning or ending destination. A\nlocation is considered a beginning or ending location if the dwell time at that location is greater than 2\nhours.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This QFD first generates geohashes using GSM event data, and then\ncalculates transition lines indicating that a device traveled from one geohash to another. The result is a\ngraph in which the geohashes represent nodes and the transitions represent links or edges. Clustering\nalgorithms are applied to the graphs to determine locations and selectors of interest.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines represent the beginning and ending locations, as\ndefined by their dwell times, and all other intermediate observations. The likeliness of co-travel along\npaths between starting and destination points is based on the following measurements: net distance,\ntime of transition (mins), speed (kph), Azimuth, and number of travel segments.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nSource Data\n- Geohashes of GSM event data\nretrieved from FASCIA.\n\nAnalytic tested on 90 days of\nGSM event data from\nCode is available through SATC,\nbut analytic is no longer under\ndevelopment.\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic designed for GSM\ndata, but could be applied to\nother types of data\n- Oriented to targets that remain\nin one location for at least 2\nhours\n- Requires Geocoded source data\nfor generating Geohashes\n\nFuture Work\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The code for this QFD is available through SATC, but the analytic is no longer\nunder development. Ideas for future work before the project ended included adding acceleration and\nsinuosity to the computation.\n\nSSG Common IMSIs Analytic\nBackground\n(S//SI//REL) The Common IMSIs Analytic is a model in SEDB JEMA finds SIM card activity seen on cell\ntower panels in multiple areas (e.g.- border crossings commonly used by traffickers). It makes use of the\nTower QFD.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n(S//SI//REL) Analyst inputs areas of interest and time range. The analytic returns an excel file with a list\nof IMSIs seen in those areas at that time. It is enriched with OCTAVE tasking information. Limitations are\nthat tower locations in OCTSKYWARD can be imprecise. Also, the SEDB Tower QFD summarizes IMSIs by\nLAIC by day. Summaries by MSISDN or IMEI are not available.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nAvailable in JEMA.\n\nSource Data\n-OCTAVE and FASCIA\n\nCaveats\n- Cell tower locations in\nOCTSKYWARD can be imprecise.\n- The SEDB Tower QFD\nsummarizes IMSIs by LAIC by\nday.\n- Summaries by MSISDN or IMEI\nare not available.\n\nAdditional Information\nhttps://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/wiki/Analytics Taxonomy\nhttps://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/wiki/DNR Travel Pattern\n\nTarget Analysis Center (TAC)/Café/ Travel and Mobility Analysis Center\n(TMAC) DNI Co-Travel Analytic\nCafé Spin 1 (October 2011 - January 2012)\n\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The Café project involved TMAC, SSG, T1212, and S2I5 working in concert to\ndevelop both DNI and DNR cloud-based travel analytics. The absence of a cloud-based solution that\ncould run over bulk data motivated this initiative. The Café objective was to steer cloud travel analytics\ntoward operational use and ultimately merge the DNI and DNR analytics in a unified co-travel analytic.\nThese analytics are currently still under development; however, they are available to the development\ncommunity on GM-PLACE.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic uses IP geolocation of active user/presence events as travel\nindication.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DNI analytic operates in one of two modes. The first mode accepts a list\nof tasked targets via UTT, and attempts to identify co-travelers for those targets that have been deemed\nto have travelled during a specified time window (typically 30 days). The analytic only considers targets\nthat traveled between at least 2 countries in a given month. For these traveling targets, candidate cotravelers are scored based on how many times they were seen in the same locations during the same\ntimes as the target. Target locations are given by DNI selector IP geolocation, provided by ASDF enriched\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\nwith GEO reference data (or geo-tagging where available). Because this data provides city-level location\nresolution, co-traveler candidates are assigned scores based on the extent to which they were seen in\nthe same cities and on the same days as targets.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The second mode accepts a pattern representing target travel across\nspanning countries of interest (e.g.,\n\nand optionally, the days on which the countries\n\nwere visited. In this mode, the TAC/Cafe/TMAC DNI Co-travel analytic in this mode identifies travelers\nthat (at minimum) match the pattern. All candidates that match the pattern are regarded as possible\nco-travelers.\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The result of these analytics is a QFD monthly roll-up that can be queried.\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nSource Data\n- Tasked DNI selectors (UTT)\n- Geotagged ASDF data\n- User-provided travel patterns\n\nAvailable to developers with\naccess to Ghostmachine (GMPLACE)\n\nCaveats\n- Tasked targets or travel\npatterns provided as input;\nresults include tasked and\nuntasked targets\n- Analytic operates at the\ncountry level to determine\ntravel/city level for co-traveler\ndetermination, and designed to\nprovide monthly QFD roll-up\n- Proxies and other shared IP\nsettings can render IP\ngeolocation susceptible\n\nFuture Work\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The TAC/Cafe/TMAC DNI Co-traveler team also considered capabilities to\nenable follow-on queries utilizing CHALKFUN for convergence efforts to identify roaming handsets as\npossible DNI target co-travelers.\n\nOther resources\nhttps://ncmd-satc01.ncmd.nsa.ic.gov/gambit/public/q7dni travel analytic cloud version\nhttps://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/wiki/Cafetravel dni co-travelers\n\nTAC/Café/TMAC DNR Co-Traveler Analytic\nCafé Spin 2 (January - July 2012)\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nBackground\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The Café project involved TMAC, SSG, T1212, and S2I5 working in concert to\ndevelop both DNI and DNR cloud-based travel analytics. The absence of a cloud-based solution that\ncould run over bulk data motivated this initiative. The Café objective was to merge the DNI and DNR\nanalytics to create one complete co-travel analytic; however the DNR co-traveler analytic, described\nbelow, is currently still under development.\n(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DNR cloud-based analytic considers all known targets (tasked in OCTAVE)\nthat have traveled within a given date range (e.g., monthly roll-up to five month range), and attempts to\nfind their co-travelers. Co-travelers are defined as individuals that were seen in the same area (currently\ndefined by VLRs) around the same time as the targets. The output includes both tasked and untasked\nselectors as possible co-travelers with the tasked seeds. Each possible co-traveler is assigned a score\nthat indicates the probability of co-travel with the seed. Higher scores are assigned to co-travelers that\nare seen at more of the same locations and closer in time (pairs are given one point if seen within one\nhour, and a half point if seen within two hours of each other).\n\nStatus and Summary\nStatus\n\nAnalytic has been tested on\nFASCIA data on GM-PLACE\nCommand line interface\navailable to developers\n\nSource Data\n- FASCIA data on GM-PLACE\n- ~40B rows in the GM PLACE\nCLOUDBASE table\n- CHALKFUN Enrichment (VLR\nCountry mapping)\n- CLOUDBASE Events (IMSI,IMEI)\nrounded to nearest hour\n\nCaveats\n- Analytic only considers tasked\nselectors as seeds\n- Source data provided by VLRs\n- Co-travel events are rolled-up\nby the hour\n\nFuture Work\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Follow-on analysis could take advantage of FASTSCOPE reservation number\nfeature which will return all co-travelers that travel on the same reservation number within a given time\nperiod (because reservation numbers are reused, a specific timeframe must be provided).\n\nOther Resources\nhttps://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/wiki/DNR Traveler\nhttps://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/wiki/DNR Co-Traveler\nhttps://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/wiki/DNR Travel Pattern\n\nDNR Co-Traveler Manual Analysis\nTaken from: https://ncmdsatc01.ncmd.nsa.ic.gov/gambit/public/q/dnr co travel based on similiar cell ids over a time frame\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n1.

Many of the analytics define themselves by (1) the key issues they address in novel ways and\n(2) the types of source data on which they operate.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The key issues section highlights capabilities that might improve the accuracy\nof the analytic results. For example, analytics that have knowledge about the locations of GCIDs and\nVLRs and can augment their procedures with non-SIGINT data such as geographic and terrestrial data.\nThis information contains knowledge about the locations of highways and roads. Analytics that can\ngeographically validate routes between meeting points can then use this information to constrain the\npossible co-travel routes and candidate co-travel selectors along those routes.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Analytics that can operate on a variety of different source data formats,\nincluding both DNI and DNR, benefit from the ability to exploit divergent data sources to develop more\ncomplete pictures of target travel behavior.\n(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The co-travel analytics in this study are at various stages of development,\ntesting, and deployment. One possible way forward could be to have an independent organization2\nperform a formal evaluation of these analytics using a common test dataset. This would enable a fair\ncomparison and assessment of the analytics' processing time, efficiency, and accuracy. Understanding\nthe advantages and challenges of each analytic against a common test dataset with ground truth may\nfacilitate planning for future work.\n\n\nAn independent organization is one that is not involved in the development of any of these analytics and that\ndoes not have a stake in the outcome.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\nAcknowledgments\n(U//FOUO) Thanks to all of the participants in this study, listed as POCs under the individual analytics.\nThese individuals participated in face-to-face meetings and phone interviews, and provided the details\nof their analytics to this study through briefings and write-ups.

So be familiar with the procedures that govern that and\nprevent that from happening.\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Highlights of Targeting and\nMinimization Procedures\n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Now, the good news for you all is that\nI'm not going to sit down in front of you all and read a set of\nminimization procedures to you.

They move into and out of the United States. The\nreason we have this continuing obligation - this is why we have\npost- targeting analysis done by a lot of NSA people who look at\nthings like HLR and VLR registrations of phones. If, all of the\nsudden, a phone that you're targeting registers in a cell inside the\nUnited States, you no longer have a reasonable belief your target is\noutside of the United States. So there are a lot of things like that\ndone - IP [Internet Protocol] look-ups done for collection of email\naddresses.... that sort of thing. These tools are all there to help you\n- these organizations are there to help you - but in the end, the\nresponsibility remains with the analyst.

The SIGINT Enterprise needs to begin taking action now\nto plan for collection, processing, presentation, and analysis of these communications. With a\nfew exceptions, NSA can't even recognize the traffic, and therefore it is impossible to even say\nwhat percentage of the environment is GVE; let alone determine how targets are using the\ncommunications features of GVEs. However, GVEs offer a SIGINT/HUMINT opportunity space\nand more research is needed to figure out effective exploitation.\n(S//SI) GVEs today allow individuals to gather with like-minded others online. Many GVEs\noffer communications such as private chat (P2P), group chat, chat to an alias, and broadcast chat\n-both text and voice. Also many GVEs allow convergent technologies to intermingle such as\nXboxLive! which can be run via an Xbox360 gaming console and/or connect via a PC to normal\nMSN chat. Second Life offers the ability to anonymously text to a GSM phone (SMS) and soon\nthey will offer anonymous voice calls so that phone numbers do not have to be known by either\nparty and won't show up in collection. Some GVEs allow third party interfaces which allow\nlimited functionality from a web browser. This overcomes obstacles such as a high-bandwidth\nrequirement and or not being allowed to download software (think Internet café usage). In\naddition, many GVEs are able to be used via mobile devices connected wirelessly (phones,\nhandhelds, laptops). Connected to the GVEs, specialized forums and other social networking\nsites have sprung up to provide an additional place to interact, connect, or share. These sites and\nany others can be advertised in the GVEs, so that if a terrorist web forum has to move locations it\ncan be found by its members again. Areas/groups can be access-restricted, member-only. They\nare essentially private meeting places, and can be used for planning, comms, and training, etc.\nGVEs are used for collaboration; Forterra's 3D world is coming to JWICS to do this IC-wide.\n(U//FOUO) GVEs have been made that reinforce prejudices and cultural stereotypes while\nimparting a targeted message or lesson both from the Western point of view and in the Middle\nEast. America's Army is a U.S. Army produced game that is free download from its recruitment\npage and is acknowledged to be so good at this the army no longer needs to use it for\nrecruitment, they use it for training. The Lebanese Hizballah has taken this concept and the same\nbasic game design and made its own version of the game called Special Forces 2 (SF2), which its\npress section acknowledges is used for recruitment and training in order to prepare their youth to\n\"fight the enemy\", a radicalizing medium; the ultimate goal is to become a suicide martyr. One\ncannot discount the \"fun factor\" involved—it is important to hold your target audience's\nattention-- and makes ingesting the message not even noticeable. SF2 features multi-player, online text and voice chat for up to 60 players simultaneously, effectively acting like a VPN or\nprivate chat forum. SF2 is offered at $10 a copy and so also goes to fund terrorist operations.\n(S//SI) These games offer realistic weapons training (what weapon to use against what target,\nwhat ranges can be achieved, even aiming and firing), military operations and tactics,\nphotorealistic land navigation and terrain familiarization, and leadership skills. While complete\nmilitary training is best achieved in person, perfection is not always required to accomplish the\nmission. Some of the 9-11 pilots had never flown a real plane, they had only trained using\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20320108\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL//20320108\nMicrosoft's Flight Simulator. When the mission is expensive, risky, or dangerous, it is often a\nwiser idea to exercise virtually, rather than really blow an operative up assembling a bomb or\nexposing a sleeper agent to law enforcement scrutiny. Militaries around the world use virtual\nsimulators with great success and the Hizballah has even hooked up a Playstation controller to a\nlaptop in order to guide some of its real missiles. Kuma Wars is a U.S. owned company that\noffers realistic battle simulation of real battles in Iraq usually one month after they actually\nhappened. The player can re-do maneuvers in a lessons learned way for training, or you can\nswitch sides and see how it works from the opposite side. It also provides real terrain features,\nsuch as real road signs from real roads in Iraq, and a simulated night-vision goggles\nenvironment.\n(TS//SI) Al Qaida terrorist target selectors and GVE executables have been found associated\nwith XboxLive, Second Life, World of Warcraft, and other GVEs in PINWALE network traffic,\nTAO databases, and in forensic data. Other targets include Chinese hackers, an Iranian nuclear\nscientist, Hizballah, and Hamas members. GCHQ has a vigorous effort to exploit GVEs and has\nproduced exploitation modules in XboxLive! and World of Warcraft. After beta testing, they\nexpect reporting to begin in April 2008. The FBI, CIA and the Defense Humint Service all have\nHUMINT operations in Second Life and other GVEs and are very interested in forming a\ndeconfliction and tipping group that would be able to collaborate on operations.\n(TS//SI) GVEs are an opportunity! We can use games for: CNE exploits, social network\nanalysis, HUMINT targeting, ID tracking (photos, doc IDs), shaping activities, geo-location of\ntarget, and collection of comms. It has been well documented that terrorists are OPSEC and tech\nsaavy and are only getting more so over time. These applications and their servers however, are\ntrusted by their users and makes an connection to another computer on the Internet, which can\nthen be exploited. Through target buddylists and interaction found in the gaming and on gaming\nweb sites, social networks can be diagramed and previously unknown SIGINT leads and\nconnections and terrorists cells discovered. GVEs can contain on-line presence indicators,\ngeolocation, and ID tracking can be gleaned and used in apprehension operations.\n(TS//SI) Recommendation: The amount of GVEs in the world is growing but the specific ones\nthat CT needs to be methodically discovered and validated. Only then can we find evidence that\nGVEs are being used for operational uses. Protocol Exploitation, SFL, and TAO should begin\nprofiling their databases and the GVEs for collection and exploitation possibilities. Open source\n(APSTARS) produced GVE lists and selectors should be used to run against UTT and other\ndatabases to check for cross matches to develop target selectors. CT SIGDEV along with CT\nTOPIs will study the collected traffic to find and track targets of interest. There should be a\nconcentrated effort to conduct research into target use of GVEs, and signatures for survey\ncollection should be developed. Targets and specific apps should be chosen to exploit to ensure\nthat terrorists' GVE/social site usage is covered by SIGINT and the system is not left behind the\ntimes. All avenues should be taken to develop PES and CNE exploits as GVEs are found on\ntarget computers. We need to develop a viewer/db that allows linguist/analysts to\nview/experience voice/text/video traffic together and archivee the GVE data associated with\nreporting. which will also be essential for Yahoo, Skype, webcam, VTCs and Biometrics.\n(S//SI) CT SIGDEV/SSG should establish a process to deconflict IC-wide ops in GVEs and to\ndevelop strategy for collaboration. Members from at least CIA, FBI, DIA, NSA and GCHQ\nshould participate to make the coordination significant. Members should have ability to check\ntasking, traffic, and status of current operations.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL//20320108\n\n\f\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nTable of Contents\nFORWARD\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - EXPLOITATION AND FUNCITON OF GAMES: AN\nINTERACTIVE INFLUENCE MEDIUM\n\n\nGaming Markets: Why We Care\nDemographics\nPopularity\n\n\nFunctionality of Online Games\nPropaganda and Influence\nCommunications\nRecruitment\nTraining and Simulation\nFundraising\n\n\nEase of Production of Games\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - WHY GAMES ARE AN EFFECTIVE INFLUENCE PLATFORM ....15\n\nChapter Introduction\n\n\nActive Learning\n\n\nKnowledge and Skills\nApplied Teaching Tool\n\n\nPassive Messaging and Conditioning\nValue Systems\nEmotions\n\n\nThe \"Return for More\" Factor\nEngagement\nAddiction\n\n\nChapter Addendum\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PLAUSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR THE USE OF GAMES IN\nTERRORIST ACTIVITIES\n\n\nChapter Introduction\n\n\nPossible Terrorist Use of Different Game Genres\nFirst-person Shooter Games\nMMORPGs and Virtual Worlds\nMixed or Alternate Reality Games\nSimulation Games\nKnowledge-Based Games\nStrategy Games\n\nChapter Addendum\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 2\n\n29\n32\n36\n38\n40\n\n41\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 4 - EMERGING TRENDS NI THE GAMING SPACE\n\n42\n\nEmerging Trends\n\n45\n\nBroadband Diffusion\nThird Generation (3G) and Beyond\nThe Maturation of the Mobile Platform\nThe Rise of Virtual Worlds\nThe Explosion of User Generated Content\nAdvances in Digital Rendering\nAdvances in the Science of Haptics\n\n45\n47\n49\n51\n54\n56\n57\n\nChapter Addendum\n\n59\n\nCHAPTER 5 - WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS VIRTUALLY\n\n60\n\nFocus Areas\n\n61\n\nCountering In-Game Propaganda\nCompeting for Players with New Games\nCollecting In-Game Intelligence\n\nChapter Addendum\n\n62\n63\n64\n\n65\n\nINDEX\n\n67\n\nREFERENCES\n\n71\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 3\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFORWARD\nVideo games are a media platform that has become part of daily activity for many\naround the world. Whether it is casual gaming on a cell phone or PC, or a virtual world\nwhere individuals are connected via the Internet, interaction in and around games is\nincreasing. Games entertain, encourage interaction, enable financial gain, and teach\nlessons. While many of these activities are meant to be harmless, they also have the\npotential to be exploited for malicious activities.\nOver the course of a year, extensive study was done on the common use of games and\ntheir applicability to terrorist activities. Academic journals and papers, newspaper and\nmagazine articles, textbooks, non-fiction works, in-game exploration and personal\ninterviews on games, psychology and sociology, as well as attendance at seminars on\nthese issues (for example the Serious Games conference or SAIC's Cyber-Influence\nConference series) represent the main sources for this report.\nThe report was written in five stand-alone papers that are compiled here as a\ncomprehensive primer for the current and potential future of game usage. A majority of\nthe information contained in this report identifies facts and trends and applies them to the\nrealm of IC concern (Chapters 1, 2, and 4).

However, the\naverage age of the typical \"gamer\" increases by one year each year and women\nnow comprise nearly one-third of all adult gamers.1\n\n•\n\nThe online gaming population is expected to grow rapidly in the near term,\nresulting in an estimated 10 million online game players in the U.S. (i.e. the\nequivalent of the entire population of New York City) and 30 million online game\nplayers worldwide (i.e. the equivalent of the entire population of Shanghai,\nBombay and Karachi combined).ii\n\n•\n\nWhile the majority of online gamers originate from U.S. and Asian markets, the\nrapid expansion of Internet cafes and broadband technologies will enable the\ngrowth of online gaming populations in other regions. For example, the fastest\ngrowing gaming markets are occurring in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.iii\n\n•\n\nGaming sales continue to increase by a compound annual rate of 19.1%. Sales\nsurpassed 23 billion USD in 2003 and are estimated to reach 56 billion USD by\n2008. In turn, revenues reached approximately $6 billion in 2004 and are\nprojected to reach $14.3 billion by 2009.iv\n\nPopularity\nGaming has emerged as the preeminent form of entertainment among 18 — 35 yearold males. Consequently, the gaming industry now rivals traditional entertainment\nindustries, including the film and music industries in terms of growth, revenue, and\nconsumption.v\n•\n\nFor example, the gaming industry is growing by 20% compared to 7.5%, 7.1%\nand 2% growth rates in the film, television, and music industries during the same\nperiod. Furthermore, AC Nielson predicts that within four years, the film industry\nwill be just one-third the size of the computer game market vi\n\n•\n\nGame users typically spend 20-30 hours per week on online games and more than\n20% of online gamers identify themselves as residents of virtual worlds vii\n\n•\n\nThe stereotype of the lonely gamer spending long hours in social isolation is no\nlonger tenable. While some games are played by singular or a group of isolated\nplayers, computer gaming now is increasingly social with the growth of Local\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 6\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nArea Network (LAN) games played in Internet cafes and the expansion of\nmassively online multiplayer games (MMOG). Users are now interacting with\nothers in the game (i.e. guilds), online in other cyber media (i.e. web sites,\nmessage boards and social networking sites) and in cybercafés providing a fertile\nground for terrorist activities.\n•\n\nIt is widely thought that online gaming may have a similar cultural, political, and social\ninfluence on today's gamers that music, religion and politics had on earlier generations. viii\n\nGlobal Patterns in Game Play: Time Spent, Social Interaction and Reach\nGames consume a great deal of time and effort by a significant number ofplayers around the world. In a\nstudy done by Nick Yee at Stanford University on Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games\n(MMORPG) users, 50% of the 30,000 respondents worked full time, with only 22% as full-time students.\nThe average age of the respondents was 26.5, (women tended to be older than me) and on average the\nrespondents spent 22.71 hours per week in their chosen MMORPG, a time involvement which suggests\nthat there is a substantial level of emotional investment in the MMORPG environment.\n\nGlobal Market\n\nCounter-Strike is considered the most popular online first-person shooter\n(FPS) game in the world with the more than 200,000 players playing\nsimultaneously and contributing more than 5.5 billion minutes of playing\ntime each month on the official network consisting of more than 100,000\nservers. Counter-Strike is played extensively throughout Central,\nSoutheast, and Southwest Asia in addition to the core U.S., European and\nAsian markets.\n\nPalestinian\nMarket\n\nReportedly, more than 25% of children between the ages of 6 and 17 in the\nPalestinian territories access the Internet through Internet centers that have\nemerged in refugee camps, rural villages, and urban areas. Palestinian\nInternet center managers and computer lab owners have reported that most\nchildren spend most of their time playing online games, including \"proArab\" games like Special Force and Under Siege.\n\nSouthwest &\nSoutheast\nAsian Markets\n\nKuma Games produces and distributes episodic games depicting real life\nmilitary operations. These games are played throughout Southeast and\nSouthwest Asia. During the height of media coverage on Middle East\nnetworks like Al-Jazeera, 20% of Kuma's total audience originated from\nthe Middle East region with significant amounts of game traffic coming\nfrom Egypt and a notable number of players originating from Iran and Iraq.\n[See: End Note xxvii]\n\nPage 7\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFunctionality of Online Games\nGames are platforms on which participants may communicate, coordinate,\nsocialize, train, learn, simulate, experiment, build, proselytize and even barter virtual\ngoods. Such functions indicate that the line between the 'virtual' world and the 'real'\nworld is blurring, and to some users may be non-existent.\n•\n\nThat virtual worlds are becoming synonymous with the real world, provides and\ninteresting opportunity for terrorists to conduct a range of activities with\nanonymity.\n\nAs virtual worlds become more popular, pervasive, and sophisticated, so too will\nterrorist opportunities to exploit them.\n•\n\nFor example, as gaming becomes increasingly popular across multiple\ndemographics and access to various gaming platforms increases (i.e. access to\npersonal computers, Internet cafes, and mobile platforms), it will become easier\nfor terrorist groups to reach core target audiences. For these reasons, many expect\nthat terrorist groups will increasingly leverage online and computer based games\nto support their activities in the future.\n\nPropaganda\n\nand\n\nInfluence\n\nTerrorist groups and sympathizers could use games to twist historical context,\ndemonize enemies, disrupt the social moral compass, and desensitize users to\nviolence\n•\n\nGames designed to appeal to terrorist sympathizers leverage salient political\nthemes and typically exploit \"pro-Arab\" and \"anti-Israel\" sentiment. Such games\nattract players because they provide them with a consonant message and an\nopportunity to take part 'virtually' in \"resistance movements.\" x\n\n•\n\nSpecial Force, developed by Hezbollah, plays on the common themes of \"Israeli\noccupation\" and \"Palestinian victimization,\" and offers players the opportunity to\n'fight back' by 'digitally' reenacting various elements of the Intifada. For\ninstance, the introductory level of Special Force involves target practice and\nshooting exercises, using images of Israeli Generals as the mark. Later levels\ninvolve the 'digital' reenactment of battles that have occurred between the IDF\nand Palestinians during the Israeli occupation xi\n\n•\n\nSpecial Force was intentionally designed by Hezbollah to reinforce and\ndisseminate the group's values, concepts, and ideas among supporters and\nsympathizers, while giving passive supporters the opportunity to experience the\nviscera of the front lines xii Special Force is available in Arabic, French, English,\nand Farsi, and thus is widely available to traditional Hezbollah audiences and\nothers.xiii\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 8\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n•\n\nUnder Ash and its sequel Under Siege were published by the Syrian company Dar\nal-Fikr. The player takes the role of a Palestinian national opposing the occupiers\nfrom Israel. Under Siege, in particular, is based on actual events, but is presented\nfrom the Syrian perspective. The game employs visceral imagery and sound,\nincluding scenes of Palestinian children being murdered, summary executions\nbeing held in public streets, high-speed chase scenes and sounds of gunfire and\nheart pumping music. The scenes too are designed to evoke outrage and to play\non common themes, including \"Israeli occupation,\" \"Injustice,\" and \"Revenge\".\n\n•\n\nThe Iranian Islamic Students Association has also developed an online game,\nCommander Bahman, in which users play the role of a special-forces unit tasked\nwith protecting Iranian nuclear capabilities from American aggression. This\ngame was developed in direct response to a Kuma Reality Games release, Assault\non Iran. Kuma has subsequently developed another installment, Assault on Iran,\nPt.3, in the hopes that this international dialogue, sparked by the depiction of\nglobal affairs in the game space, will continue. Assault on Iran, Pt. 3 is planned\nbe released in Arabic, English, and Farsi xiv\n\nVideo games make particular assumptions within their environment that can\ntranscend a specific message to users.\n•\n\nFor example, the games Ummah Defense and Ummah Defense II (free for\ndownload on the Internet), are set in the future, based on the premise that at some\npoint in history Muslims will have conquered the world and killed or converted\nall non-Muslims. Users act as a member of the Intergalactic Muslim Council,\nworking to protect Earth from the sole disbeliever and in his army of robots sent\nto destroy the Earth - it was necessary to construct robots as all other humans\nbelieve in Islam. The overarching message is that establishment of the caliphate\nis possible.xv Playing games within this context allows users to experience this\nreality in a sensory way that makes the message \"real.\"\n\nVideo games are an ideal influence platform because they incorporate imagery,\nnarrative, camaraderie, and action.\n•\n\nThis combination works because advanced imagery and graphics can be used to\nengage the senses, storylines can be used to provide a context and group goals,\ncamaraderie in the form of multiple players facilitates higher levels of\nengagement, and action in the form of participation is required xvi\n\nRadical groups are using gaming platforms to propagate religious ideology. This\ncan take place in a number of different ways. For example, a FPS game can help\ndemonize a declared enemy, while educational games can offer manipulated religious\ndoctrine as scripture.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 9\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n•\n\nFor example, Innovative Minds, Inc. has developed a series of six 'multi-level'\ndownloadable games, entitled \"Islamic Fun\" which are aimed at \"teaching\nchildren between the ages of 5 and 11 years of age about Islam.\" \"Islamic Fun\" is\nmarketed as a \"faith-based\" alternative to \"secular\" games and includes many age\nappropriate game titles, including Fishing Bear, Tree Hop, and Two Bunny Race.\nHowever, embedded in this game package is another game, entitled The\nResistance, in which users assume the role of farmers in Southern Lebanon who\njoin the Islamic Resistance against invading Israelis.xvii Many believe that these\ntypes of games encourage anti-Semitism and promote terrorism xviii\n\nCommunications\nGames provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups and sympathizers\nbecause in-game conversations often are difficult or impossible to monitor.\n•\n\nMany games contain capabilities like VoIP, chat, and file transfers that allow real-time\ncommunications to take place, and few sites monitor such traffics or keep log files as\nwould traditional Internet service providers (ISPs).\n\n•\n\nMassively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) are ideal locations to support secure\nterrorist communications because of the enormous scale on which they are played. At a\ngiven time thousands of subscribers can be connected to a virtual world on various game\nservers. Potentially complicating matters are that some games can be hosted by gamers\non their own dedicated server or PC.\n\n•\n\nIn-game communication channels would be difficult to collect by current Internet\ncontrol methods, because speech and text mingles with data from the game. This\nincreases the chances that authorities will overlook communications they would\nnormally prohibit.\n\nRecruitment\nOnline gaming can serve as a recruiting tool. This has already proven true in the\nUS, as the US Army found that 28% of players logging on to play its, \"America's Army\"\nonline game also visited the corresponding recruitment site.\n•\n\nMonitoring strategy games like Counterstrike can be an effective way to track\nindividual skill levels in firearms, tactical operations, group cohesion, leadership,\netc. This information can then be used by interested parties to evaluate\nqualifications for military or insurgent recruitment.\n\n•\n\nParticipation in virtual communities can facilitate off-line activity. Members of\nterrorist groups could enter or monitor online game environments with the intent\nof translating 'virtual' skills and actions into real world commitments and\nactivities.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 10\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nTraining and\n\nSimulation\n\nGames can supplement field training by familiarizing recruits with the tactics,\nweaponry, and skills needed to conduct operations. Military type games can be used to\nhelp acquire skills in team work, communications, leadership, and operational tactics.\nThis trend is likely to manifest itself in the near future, as games are increasingly\nleveraging real time data from the battle field.\n•\n\nCulturally accurate games can help foreign terrorists avoid profile raising\nmistakes and assist in assimilation.\n\n•\n\nCombat simulators, such as those developed by BBN Technologies as part of the\nPentagon's DARWARS project, are used to help soldiers bound for Iraq prepare\nfor combat. Among the offerings: DARWARS Ambush! a combat simulation\ngame designed to train up to 24 soldiers at a time in military convoy operations.xix\n\n•\n\nIncreasingly realistic virtual environments further blur the lines between the\nvirtual and real worlds - these environments create immersive environments that\ndraw users into the game world. This results in more true-to-life training grounds,\nand enhances a game's underlying message as the user experience becomes more\nimmersive.\n\n•\n\nThe US military is currently using games as a tool to equip personnel with\ntraining in numerous key areas including, tactical planning, mission rehearsal,\nincorporating lessons learned, and tactical language training. xx\n\n•\n\nCOTS programs used to develop combat simulators are inexpensive, widely\navailable, and could offer terrorist groups the opportunity to simulate attacks prior\nto their execution. Such programs could enable fairly accurate damage\nassessments and provide insight into necessary course correction to limit risk and\nunintended consequences associated with a particular attack. For example, the\nMaya Unlimited fluid simulation software, available for $159, offers users the\nability to re-create the mushroom cloud caused by a nuclear explosion. Users can\ncontrol the influence of fuel and other attributes, and add key ingredients such as\ntemperature scale, buoyancy, dissipation, turbulence, and diffusion.\n\n•\n\nGames could also be used as part of the attack plan itself. With the rise of mobile\ngaming, terrorist groups can use the platform to its advantage; instead of planting\na bomb near a crowd of people, for example, it can place one at a random location\nand lead game players to the bomb.\n\nThis is speculative based on flash mobs and mobile gaming use. Flash mobs are groups of people that\nconverge in public places for brief periods of time and dissipate quickly there after. Flash mobs have\noccurred worldwide and are frequently organized around political protest efforts. The French riots of 2005\nwere organized largely through flash mob efforts. Paired with mobile scavenger hunting location based or\nmixed reality games, flash mobs have the potential to concentrate people rapidly at the site of the \"win.\"\nSee stories on flash mobs: http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3056735.00.html;\nhttp://in.rediff.com/netguide/2003/oct/05flash.htm. Some examples of location based games include:\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 11\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFundraising\nNewer games offer greater opportunities for terror groups to raise and distribute\nfunds. Funds used in online games can be uploaded in one location and downloaded in\nanother, which is particularly easy if multiple users can access a single ID.\n•\n\nThe goods, services, and currencies of virtual worlds have real-world impact. In\n2005, E-bay category 1654, \"Internet Games,\" had $30 million dollars in sales in\nthe United States. Similarly in Asia, real-cash virtual item trade exceeds $100\nmillion annually xxi Current estimates indicate that intangible goods in digital\nworlds are worth $1-$2 billion xxii\n\n•\n\nBecause users are able to create their own content in games, entrepreneurs profit\nin real-world dollars by selling professional services or goods. One virtual real\nestate mogul in Second Life makes nearly $150,000 per year in real-world dollars.\n\n•\n\nFund raising efforts are already happening in virtual worlds. In 2006, American\nCancer Society (ACS) held its second virtual Relay for Life in Second Life. ACS\ncollected over $40,000 and attracted nearly 1,000 participants.xxiii\n\n•\n\nIndividuals organize to raise funds for charitable efforts. After Hurricane Katrina,\nsome individuals banded together to hold live fundraising events in Second Life to\nhelp victims.xxiv\n\n•\n\nOrganizations could use virtual worlds as a vehicle for generating income. While\nthe money raised might not be enough to fund a sizable organization, it could be a\nrevenue source for smaller cells.\n\nEase of Production of Games\nThe growing availability of middleware or mods drastically lowers the barriers of\nentry for game development, allowing almost anyone to become a game builder.\nMiddleware products are available for a marginal fee (usually the cost of a game) or\ncan be downloaded free from the Internet.\n•\n\nMods are typically used to create additional content to games (partial\nconversions) or new games (total conversions). Popular middleware products\ninclude 3D world building packages such as Genesis 3D, Quake, Unreal, and\nHalf-Life; multiplayer adventure games like Aurora Toolkit; and systems for\nhandling massively multiplayer games like BigWorld, Butterfly.net, and\nTerazona.\n\nBotfighter series, Gunslinger series, Mogi, UnderCover series, Swordfish and Torpedo Bay, ConQwest,\nThe Journey II, and Treasure Hunt.

For example, unidentified gamers\nmodified the FPS game Battlefield 2 enabling players to take on the role of\nextremists whose home village in Iraq suffered collateral damage during a\nfictional US operation xxv\n\n•\n\nAnother prime example of the use of mods is the CD-ROM game Ethnic\nCleansing, produced by Resistance Records, to promote the white supremacy\nagenda. The game promotes the killing of \"sub-humans\" (other races and Jews)\nin a setting similar to New York City. The game is patterned after popular\nmainstream video games Quake and Doom, turning racially motivated violence\ninto a form of \"entertainment.\" Users are given the option of assuming the role of\na KKK Member or a Skinhead.\n\n•\n\nKuma Games develops free, episodic games for their users based on recent real\nworld events. With the assistance of the Valve's Source game engine,xxvi modular\nsoftware that provides enhancements in several key areas of game production,\nincluding character animation, advanced AI and real-world physics, Kuma is\neasily able to produce immersive, realistic games in little time. Additionally, in\nan effort to make the games more easily downloaded by users in the Middle East,\nKuma has developed a Persia Disk that can easily be copied and redistributed.\nUsing the disk, once the game design is loaded onto the user's PC, no Internet\nconnection is required to play, although a low-band connection is adequate to\nattain new episodes.xxvii\n\n•\n\nTerrorist groups likely could reduce development costs further by soliciting\nsympathizers with the required skill sets to work for free or reduce costs as their\ncontribution to the Jihad analogous to how religious game developers operate to\nreduce costs.xxviii College students provide a plausible target for recruitment.\n\nMachinima is film making within the real-time 3D virtual environment of a video\ngame. It's the use of video game graphics technology to create animated films.\nMachinima combines aspects of film making, animation and game design to transform an\ninteractive medium, a video game, into a production studio complete with sets, props,\nspecial effects and virtual actors. All that is required is a game and a desktop computer.^\nLike traditional movies, machinima allows for character development and the creation of\nplot lines.\nt For a machinima example that uses military characters and explains machinima, see\nMachinima!

Websites like\nwww.fraps.com provide trial versions of machinima software, such as the one\nused to produce \"Sonic Jihadxxix,\" and allow users to create quality machinima\nproductions. Productions, such as \"Sonic Jihad,\" which are made with trial\nversions of machinima software frequently place their websites directly in the\ncenter of the screen in order to drive people to their sites to purchase full versions.\nProductions like \"Sonic Jihad\" not only can promote propaganda, but direct\nsympathizers who wish to create similar productions to the software needed.\n\n•\n\nIn 2005, a machinima, \"French Democracy\" depicted the views of the minorities\nduring the French riots. The well-developed story carries a political message\nallowing one to sympathize with the minority position in the riots. The\nmachinima was produced on November 22, just 5 days after the riots ended.\n\n•\n\nSimilar to using mods to develop games, real-time video capture software, like\nFraps, allows users to record video of the activity taking place on one's PC,\nduring game play, for example. Once downloaded, this software \"records\" to\ncapture audio and video bits up to 1152x864 and 100 frames per second.xxx The\nuse of such software in games like Kuma/Wars would allow users to develop\nmachinima productions of recent combat events adding their own twist.\nFeatures of Fraps Real-time Video Capture Software\nScreen capturing - Digital images taken by the software recording the visible\nitems on the monitor as a screenshot in formats such as BMP, PNG and JPG.\nReal-time video capturing - Digital images taken by the software recording the\nvisible items on the monitor (or another visual output device) over an extended\nperiod of time, as the action is taking place, to form a video file.\nScreencast/Screen Recording - Digital recording of a computer screen output,\noften containing audio narration.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 14\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 15\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nChapter Introduction\nGames are an effective influence platform because they promote both \"active\" and\n\"passive\" learning, and are highly attractive pursuits for specific target audiences.\nGames, by nature, are learning experiences. Playing a game involves building skills\nin order to advance to new levels in the game.\n•\n\nTraditional teaching and conditioning methods are used to teach and develop the\nplayer.\n\n•\n\nLearning is central to a player's in-game success.xxxi\n\nLearning in games can be transparent (e.g. helping to refine a player's shooting\ntechnique) or hidden (developing a predisposition in a player toward a particular cause or\nmessage).\n•\n\nThe latter often involves the promotion within the game of a particular set of\nvalues or ideologies via the storyline or setting, and the use of emotional \"tools\"\nto elicit particular reactions.\n\nFinally, games can be effective influence platforms because they are popular,\ncaptivating players and encouraging them to return for more.\nVideo games are \"weaponized\" texts, or disrupters of psychic stability.. .I mean to say\nthat games perform what Pierre Bourdieu calls \"symbolic violence\"—in other words, that\n\"gentle, invisible form of violence, which is never recognized as s u c h . \" . Like\neducational institutions, video games are instances of symbolic violence in the sense that\nthey inflict themselves on players. The world of the video game is nothing more than the\non-screen rendering of programmed instructions and decrees. Players are \"schooled\" by\nan aggressive bombardment of pixellated images and sounds. Every moment is a direct\nimperative, an attack that demands a response.\n-- Matt Garite,\nThe Ideology of Interactivity (or, Video Games and the Taylorization of Leisure) XXX11\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 16\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nActive Learning\nGames can serve as a place to learn, imparting knowledge and teaching skills. The\nstructure of games promotes learning through a rewards system.\n•\n\nOften, games require action without expertise, forcing players to experiment and\nlearn.\n\n•\n\nGames also can reinforce previous learning experiences by allowing players to\ninteract with issues, ideologies, products and events in active and passive ways.\n\nKnowledge\n\nand Skills\n\nGames can serve as a place to learn, imparting knowledge and teaching skills.\n•\n\nDuring prehistoric times, hunting games were used to teach young people how to\nhandle dangerous situations in the wild.\n\n•\n\nToday, games are often more complex, involving dynamic platforms,\nsophisticated storylines, and diverse goals.\n\n•\n\nIndividuals progress through an entire learning cycle when playing a game,\nbeginning with openness to new situations and rules, then taking certain actions\nand reflecting on them, and finally \"learning\" how to operate successfully in the\ngame (see Figure 1).\n\n•\n\nOften the learning process continues outside the game in such ways as\nconversations with friends, participation on fan websites, reading about the\ngames, and player meet-ups online xxxiii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 17\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nExhibit 2-1: The Learning Frameworkxxxiv\n\nApplication of the Learning Framework to Games\n\n1. Openness: When an individual plays a game, he is open to its structures, rules and\nmessages.\n2. Action: By nature, games present a problem that a player must address and act on in\norder to advance in the game. Actions must take place within the rules and value\nsystems of the game (in this diagram, the game is represented by the box\n\"Environment\") in order for the player to participate and move forward in the game.\na. Manifestation: The player's desired outcome in the game is to succeed and\nmitigate losses.\nb. Influencing the external environment: The player takes action to try to\ninfluence the course of the game.\nc. Coaching: The rules of the game provide guidelines on how to take action and\nwhat is permissible and acceptable.\nd. Instinctive learning: When quick action is required, instincts will play a role in\nhow play is performed. This often includes a mix of: lessons learned from past\nexperiences, a player's personal values system, and physical and emotional\nreactions. This part of learning is generally subconscious.\ne. Nurturing the individual: Assessments about how well the player is playing\nthe game are made frequently throughout the game.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 18\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nf.\n\nConditioning: The player's actions result in an outcome, which can be the\ndesired outcome, a different yet positive outcome, or a negative outcome.\n\n3. Reflection: In the wake of the outcome, a player consciously or subconsciously\nmakes an assessment about what worked, what didn't work, what could be\nimproved, and how to take action differently in the future.\n4. Unlearning to Openness: Reflection enables the \"unlearning\" of decisions and\nactions taken in the previous game and creates openness to trying again to\nsucceed. This completes one learning cycle and starts another.\n\nThe structure of games promotes learning through a rewards system.\n•\n\nVideo and other games teach a \"correct\" course of action by providing immediate\nfeedback on a player's initial action. As discussed with regard to the learning\ncycle, players then reflect on their initial action in an effort to achieve a better\noutcome the next time they are faced with a similar situation in the game.\nLearning = Action + Feedback + Reflection xxxv\n\n•\n\nPlayers advance to higher levels in games by learning appropriate responses\nduring earlier stages of the game.

Games have already been exploited by terrorist extremists and\nsympathizers. Emerging trends within the game space suggest greater opportunities will\nexist for future exploitation enhancing a range of terrorist operations, from supporting\nstrategic propaganda and influence activities, to more highly instrumental uses such as\ncommunication, fundraising and recruitment.lix Such activities warrant concern given the\nincreasing popularity of gaming which seems to be transcending age, gender and cultural\nboundaries.\nPotential Uses of Games for Terrorist Activities\n•\n\nPropaganda and Influence - Terrorists and sympathizers use games to twist historical\ncontext, demonize enemies, disrupt the social moral compass, and propagate ideology.\n\n•\n\nCommunications - Games provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups\nand sympathizers because in-game conversations often are difficult to monitor.\n\n•\n\nRecruiting - Online gaming can serve as a recruiting tool. For example, the United States\nArmy found that 28% of players logging on to play its America's Army online game also\nvisi ted the corresponding recruitment site.\n\n•\n\nSimulation, Practice and Team Management - Games can supplement field training by\nfamiliarizing recruits with the tactics, weaponry, and skills needed to conduct operations\nand planning.\n\n•\n\nMoney Laundering and Fundraising - Funds used in online games can be uploaded in one\nloc ation and downloaded in another by using a single avatar to which multiple people have\naccess via ID and password. Alternately, virtual \"sweat shops\" can be organized to\n\nSeveral plausible scenarios exist where terrorist organizations could leverage the\npower of the gaming medium to achieve operational goals with minimal training and\nexpertise. This paper will outline the current capabilities and potential scenarios by game\ngenre demonstrating how a terrorist organization might exploit the game space. The\nextent to which games can be used by terrorist groups to supplement their other activities\ndepends on a variety of factors, to include:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nInternet connectivity of game users\nCost and availability of hardware and/or software required to play game\nLevel and kind of interaction between players that the game allows\nEase of use of game\nDegree of game skills transferability to real-world activity\nDegree of realism in game design (such as graphics and programming sophistication)\nBarriers to game production\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 26\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe effectiveness of carrying out terrorist activities through games varies by genre.\nEach of the scenarios presented offers the most effective use for its respective type of\ngame. The following chart gives an overview of each game genre and its effectiveness\nfor enabling a specific terrorist objective:\n\nExhibit 3-1: Best Uses of Game Genres in Influence Efforts§\n\nGenre of\nGame\nFirst-person\nShooter\nEducational\nSimulation\nMixed or\nAlternate\nReality\nMMORPGs\nor MUVEs\nStrategy\nGames\n\nEnable\nCommunication\n\nSimulation\nand\nTraining\n\nMoney\nLaundering/\nFund Raising\n\nPropaganda\nand Influence\n\nTool for\nRecruitment\nm\n\no\n\nm\n\no\n\nm\n\no\n\nm\n\nm\n\no\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\no\n\n•\n\nm\n\nm\n\n•\n\nm\n\nm\n\n•\n\nm\n\no\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\no\n\n< o\n\nd D Ideal or good use\nC 3 Could be used but requires moderate effort and would be only somewhat effective\nC D Could be used but would not be an effective choice from a cost/benefit standpoint\n\nNote: THE SCENARIOS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER ARE FICTITIOUS.

Give blood.\n\nGenerously\n\nExhibit 3-2: A view from the FPS game Half-life as the opponent is shot. Ix\n\nProducers often sophisticatedly incorporate various weapons in their FPS games. For\nexample, Alliance1x1 allows the user to choose an historic or contemporary weapon for use\nin game play. The game accurately portrays the benefits and drawbacks of the chosen\nweapon, as well as the correct velocity and trajectory of the ammunition.\nFirst-person Shooter Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A Sudanese Islamic extremist group develops a FPS game as a\ntool to influence audiences, train forces and raise funds. The game portrays local\nwarlords as corrupt. Players must take up arms to help defend their towns.\n•\n\nThe player must choose the correct weapon to fight the enemy and calculate when\nto reload the weapon, as well as how to move through the town safely and whom\nto trust. If the player shoots a civilian, the civilian will make a commotion and in\nmoments, the player will be shot - always.\n\n•\n\nAt the end of the game, when the player has either won or lost a round, a message\nreads, \"Real heroes are those who take action in everyday life. What have you\ndone to support your brothers and sisters today? Search the Net for the truth and\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 28\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\njoin the cause at www.youcanbeaterrorist.com, or by texting a message to cell\nphone number (98)22-123-4567 that includes the best way to contact you.\" The\ngame also offers postal and PayPal addresses if players would like to contribute\nfinancially to the cause.\n\nMMORPGs\n\nand Virtual\n\nWorlds\n\nMassive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) are online computer\nrole-playing games in which a large number of players interact with one another in a\nvirtual world. MMORPGs are distinguished from Role Playing Games by their\n\"persistence\", i.e. the virtual world continues to exist and evolve even when the player is\nnot playing the game.\n•\n\nLeading titles include EverQuest, Star Wars Galaxies, World of Warcraft,\nLineage, Mu, and The Legend of Mir.\n\nGuild In-game « Team at Worklxi\n\".. .A guild is a collection of players who come together to share knowledge, resources,\nand manpower. To run a large one, a guild master must be adept at many skills:\nattracting, evaluating, and recruiting new members; creating apprenticeship programs;\norchestrating group strategy; and adjudicating disputes. Guilds routinely splinter over\npetty squabbles and other basic failures of management; the master must resolve them\nwithout losing valuable members, who can easily quit and join a rival guild. Never mind\nthe virtual surroundings; these conditions provide real-world training a manager can\napply directly in the w o r k p l a c e . \"\n--Taken from:\nYou Play World of Warcraft? You're Hired!\nby John Seeley Brown and Douglas Thomas\nWired Magazine\n\nWhile MMORPGs involve undertaking missions that are eventually \"won\" or \"lost,\"\nvirtual worlds focus on daily activities and social interactions.\n•\n\nVirtual world environments allow users to communicate and participate in\nactivities simultaneously with other users regardless of the physical distance\nbetween them.\n\n•\n\nTypically producers establish a virtual world and allow users to develop space and\ndesign items within the world.\n\n**\n\nRPGs require players to undertake a role and play out a narrative in simulated 'worlds' with preprogrammed characters and quests. Players can customize their characters and then interact with other\nplayers to complete goals or quests. RPGs have been produced using both first-person and third-person\nperspectives. Some popular examples of this genre are Ultima, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and Fallout.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 29\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n•\n\nMany organizations currently use the virtual world of Second Life to conduct\ntraining workshops. A few organizations have used the virtual world to fundraise\nand build up groups with similar interests.\n\n•\n\nPopular examples of virtual worlds include Second Life, Cybertown, Habbo\nHotel, There, and Virtual Magic Kingdom.\n\nExhibit 3-3: Users are able to socialize In the virtual space Second Life.lxl\"\n\nVirtual World Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A sophisticated terrorist network j oins Second Life. On a\npassword-protected island of the virtual community, they construct replicas of sites that\nthey are interested in attacking, and carry out realistic, virtual dry runs of their attacks.\n•\n\nThey consider expanding their network and developing an on-going virtual\nterrorist training camp, complete with lessons on the manufacture of bombs, the\nproper use of artillery, and basic lessons on the most effective places to shoot a\nperson to mortally wound them.\n\nBecause virtual worlds can serve as a platform for hard-to-trace communications and\nprivate, sometimes password-protected meetings when members are separated by\ndistance, the terrorist network also utilizes the virtual space for cell management and\nmeetings.\n•\n\nThe meetings help ensure that members are accounted for on a regular basis while\ndrawing little attention to the gathering or the members' association.\n\n•\n\nVirtual interaction helps team members become familiar and develop trust with\ntheir teammates long before they meet face-to-face.\n\n•\n\nWorking together in games or virtual worlds build teams cohesion which\ntranslates into better synergies in real-world situations.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 30\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFrequent interaction with his network helps the leader monitor the level of his team\nmembers' commitment to the cause and ensure that they do not waver from the group's\ntactical and strategic missions. This also helps the leader prevent members from\n\"defecting\" or otherwise becoming a threat to the cell.\nSome of the terrorist network members living in a remote location with Internet access\nraise funds via \"gold farming,\" a virtual form of the \"sweat shop.\" Their laborers play\ngames to develop the best, strongest in-game characters which are then sold online for a\nprofit at sites like E-bay.^\n•\n\nBecause of the games' entertainment value, terrorist network members encourage\nplayers to \"work\" for them or raise funds themselves by simply playing games\nand then selling items.\n\nOther network associates participate in traditional fundraising. Second Life allows players\nto contact the organizer of like-groups, perhaps \"humanitarian\" organizations that support\nparticular causes, and send mass emails to encourage participation in special interest\nevents. Donations are laundered to fund terror activities.\n•\n\nTerrorist groups are introduced to new sympathizers in this way.\n\n•\n\nOther associates hold invitation-only \"town meetings\" or \"group meetings\" to\nimpress viewpoints upon potential recruits.\nVirtual Worlds and MMORPGs as a Film Set\nMachinima: From Game space to Video\n\nGaming can serve as a platform for propaganda video production. For example,\nmachinima is filmmaking within the real-time 3D virtual environment of a video game.\nAll that is required is a game and a desktop computer.lxiv The combination of machinima\nsoftware and a virtual world or video game such as Planet Battlefield, allows one to film\ntheir in-game activities as they play to develop a film which is easily distributed over the\nInternet.\nTerrorists could easily exploit this technology. Through the use of virtual\ncharacters and audio mash-ups a terrorist could anonymously create machinima films that\nincluded speeches, updates, and briefings. He could use the technology of virtual\ncommunities to create target sites to convey to cell members the next planned attack, use\ngames to give a visual plan of how the attack should be carried out, and familiarize\nteammates with the terrain of the intended site with the technology of Second Life.\nAdditionally, one could use machinima to create a likable, militant hero with whom their\ntarget audience could identify.\n\n^ During the month of December, SAIC analysts periodically checked e-Bay for characters and items for\nsale. It was common to see a high-level character with special skills in World of Warcraft or Everquest on\nsale for approximately US$2,000 with only minutes left in the auctions.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 31\n\n\fG a m e s : A L o o k at E m e r g i n g Trends, U s e s , Threats and O p p o r t u n i t i e s in I n f l u e n c e Activities\n\nThis technology, combined with audio mash-ups, also could be easily used to\nincorporate the voices of key heads of state, the US President for example, into anti-US\npropaganda.

Cell member #1 buys a component of the bomb near Reno, Nevada. He then\nstashes his purchase for the next member to find in south-central Nevada.\n2. Cell member #2 knows only the code name of cell member #1. He knows that #1\nwill be hiding a partially built bomb that requires the component that he has\nbought. He watches and waits for a posting by #1 of a location within the\npredetermined 100 miles from his base. When #1 posts, he rushes out to find the\ncache, takes the developing bomb, adds his component, and takes it to a place\nwithin 100 miles of the south-eastern Utah-Nevada border.\n3. Cell member #3 repeats the same process as cell member #2. This process\ncontinues until the bomb is completed.\n4. The final cell member takes the bomb to the naval watch station and detonates it\nas planned. No red flags were raised because the transport and purchase of the\nbomb components were spread out across four states.\nExhibit 3-7: Geocaching Construction and Transportation Scenario\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 35\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nSimulation\n\nGames\n\nSimulation games allow gamers a chance to experience and practice a role, activity or\nskill in the safety of the virtual world. Popular experiences in these games include flying,\nracing, sporting, and building.\n•\n\nThere are many kinds of users of simulation games. For example, to train soldiers\nthe United States military uses simulation games including flight simulators,\nurban warfare simulations, and even communication simulations for deployment\nin foreign countries.\n\n•\n\nLikewise, terrorist cells could use simulation games for communication,\nrecruitment and team management as well as for dry-runs of missions.\n\n•\n\nSome of the most successful titles include Microsoft Flight Simulator, Gran\nTurismo, Madden NFL, and SimCity.\n\nSimulation Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist leader wants to stage a biological and chemical\nattack on several Washington, DC, Metro stations simultaneously. The cell leader would\nlike to simulate all stages of such an attack including the construction, transportation and\nimplementation of the plan. Basic benefits of a simulated attack include:\n•\n\nCell members use virtual simulation to monitor times and locations to carry out\nan attack across multiple stations.\n\n•\n\nCell members use virtual simulation to case the environment prior to the attack in\norder to identify and mitigate potential obstacles.\n\n•\n\nThe cell leader is able to integrate digital imagery and simulated sounds to\nacclimate operators in order that they execute the attack more effectively.\n\nMapping programs such as Google earth can be integrated into online simulation games\nto reconstruct streets, buildings and other topographical features near potential attack\nsites.\n•\n\nThe cell leader integrates information provided by the city inspector's office,\nincluding actual building codes and utility locations to generate more accurate\ngame construction.\n\nA software program that simulates hospital and laboratory environments is uploaded into\nthe game space. The software is intended for training medical staff and laboratory\ntechnicians about safe handling and storage of dangerous chemicals and biological\nagents. It also trains first responders on containing spills. Cell members use this\nprogram to learn safe handling, transport and deployment of the chemical and biological\nagents they will use.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 36\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nUtilizing actual plans for the Metro system provide insight into tunnel and station\nstructures. Such plans accurately portray the location and significance of key power\nsources, ventilation ducts, and other infrastructure features critical to an effective\nbiological attack.\n•\n\nThe cell leader utilizes software that scans the structural and architectural plans of\nkey structures to create a 3-D virtual metro system. He then places the virtual\nMetro system on a password protected island in a virtual world and shares the\npassword with other cell members.\n\nAdditional details are entered into the virtual metro station using the same techniques.\nCell members casing the 'real' metro system identify security checks, including camera\nand video installations and then program their locations.\n•\n\nBy integrating these systems into the simulated metro system, the cell members\nidentify and overcome obstacles through trial and error. Identifying and inputting\npassenger traffic patterns through the Metro system further enables accuracy in\nplanning and executing attacks.\n\n•\n\nThe breadth of data and sophistication of the software programs allows the cell to\nperform damage assessments against each scenario to help predict which\nconditions would be most effective in delivering a chemical or biological\ninfections.\n\nThrough their dry runs, experimentation and practice, the simulation, in its entirety,\ndetermine the optimal operation while maximizing the effectiveness and impact.\nAs the scenarios are being planned and practice, the cell leader obtains sensors to monitor\ncell members' biological responses. Further, some games have features that allow\nleaders to monitor player statistics.\n•\n\nHe hooks the cell members up to these sensors and has them perform various\ntasks related to the simulation and monitors their responses.\n\n•\n\nThis helps the cell member determine the roles of the members based on their\nnatural responses.\n\n•\n\nIt also helps identify training or conditioning that must occur before the mission.\n\n•\n\nThe cell member also tracks player performance and time spent in the simulation\nthrough in-game player performance statistics.\n\nThrough the cell's dry runs, the team becomes comfortable with their roles during the\nmission, thereby reducing the margin of error.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 37\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n•\n\nEach member knows their roles and what their colleagues will be doing\nsimultaneously.\n\n•\n\nThey practice scenarios that may occur during the mission and determine how to\nact.\n\n•\n\nThey are now less susceptible to surprises.\n\nThrough research and in-game simulation, it is determined that maximum impact can be\nexpected using three bombers in each of four Metro stations -- Metro Center, Gallery\nPlace, Union Station, Capitol South, and L'Enfant -- at 8:45 AM on a Tuesday in lateMarch. Each cell member knows their responsibilities and the timing on their\nmovements.\n\nKnowledge-Based\n\nGames\n\nKnowledge-based games are a proven success in teaching. Many organizations have\nbegun to develop video and other games to teach children about their work or mission.\n•\n\nThe United Nations, for example, provides Food Force for free via the UN\nwebsite. The game aims to teach children about global hunger and food aid.\n\n•\n\nLikewise, Middle Eastern groups have attempted to influence children via games.\nThe Islamic Fun suite contains the game The Resistance which carries the\nfollowing introduction to the game, \"You are a farmer in South Lebanon who has\njoined the Islamic Resistance to defend your land and family from the invading\nZionists.\"\n\n•\n\nOther popular titles include Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Blue's\nClues: Blues Big Musical and, one of the first educational video games, Oregon\nTrail.\n\nKnowledge-Based Game Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade would like to teach children about\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The group knows that vivid, interactive games are likely\nto entertain children while providing an effective education platform. They develop a\ngame from the Palestinian point-of-view that distorts history by embellishing atrocities\ncommitted by the Israelis, and minimizing culpability of the Palestinians.\n• In order to win the game, the young player must answer questions correctly to\nsave his family and friends.\n•\n\nA correct answer, as deemed by the sympathizer, gets the child one step closer to\nParadise.\n\n•\n\nDuring each scenario, there are questions about religion, Israeli beliefs and moral\nresponsibility [see below].\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 38\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nIn-game Quiz\n\nExample:\n\nThe Israeli military on the Palestinian border is positioned there to:\nA.\nB.\nC.\n\nProvide protection for all non-military citizens crossing the border between Israel and\nPalestine regardless of nationality or religion.\nProtect all Christian non-military citizens.\nProtect all Christians and kill Muslims, including women and children to\nprevent the creation of more Islamic people and to slowly claim land that is not\ntheirs.\n•\n\nWhen children answer three quiz questions right, they progress to the next moral\ndilemma in the game - they are presented with a scenario out of \"history.\" Based\non the scenario presented, they must choose the right moral action to continue on\nwith their journey towards Paradise [see Interactive Story Example below].\n\nInteractive Story Example:\nIsraeli soldiers came to your home last night. You saw the men coming in time to take\ncover behind the house with your three-year-old brother. Your mother, older sister, and\nfather where brutally attacked and killed.

He is a member of the\nIslamic resistance and offers to help you avenge the murder of your family. He assures\nyou that if you choose to join the jihad you will have the opportunity to fight and should\nyou sustain any injury, he promises you that your youngest brother will be cared for.\nTime is of the essence, however, and the freedom fighters are expecting your decision\ntonight. What will you do?\nYour options are:\nA. Refuse their offer.\nYou thank the freedom fighter, but resign yourself to live under Israeli occupation.\nfather would understand.

Not respond to the offer.\nYour family has already been destroyed and you do not want to worsen the situation.\nBeware, however, as your failure to join the Islamic resistance essentially means that you\nare complying with the Zionist occupation.\nC.\n\nJoin the resistance and offer yourself as a suicide bomber.\nYou begin training today.\nYou volunteer to serve the jihad as a suicide bomber. This is an honorable post. You will\nbe rewarded and your family will be protected. You will be a hero in your community.\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 39\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nWhen you carry out your mission, you cause the death of the Israeli soldiers who killed\nyour mother, sister and father. You are celebrated as a hero throughout the\nneighborhood. Your brother is taken care of and respected for your sacrifice.\n\nStrategy\n\nGames\n\nStrategy games focus on careful planning and resource management in order to\nachieve victory. Many of these games can be likened to traditional tabletop war games,\noccurring in either a turn-based or real-time situation.\n•\n•\n\nReal time strategy games (RTS) have become the predominant game in this genre.\nPopular titles in turn-based or real-time strategy games include Starcraft,\nWarcraft, Civilization, Master of Orion, Command & Conquer, and Age of\nEmpires.\n\nTraditionally, strategy games have focused on military movements. In today's\ninformation technology environment however, strategy games teach business\nmanagement and negotiation skills.\n•\n\nTerrorists might use strategy games to teach new leaders fundraising techniques,\nmission planning, and how to manipulate cell members into complete missions.\n\nStrategy Game Scenario\nThis scenario is fictitious. A terrorist group would like to engage younger players and\ndistribute propaganda to a segment of the population that will be important in future Jihad\nefforts. The group would like to also determine if there are any players that fit the profile\nof their recruiters.\nThe terrorist group develops a game that simulates the duties and camaraderie of their\nIslamic brothers in Jihad. The terrorists build into the game lodging, rank and file roles,\nbenefits of those roles and a weapons structure that allows players with higher status to\nhave better weapons. The strategy in the game is to not only overcome their enemies (in\nthis case a corrupt official police force) but they must also become leaders of their\nbrothers to obtain better weapons and benefits within the group. The setting of the game\nbegins when a young, strong Iraqi sees neighbor after neighbor murdered by corrupt\npolice.\n•\n\nThe player must build citizen armies to counter the corrupt police forces.\n\n•\n\nThe player must train his troops, as well as raise funds.\n\n•\n\nHe must avoid the crowd turning against him.\n\nThe game is distributed for free to reach the greatest number of people and can be played\namongst other members by connecting to the Internet. Members of the terrorist group\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 40\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nwhich produced the game also play the game and assess other players' strategy skills and\ncommitment to the cause. Cell members engage the players in conversation to determine\ninformation about them and ultimately determine if they would be a good candidate for\nrecruitment.\n\nChapter Addendum\nThis paper discusses possible terrorist use of different types of games in training,\nplanning, recruiting, communications, fundraising, and propaganda efforts. While all of\nthese scenarios are possible in many areas of the world, only some may be possible in\nareas where Internet connectivity, hardware, or other dependencies are limited.\n•\n\nA follow-on study might discuss location-specific scenarios in target areas.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 41\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 42\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nChapter Introduction\nEmerging trends in the gaming space will have profound effects on the industry,\nfueling its expansion into previously untapped markets and affording terrorist\norganizations greater opportunities to reach and target core audiences.\n•\n\nEmerging trends in the gaming industry will be used to the advantage of groups\ncommitted to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals. ^ Terrorist\norganizations have already demonstrated the capability to utilize technological\nadvances to enhance their operations as demonstrated with their extensive use of\nthe Internetlxvi. As emerging trends come to fruition in burgeoning markets, it is\nonly a matter of time before terrorist organizations further exploit these trends in\nthe gaming space for similar purposes.\n\n•\n\nThe multiple uses of an expanded game space will be numerous, and from the\nterrorists' perspective, invaluablelxvii. Terrorist will be able use the enhanced\ngame space to conduct a range of operations, from supporting strategic\npropaganda and influence activities, to more highly instrumental uses such as\ncommunication, fundraising and recruitment. §§\n\nEmerging trends in the gaming industry will continue to drive culture, technology\nand creativity in both mature and previously untapped markets. They are expected to\nserve as a catalyst for the gaming industry's rapid growth across age, gender and\ncultural boundaries.\n•\n\nMany emerging gaming trends are enabled by the spread of existing\ntechnologies and the advent of new ones. Three major technological drivers\npropelling the gaming industry into untapped markets will be the diffusion of\nbroadband Internet access, the maturation of the mobile platform, and the fruition\nof reliable wireless communication networks such as Third Generation (3G) and\nFourth Generation (4G) networks. Collectively, these trends will improve access\nand make online gaming in nascent markets a reality.\n\n•\n\nEmerging trends will continue to spur the gaming space ensuring its growth\ncontinues at near exponential rates.\nEvidence of trends spurring the gaming\nindustry can be seen in the growth of virtual worlds like Lineage, Everquest,\nWorld of Warcraft (WOW) and Second Life. Hugely popular, these virtual worlds\nhave evolved due to technological advances such as the evolution in Computing\nProcessing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), peak throughput\n\n^ Gabriel Weimann makes this point regarding the Internet but his argument can be extended to the game\nspace due to many similarities between the two mediums. For more information, see Weimann, Gabriel.\n\"www.terror.net: How Modern Terrorism Uses the Internet\" United States Institute of Peace, Special\nReport 116.\nOnline gaming has been growing at rapid rates in both mature and nascent markets, in particular within\nVirtual Worlds.

Newer technologies and emerging consumer usage\npatterns are expected to continue to spur growth in the future within the gaming\nsector.\n•\n\nChanges have occurred at a rapid pace within the gaming space and emerging\ntrends indicate more changes are forthcominglxviii. Many trends will change how\nplayers interact with games and with each other through games as trends come to\nfruition. As interactive gaming changed how an entire generation saw itself in\nrelation to the world in mature markets, it will also likely change how generations\nsee themselves in nascent markets.''''\n\n•\n\nThe overall impact of emerging trends in burgeoning markets is expected to\nmirror the experience of more mature markets, though marked differences will\nexist. Gaming will become a powerful medium, playing an important host to a\nrange of ordinary human affairs, particularly in the online space.\nLike the\nUnited States and Asian experience, the line between the virtual and real world\nwill blur for some and become non-existent for otherslxix However, noticeable\ndifferences will emerge, particularly in consumer usage patterns such as gaming\nplatforms (i.e. personal computers, consoles, and handheld devices) and access\nmethods (i.e. Internet Cafes and wireless networks) due to the limitations\nassociated with existing infrastructures and costs of deploying new ones.§§§\n\n' ' ' The impact of interactive gaming has profound effects beyond the game space. Evidence can be seen in\nhow gamers learn, problem solve and relate to the real world.

Industry analysts expect the growth of high speed Internet to initially\nbe more limited to Internet Cafes in the Middle East and Africa as opposed to\nindividual households due to the expense associated with deploying fixed-line or\n'wired' infrastructures. Consequently, industry analysts expect broadband\nwireless solutions to play a larger role in driving gaming in these markets,\nparticularly with the launch of Third Generation (3G) wireless services.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 45\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nBroadband\n2002\n2003\nBroadband Subscribers U.S.\nOnline Video Game\nSubscribers - U.S.\nBroadband Subscribers Asia\nOnline Video Game\nSubscribers - Asia\nBroadband Subscribers EMEA\n\nGrowth Drives Online\n2004 2005p 2006p\n\nGaming lxxiv\n2007p 2008p\n\n2009p\n\n2010p\n\nCAGR*\n\n62.0\n\n45.1\n\n38.3\n\n22.2\n\n17.6\n\n15.2\n\n11.5\n\n11.3\n\n9.9\n\n13.10\n\n77.8\n\n75.0\n\n50.0\n\n38.1\n\n32.8\n\n24.7\n\n20.8\n\n16.4\n\n14.8\n\n21.7\n\n84.6\n\n54.2\n\n62.2\n\n38.3\n\n26.5\n\n27.6\n\n22.4\n\n16.5\n\n13.6\n\n21.2\n\n133.3\n\n71.4\n\n66.7\n\n50.0\n\n33.3\n\n25.0\n\n32.0\n\n24.2\n\n19.5\n\n26.7\n\n105.8\n\n75.7\n\n113.3\n\n31.2\n\n26.4\n\n20.0\n\n16.3\n\n12.6\n\n10.9\n\n17.1\n\nOnline Video Game\nSubscribers - EMEA\n150.0 180.0\n78.6\n*CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate\n\n60.0\n\n50.0\n\n50.0\n\n33.3\n\n25.0\n\n20.0\n\n35.1\n\nExhibit 4-1: Comparison of Broadband and Online\nGrowth Rates in US, Asia and EMEA\nmarkets.\n\nGaming\n\nThe advent of high speed internet access fundamentally transformed gaming into a\ntruly networked experience making gaming an online social experience.\n•\n\nBroadband connectivity makes the stereotype of the lonely gamer spending long\nhours in social isolation no longer tenable.

This trend can already be seen in parts\nof the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar where they are\ntesting 3G services following its successful introduction in Bahrain and\nIsrael.lxxx\n\n•\n\nThe emergence of Wi-Fi hot spots are also an important development for\ngaming. In many parts of the world, cities are deploying Wi-Fi hot spots to\nincrease network connectivity and in some instances gaming companies are\npartnering with telecommunications firms. For instance, Nintendo recently\npartnered with BT Openzone to establish hot spots in the UK to enable mobile\ngaming.lxxxi\n\nThe Maturation\n\nof the Mobile\n\nPlatform\n\nRapid growth of the mobile market in mature and emerging regions will expand the\nreach of the mobile gaming space exponentially.\n•\n\nStrong growth is expected in the mobile sector with expansion rates ranging\nfrom 30% to 35% a year, bringing the industry's value to an estimated worth of\nUS$6 billion by 2010.lxxxii Rapid growth in the mobile industry will continue to\nbe spurred by the explosion of 'data' applications (i.e. text, ring tones, streaming\nvideo) to include gaming and the further convergence of these applications,\ntransforming the cellular phone into an integrated mobile platform moving well\nbeyond voice. lxxxiii Such growth will expand both the mobile market and in turn\nthe mobile gaming space.\n\n•\n\nGaming has already become a major player in the mobile space competing with\nother popular data applications. Last year marked the first time consumers spent\nmore downloading games than ringtones, a significant milestone considering the\npopularity of ringtones worldwide.lxxxiv\n\n•\n\nThe expansion of the gaming industry in emerging and new regions is also\nexpected to drive the growth of the mobile gaming sector.lxxxv\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 49\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe penetration of next generation game enabled devices with internet access\ncapabilities and enhanced graphics will facilitate the growth of wireless gaming.\n•\n\nThe number of game enabled devices is expected to grow rapidly from about 40%\nof the 2 billion devices available worldwide today to about 97% of all mobile\ndevices sold in 2008.lxxxvi There were 600 million mobile devices sold last year\nalone compared to 300 million consoles sold in the 25-year history of the\nvideogame industry.lxxxvii\n\n•\n\nThe increasing sophistication of new handsets will make for a more\nenjoyable and immersive gaming experience, thereby expanding\nwireless gaming. Currently, most mobile games are simple and are\nsimilar to games developed for consoles a decade ago because the\ngraphics capabilities of handsets are still relatively limited. However,\nnext generation devices are now being designed and marketed to\nhighlight their gaming features like the Samsung SGH-B450.lxxxviii\n\n•\n\nIn addition to mobile phones, portable gaming consoles like the\nNintendo DS (Dual Screen) and Sony PSP will increasingly\nbecome an important part of the mobile gaming space.\n\n' - m & m\nExhibit 4-5:\nSamsung SGH-B450\n\nThe expansion of the game space will be driven in a large part by mobile gaming.\n•\n\nA huge latent demand exists for mobile gaming with only 5 % of people who own\na phone ever downloading a game and 50% actually ever playing a game.lxxxix\nSuch percentages suggest a huge untapped market segment that is very\nencouraging to the future of mobile gaming given the number of subscribers and\nhandsets available worldwide.\n\n•\n\nEvidence of the how the game space will be driven by mobile gaming occurred\nrecently when for the first time more games were played on mobile devices than\non console games in 2006 x c In terms of revenues, of course, console gaming is far\ngreater, but the importance of this event in mobile gaming cannot be\nunderestimated given that the gaming industry is largely driven by console\ngaming. More games being played on mobile devices represents a shift in what\nfactors will drive the expansion of the game space in years to come.\n\n•\n\nThe significant difference in the mobile gaming market, as oppose to the personal\ncomputer and console sectors, is that the 'would be gamer' already owns and\ncarries the platform on which they can play the game. Mobile devices also tend to\nbe more intimate devices to their users, always available and always on x c i As\nnewer, more advanced technologies are deployed, market analysts expect\ntraditional sectors like the personal computer to lose ground to mobile\nplatforms xcii\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 50\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nThe availability and range of mobile gaming content will increase in the coming\nyears.\n•\n\nThe industry is now moving away from preloaded games to models where games\nare required to be downloaded over the Internet from carriers and third party\nproviders. Such a move should enable more third party mobile game providers\nand distributors to enter the market space, increasing both the availability and\nrange of mobile gaming content. Moreover, it will allow organizations to directly\nmarket mobile games to end users.\n\n•\n\nAn examination of more mature markets suggests that gaming will move beyond\ncasual gaming leading to further growth in the industry. Japan represents the\ncurrent benchmark where many users are playing more than just casual games on\ntheir mobile devices.xciii An exceptionally large number of games are aimed at\nwhat would be considered console and hard core gamers, making the mobile\nphone in Japan as much a games platform as any console.xciv\n\n•\n\nSome gaming experts suggest that multiplayer games are the next big thing in\nmobile gaming as they attempt to recreate virtual worlds for mobile devices,\nwhile other analysts suggest that the next big breakout game would be a mobile\ngame that leverages the power of mobile networks and devices integrating\nfeatures like voice and GPS into the game xcv While industry leaders have\ndifferent views, all are searching for the mobile game that will drive the mobile\nplatform similar to how the Halo, Madden Football and Zelda franchises drove\nsales of the Xbox, Play Station 2 and Nintendo gaming consoles respectively.xcvi\nSuch a game would prove invaluable to expanding the mobile gaming market.\n\n•\n\nThe skills required for a successful mobile game programmer are not\ninsurmountable and include knowledge of Java and J2ME, BREW, Symbian OS,\nOpenGL ES, and/or Mophun. While a skilled programmer would currently be\nrequired to develop a mobile game using one of the aforementioned programs, the\nintroduction of middleware or game modification software in the coming years\nshould enable a broader group to create compelling content for mobile games.\n\nThe Rise of Virtual\n\nWorlds\n\nVirtual worlds will provide the greatest opportunities to support terrorist operations,\nparticularly in the areas of communication, coordination, recruitment andfundraising\nactivities.§§§§ As virtual worlds expand, terrorist opportunities to exploit them will also\nincrease.\n\n§§§§ For a more in depth look at the various ways terrorist organizations can exploit the game space see an\nearlier paper produced in this series \"Exploitation and Function of Games: An Interactive Influence\nMedium.\" SAIC. September, 2006.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 51\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n•\n\nVirtual worlds will become a powerful medium in nascent markets mirroring\nadoption and consumption patterns in more mature markets. As virtual worlds\nexpand, they will increasingly play an important host to a range of ordinary\nhuman affairs in which participants may communicate, coordinate, socialize,\ntrain, learn, simulate, experiment, build, proselytize and even barter virtual\ngoods.xcvii\n\nThe emergence of virtual worlds has significant consequences because events\nwithin the virtual space at times cannot be isolated from the real world, leading some to\nsuggest that the line between the \"virtual\" and \"real\" world is blurring, even becoming\nnon-existent. This phenomenon can best be seen in a virtual world's social interactions,\nexperimental learning and value of virtual goods and services.\n•\n\nSocial interactions occurring in virtual worlds are not simulations of human\ninteractions, rather they are human interactions merely extended in a new\nforum.\nVirtual worlds are places people identify with and where real and\nlasting bonds form, for many becoming an important source of material and\nemotional well being. Avatars become a representation of ones identify and\nimmersion into the virtual world increases the identity that one feels to the virtual\nself. This connection with the virtual world invokes many of the same\npsychological triggers as in the real worldxcviii. For instance, reciprocity and liking\nextensively come into play in relationship formation xcix and the process of\ndeveloping ones avatar seems to invoke exactly the same risk and reward\nstructures in the brain that are invoked by personal development in the real\nworld.c As virtual worlds become more immersive and expand into newer\nmarkets, the number of gamers who identify with and form relationships within\nthese spaces will expand.\n\n•\n\nThe expansion of virtual worlds will provide a space for experimental learning to\ndevelop knowledge or hone a particular skill set with practical applicability in the\nreal world. For instance, becoming an effective leader of a guild amounts to a\n\"total-immersion\" course in leadership - guild leaders are required to be adept at\nmany skills to include \"attracting, evaluating and recruiting new members;\ncreating apprenticeship programs; orchestrating group strategy; and adjudicating\ndisputes.\"ci Absent the virtual surroundings, these skills are prerequisites to\nmanaging and leading any organization.cii\n\n•\n\nVirtual goods, services and currencies have real world value exceeding US$100\nmillion globally. Trades occur in games among players, between players and the\npreset game vendors, and on third party sites like E-Bay, IGE and numerous other\nsites. Current estimates indicate that a large demand for intangible goods exists\nwithin the digital world valued in the range of US$1 - $2 billion making the value\nof virtual goods quite real. For instance, a World of Warcraft (WOW) gold piece is\n\nEdward Castronova originally makes this point in regards to communication occurring the virtual\nspace, however, it is appropriate to extend his argument to all forms of social interaction that occur within\nvirtual worlds.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 52\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nvalued at .46 cents to the US Dollar, meaning a WOW gold piece is traded at\nhigher rates to the US Dollar then real world currencies like the Algerian Dinar,\nIraqi Dinar, Egyptian Pound, Syrian Pound, Pakistani Rupee, Indonesian Rupiahs,\nand Chinese Yuan Renminbi.^®\nVirtual World*\nDark Age of Camelot\nWorld of Warcraft (US)\nWorld of Warcraft (EU)\nSecond Life\nAuto Assault\nEverquest\nDungeons and Dragons\nEverquest II\nFinal Fantasy XI\nStar Wars Galaxies\n\nVirtual World *\n\nUS Dollars\n0.71\n0.46\n0.033\n0.014\n0.013\n0.000237\n0.00015\n0.000148\n0.0000269\n0.00000104\n\nSyrian\nPounds\n\nBritish\nPounds\n0.362\n0.235\n0.0168\n0.00711\n0.00663\n0.000121\n0.0000765\n0.0000755\n0.0000137\n0.00000053\n\nIraqi Dinars\n\nDark Age of Camelot\n37.625\nWorld of Warcraft (US)\n24.377\nWorld of Warcraft (EU)\n1.749\nSecond Life\n0.739\nAuto Assault\n0.689\nEverquest\n0.0126\nDungeons and Dragons\n0.00795\nEverquest II\n0.00784\nFinal Fantasy XI\n0.00143\nStar Wars Galaxies\n0.0000551\nExhibit 4-6: Exchange Rate between Leading\n\nEuro\n0.546\n0.354\n0.0254\n0.0107\n0.0100\n0.000182\n0.000115\n0.000114\n0.0000207\n0.0000008\n\nEgyptian\nPounds\n\nAlgerian\nDinars\n50.802\n32.914\n2.361\n0.998\n0.930\n0.017\n0.0107\n0.0106\n0.00192\n0.0000744\n\nPakistani\nRupees\n\n937.058\n4.048\n43.257\n607.108\n2.622\n28.0255\n43.553\n0.188\n2.0105\n18.411\n0.0795\n0.8499\n17.157\n0.0741\n0.7920\n0.313\n0.00135\n0.0144\n0.198\n0.00086\n0.00914\n0.195\n0.00084\n0.00902\n0.0355\n0.000153\n0.00164\n0.00137\n0.000006\n0.0000634\nVirtual Currencies and Real World\n\nIndonesian\nRupiahs\n6,416.55\n4,157.20\n298.23\n126.07\n117.49\n2.14\n1.36\n1.34\n0.24\n0.01\nChinese\nYuan\nRenminbi\n5.543\n3.591\n0.258\n0.109\n0.101\n0.00185\n0.00117\n0.00116\n0.00021\n0.00000812\nCurrencies^^\n\nVirtual worlds are expanding at exponential rates rivaling the growth of email\nfifteen years ago.

Projections indicate rapid growth in virtual worlds during the\ncoming years with more than 10 million online game players in the U.S.\n(approximately the size of New York City) and 30 million gamers worldwide\n(approximately the size of Shanghai, Bombay and Karachi combined).cv The\nbiggest market for virtual worlds remains Asia closely followed by the United\nStates; however, it is only a matter of time before other markets become more\nactive in online gaming.\n\n•\n\nThe expansion of virtual worlds and the growth rate of its populations lead some\nto suggest that virtual worlds may soon become the primary venue for all online\nactivity.cvi The immersive, persistent and interactive characteristics of virtual\nworlds would enable communication, socialization, and coordination in more\neffective ways then other mediums.\n\nThe Explosion\n\nof User Generated\n\nContent\n\nUser generated content will emerge as a driving force in the gaming space. It will\nbe enabled by the increased availability of software products and programming\nfeatures, lowering the barrier of entry for users to alter, modify and create games.\n•\n\nThe growing availability of middleware or modification programs enable\nindividuals to modify content (partial conversion) or create an entirely new game\n(a total conversion). Popular middleware products include 3D world building\npackages such as Genesis 3D, Quake, Unreal, and Half-Life; multiplayer\nadventure games like Aurora Toolkit; and systems for handling massively\nmultiplayer games like BigWorld, Butterfly.net, and Terazona. These middleware\nproducts have been used to create successful games like Counterstrike (Half-Life)\nand America's Army (Unreal); more dubious games have also been created such\nas Ethnic Cleansing (Genesis 3D), Under Ash and Under Siege (Genesis 3D) and\nSpecial Force (Genesis 3D).\n\n•\n\nThird party software products are available and can be purchased for a marginal\ncost, allowing users to create a fully-customizable and easy to design game.\nPreloaded design packages allow a user to click and select from a multitude of\ngaming scenarios to design their own game. Many of these types of packages are\nsimulation packages designed to train users on given subjects. One such package\noffered by Mosbe enables a user to create a simulation to provide a platform\nstrategy development, experimentation, and rehearsal. The package includes\npreloaded military, civilian, and environmental settings in Iraq, Syria, and the\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 54\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nKorean Peninsula, as well as hundreds of vehicles (air and ground combat, as well\nas civilian) and weapons for even more accurate and realistic simulations.§§§§§\n•\n\nAn emerging trend within content generation is using 3D video game graphics\ntechnology to create animated films known as Machinima. Combining aspects of\nfilm making, animation and game design, Machinima allows users to create their\nown film complete with sets, props, special effects, plots and virtual actors at a\nminimal cost. Software products also allow users to capture game video to\nproduce and edit in game events. One of the more popular political Machinima\npieces is French Democracy, a depiction of the 2005 French riots from the\nMuslim perspective.\n\n•\n\nHigh costs associated with developing games ($20-30 million per major title)\nhave led many smaller publishers on a path to leverage user generated content,\nharnessing the users' creativity as a resource to 'populate' the virtual space.\nOpening scripting options allows users to script events ranging from object\ncontrol, to avatar behavior, to mini-games and other complex programs making\nimagination the only limitation of what a resident can create in the virtual space.\nThis provides a unique opportunity for organizations to promote given agendas.\n\n§§§§§ F o r m o r e i n f o r m a t i o n o n M O S B E , see T S J O n l i n e \" A Toolkit f o r the P e o p l e \"\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 55\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\ni 4 A Ji 4 4\n\nSecond Life Case Study: Content Generation as a Driving Force\n\n•\n\nSecond Lifers content creation engine and LSL feature allows residents to create virtually\nanything, protected by very real intellectual property rights. These tools and subsequent\nintellectual property protections have spurred the growth of a goods and services industry\nincluding entrepreneurs (e.g. real estate moguls), artisans (e.g. architects and fashion\ndesigners) and professional services (e.g. notary public), stimulating an economy\ngenerating nearly $5 million in trade between residents every month. The Second Lifers\ncontent creation engine and LSL features also enable residents to be creative and have fun\nwith other residents. One of the more notable examples of unique content is the\nabductions of residents by aliens whereby abductees receive a T-shirt proclaiming \"I was\nabducted by Aliens.\"\n\n•\n\nSecond Life enjoys 90,000 hours of use per day, with approximately 25% of that time\nspent creating. That equates to 11 user/years per day, which would require a 4,100member content development team costing $40 million per year. In a given week, 5,000\ndistinct residents wrote original scripts (15%), representing 2.5 million lines of source\ncode.\n\n•\n\nSecond Life allows residents to promulgate any Uniform Resource Locator (URL) audio\nor video stream to local communities in Second Life. Second Life also permits users to\nexport XML data from the game to external web sites. Together, this functionality lets\nusers stream \"real\" events into the virtual world and \"virtual\" events into the real word.\n\nAdvances\n\nin Digital\n\nRendering\n\nAdvances in digital rendering are forthcoming with improvements in Graphics\nProcessing Units (GPUs) and rendering algorithms that will enable game designers to\ncreate more life like images and experiences, further increasing the immersion of\nusers.\n•\n\nExisting GPUs are extremely powerful in terms of computing power enabling\ngame designers to render life like images in games. Currently, low end GPUs\nsurpass high end CPUs by at least two to five times in a wide variety of\ncomputing tasks. GPUs peak throughput power also is growing by a factor of two\n\nSecond Life (abbreviated to SL) is an Internet-based virtual world which came to international\nattention via mainstream news media in late 2006 and early 2007. Developed by Linden Lab, a\ndownloadable client program enables users to interact with each other through motional avatars, providing\nan advanced level of a social network service combined with general aspects of a metaverse. While SL is\nsometimes referred to as a game, in general it does not have points, scores, winners or losers, levels, an\nend-strategy, or most of the other characteristics of games. Users, often called \"residents\", can visit this\nvirtual world almost as if it were a real place. They explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in\nindividual and group activities, and buy items (virtual property) and services from one another. As they\nspend more time in the world, they learn new skills and mature socially, learning the culture and manners\nof a virtual environment.

One\nsuch method, parallax occlusion mapping, enables graphic game designers to\nsimulate the illusion of depth on uneven surfaces without increasing the geometric\ncomplexity of rendered objects.®® Such innovation will allow games to create\n3D virtual environments mimicking real world environments.®®\n\nAdvances\n\nin the Science of Haptics\n\nAdvances in haptics (the study of touch and the cutaneous senses) are expected to\ngrow in the coming years providing sensory feedback and furthering the level of\nimmersion in games.\n•\n\nHaptic devices allow users to experience a sensation of touch and physical\nproperties when they interact with virtual materials. They exert force in response\nto a user's action, at the point of action. They enable active 'two-way' interaction\nwith virtual objects, where action and perception are brought together.cix Haptic\ndevices have been making inroads in gaming for sometime, but recent and future\n\ntttttt por more information on digital rendering techniques, see Practical Parallax Occlusion Mapping with\nApproximate Soft Shadows for Detailed Surface Rendering Natalya Tatarchuk ATI Research.

Nintendogs is a popular game that elicits\nemotion through its advanced voice and touch recognition software, helping to\ncreate a strong emotional bond with the virtual pets. Users must talk and touch the\ndog to elicit a response from the virtual pet. Game designer Hideki Konno states,\n\"It is one thing to type in a name and it is an entirely different emotional response\nto call and see the puppy turn its head and run over to greet you.\" cx Nintendogs\nhas been an international phenomenon selling more than 4 million units\nworldwide. Also, the Wii, Nintendo's newest gaming console, offers advanced\ninteraction though wireless remotes where users must use the remote like they\nwould use the item in the game. For instance, tennis requires the user to swing at\nthe ball using different swings and techniques. The introduction of the Wii has\ntaken interactive gaming to a whole other level of immersion.\n\n•\n\nFuture devices employing haptics are not far off with some being marketed in the\nnear term. One device by Novint Technologies, expected to debut later this year,\nallows the user to feel weight, shape, texture, dimension, dynamics, 3-D motion,\nand force effects. §§§§§§ Another product lets users interact physically with virtual\nobjects. For instance, by using a sensor-equipped glove and a force-reflecting\nexoskeleton, you could literally feel the shape, texture and weight of an onscreen\n3-D object.\nSuch devices are used now for virtual modeling, medicine and\nthe military, but as costs decrease, haptic interfaces could become more widely\navailable in the gaming space increasing immersion tenfold.\n\nExhibit 4-8: Haptic Devices by Immersion 3D\n§§§§§§ p o r m o r e information on Haptic devices by Novint, see their webpage at http://www .novint.com/\nFor more information on Haptic devices being developed by Immersion 3D, see their website at\nhttp : //www.immersion.com\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 58\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nChapter Addendum\nEmerging trends in the gaming space will be used to the advantage of groups\ncommitted to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals. They will be an enabler of a\nmore mature and expanded gaming space, creating a powerful medium analogous to\nthe internet for terrorist organizations to reach and target core audiences.\n•\n\nEmerging trends will drive growth in the gaming space across age, gender and\ncultural boundaries. Spread of existing technologies like broadband Internet\naccess and the advent of new technologies like next generation wireless networks\nand mobile devices will mean greater access to individuals residing in burgeoning\nmarkets.\n\n•\n\nChanges within the gaming space will continue at a rapid pace. While marked\ndifferences will exist particularly with access methods, newer markets are\nexpected to mirror the experience of more mature markets in terms of growth and\nusage patterns. Gaming will become a powerful medium playing an increasingly\nimportant role in a range of ordinary human affairs, particularly in virtual worlds,\nproviding an extension and a virtual component to supplement their operations.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 59\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 60\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nFocus Areas\nThis section identifies and discusses three areas for focusing counterterrorism\nefforts in the game space: in-game counterpropaganda, new game development, and\nintelligence collection.\n•\n\nThese three areas are most effectively pursued concurrently and holistically,\nwith operations in one area supporting operations in the other two, and with all\noperations feeding into analysis of the counterterrorist threat in the game\nspace, as illustrated below.\nCompete fo r Players with\nNew Games\n\nCollecting InGame\nIntelligence\n\nExhibit 5-1: Holistic Approach to Game Involvement\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 61\n\nCounter InGame\nPropaganda\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCountering In-Game\n\nPropaganda\n\nCountering extremist propaganda in the game space can be achieved in part by\nbeing an active game player. Establishing an in-game presence allows for virtual\ninterfacing, information exchanges, and developing influential relationships with both\nadversaries and allies. In-game interaction also can help shape real-life attitudes and\nperceptions.\n•\n\nEstablishing an in-game presence would enable identification of influential\nplayers, their guilds and other common interest groups. These relationships can\nbe exploited to facilitate \"viral\" message spread or in-game dialogue for\ncounterpropaganda purposes.\n\n•\n\nEstablishing an in-game presence also would enable identification of important\npropaganda efforts in the game space. Identification of propaganda allows for\nworking with the game producer to eliminate harmful or misleading information\nfrom the game space and/or for developing a counterpropaganda campaign.\n\n•\n\nEstablishing an in-game presence would aid the determination of optimal\nmessage placement areas — cued by where propaganda is surfacing and how it\nis spreading in-game. For example, in some games there are large bulletin\nboards or other communication areas that are exploited.\n\n•\n\nIn-game assets might form partnerships with \"celebrity\" avatars or popular game\ndesign companies for in-game public service announcements such as \"antiviolence\" campaigns. Generating in-game public service announcements backed\nby game producers, NGOs or other public interest groups is a popular\nphenomenon in some game spaces. For example, the Omidyar Network currently\nsponsors the Camp Darfur campaign, which is run on the Better World Island in\nSecond Life. The purpose of the campaign is to educate players on the crisis in\nSudan.cxi\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 62\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCompeting for Players with New\n\nGames\n\nAnother opportunity to focus IC counterterrorism efforts in the game space is new\ngame or modified game development to compete with extremist groups operating in the\ngame space. Working with commercial partners, students, and others in the game\nspace to develop a competitive game and attract the target audience would aid this\ne ort\nff •\n\nMarket research could provide valuable insights into the interests and habits of\ngame players from a particular target audience. Using focus groups throughout\nthe game production cycle also would help to identify the strengths and\nweaknesses of the story, graphics, and game play.\n\n•\n\nPartnerships with gaming industry leaders and a gaming advisory board might\nhelp the IC direct the development of new games with the best chance for\nsuccess. An advisory board might be comprised of experts from a variety of\nacademic disciplines and commercial industries, including public diplomacy,\nSilicon Valley, Venture capitalism, NGOs, international relations, game\ndevelopment, and celebrity game players.\n\n•\n\nStudent groups also couldfuel new game development. Many colleges and\nuniversities now host programs that focus on game design and production. Assetsponsored scholarships and incentives could be used to encourage students to\ndevelop appropriately-themed game designs. For example, each year the\nUniversity of Southern California (USC) sponsors a video game design contest in\nwhich students compete for a $25,000 grand prize. Students are asked to develop\ngames that could be used for public diplomacy purposes.\n\n•\n\nFinally, it is important to highlight that modifying games (or \"modding\") is a\npopular and cost effective way to produce new games or additional \"chapters \"\nto existing games. Many companies allow the codes of their popular titles to\nsurface on the Internet because modding tends to increase a game's shelf life and\nprovides the original game producer time to build a new quality product. An\norganization can mod a game in-house or encourage a member of the modding\ncommunity to make mods independently.\n\nExhibit 5-3: USC promotes diplomacy via new media including games.™\"\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 63\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nCollecting In-Game\n\nIntelligence\n\nGaming is an increasingly popular activity among many demographic groups\nacross North America, Europe, the Middle East and parts of Africa. cxiv Monitoring of ingame activities and related game-devoted areas of the Internet such as blogs,\nchatrooms, and virtual periodicals, provide significant intelligence collection\nopportunities.\n\nExhibit 5-4: Joystick Gaming Blog cxv\n\nFor example, game space provides potential opportunities to identify terrorist\nfinancial operations by monitoring the flow of money in virtual economies and\ndetermining who is involved in the buying and selling of virtual goods andfundraising.\n•\n\nFrom virtual real estate to virtual clothing for avatars, the sale of virtual goods is\nincreasing rapidly. Virtual monies hold real-world value and can be cashed-out\ninto hard currency. Game players trade virtual products in exchange for real\nmoney via portals such as E-bay and Second Life. Intangible goods in digital\nworlds are estimated to be worth $1 billion to $2 billion.cxvi\n\n•\n\nFurthermore, players sharing account information may be utilizing game space to\ntransfer funds from one person to another - under the auspices of a single player's\naccount. The ability to upload in-world currency makes this plausible. Studying\nthe activities and profiles of users selling virtual goods might help determine\nwhether or not funds are being funneled by or to terrorists.\n\n•\n\n\"Gold farming,\" or game-supported sweatshops in which workers play games to\ndevelop the strongest avatars which can then be sold on websites such as E-bay\nfor large profits, could be used for terrorist fundraising purposes. Where gold\nfarming is taking place and who is benefiting from the sale of avatars or goods\nalso represents a useful area of investigation.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 64\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nExhibit 5-5: A virtual store in Second Lifeaxvu\n\nGame-devoted areas of the Internet such as blogs, chatrooms, online\nperiodicals, wikis, andforums can provide unique insights into hot trends for key\ntarget audiences of interest to the IC.\n•\n\nIntelligence collection of this sort would provide such basic information as which\nnew titles are most popular and best suited for message dissemination.\n\n•\n\nOf particular interest would be commentary on games with political messages\nsuch as Kuma/Wars.\n\nChapter Addendum\nSAIC's strategic communications division provides unique capabilities to support\ncounterpropaganda, new game development, and intelligence collection in the game\nspace.\n1. Tracking terrorist gaming trends using the SAIC Prototype\nSAIC's automated processing capability of terrorist Web site content provides a unique\nopportunity to track terrorist online games. Data processing and reporting might address:\n(1) current popular online games and associated discourse, (2) social networks emerging\nin these communities, (3) gaming and community sites that are increasing or decreasing\nin popularity, (4) the emergence of new terrorist gaming sites in cyberspace or current\ngame sites that have been modified, (5) the online spread of terrorist gaming activity, and\n(6) Web sites that host material about terrorist games.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 65\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\n2. Organizing a Gaming Advisory Board\nThrough the Cyber-Influence Conference Series, SAIC has expanded the IC's network of\ngaming experts with varied academic and technical backgrounds. SAIC might help\nleverage this network to develop a Gaming Advisory Board.\n3. Assist in the development of an IOC institutional knowledge gaming database\nHaving conducted extensive research on terrorist gaming efforts, SAIC analysts might\nhelp facilitate IOC's development of an institutional knowledge gaming database to\nsupport operations and analysis.\n4. Organize efforts to construct a game\nSAIC might also help organize a game construction effort out-of-house. This effort could\nleverage the network of gaming professionals established via the Cyber-Influence\nConference Series as well as SAIC's experience in game development.\n\nFOUO - Not for Public Distribution\nPage 66\n\n\fGames: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities\n\nINDEX\n#\n3-D, 37, 59\n3G, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50\n4G, 44, 48, 49, 50\n5G, 48\n\nA\nAC Nielson, 6\nActive, 17, 20\nAddiction, 24\nAddiction recovery programs, 24\nAfrica, 6, 35, 46, 65\nAge of Empires, 41\nAl-Jazeera, 48\nAmerican Cancer Society, 12\nArabic, 8, 9\nARG, 33\nArmy, 10, 13, 55\nAsia, 12, 35, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 55\nAssault on Iran, 9\nAssault on Iran, Pt. 3, 9\n\nB\nBattlefield, 13\nBattlefield 2, 13\nBigWorld, 13, 55\nBombay, 6, 55\nBourdieu, Pierre 16\nBREW, 52\nBroadband, 45, 46, 47\nBT Openzone, 50\nButterfly.net, 13, 55\n\nD\nDar al-Fikr, 9\nDarfur, 22\nDARWARS, 11\nDelta Force 2, 21\nDinar, 54\nDollar, 54\nDoom, 13, 28\n\nE\nE-Bay, 53\nEducation, 71\nEgypt, 47\nEMEA, 46, 47, 48, 49\nEmerging trends, 26, 44, 60\nEntertainment, 45, 71\nEthnic Cleansing, 13, 21, 22, 55\nEurope, 6, 35, 48, 50, 65\nEverQuest, 29, 54\nEverQuest II, 54\nExchange rate, 54\nExpansion, 54\nexploit, 52\n\nF\n\nC\nCasual, 71\nChain of Command, 21\nChina, 49\nCivilization, 41\nCollege students, 13\nCombat, 11\nCommand & Conquer, 41\nCommander Bahman, 9\nCommunication, 27\nConditioning, 21\nCounter, 47\nCounterstrike, 10, 13, 28, 47, 55\nCPU, 58\nCulture, 45, 71\ncybercafés.

NSA is actively assisting executive protection and event security, and\nproviding support to policymakers.\nBackground (U)\n(U) As host, Canada has set this G8 Summit's theme: Recovery and New Begifi,ning. On the G8\nagenda are international development (health, food security, natural resources trade, and climate\nchange); and peace and security (nonproliferation and Afghanistan-Pakistan).\n(U) The G20 Summit is to focus on implementing the September 2009 Pittsbiirgh G20 Summit';\nframework for strong and balanced world economic growth. Also on the agemeta are internationa\nfinancial institutions' reform and re-financing, financial sector regulatory refoi•ijm, and countering\ntrade protectionism.\n\nSummit Venues (U)\n(U) The G8 Summit will be held on 25 and 26 June in Huntsville, in Ontario's Muskoka Region,\n(The G8 Summit venue is also called Muskoka.) The G20 Summit will be helc on 26 and 27\nJune m Toronto, Ontario - about 140 miles south of Huntsville. A preparatory\nG20 sherpas (aides and personal representatives of the heads of state and government) is set for\n23 and 24 June in Toronto.\nThreat Potential (U)\n(S//REL) The Intelligence Community assesses that there is no specific, credit Le information thai\nal-Qa'ida or other Islamic extremists are targeting the G8 and G20 Summits. A1-Qa'ida and\nassociated groups, however, have expressed interest in targeting Canada in the past, and the\nSummits may provide an attractive target for terrorists seeking to capitalize on the media\ncoverage.\n(S//REL) The Community judges, however, that issue-based extremists pose a more likely threat\nto the Summits. These extremists have conducted acts of vandalism at previouk G8 and G20\nsummits. Similar disruptive activity will probably occur throughout the Summ its, and will be\nmore concentrated during the G20 in Toronto.\nG8 and G20 Summit Participants (U)\n(U) The G8 - the Group of Eight - is both the forum of eight industrialized niitions and the\nannual, meeting of the heads of state or governmenf.of these eight nations: Canaida, France,\nGermany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States. For th< Huntsville G8\nSummit, Canada has invited the leaders of Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi, I igeria, Senegal,\nand South Africa to participate in an Africa outreach session. Also invited are olombia, Haiti,\nand Jamaica.\n\n\f(U) The G20 -- the Group of Twenty - consists of the G8 members plus: Arge antina, Australia,\nBrazil, China, European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South\nKorea, and Turkey. Also invited to attend the Toronto G20 Summit are: Ethiopia, Malawi,\nNetherlands, Nigeria, Spain, and Vietnam, plus the Financial Stability Board, he International\nMonetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developmejnit, the United\nNations and its International Labour Organization, the World Bank Group, and the World Trade\nOrganization. (The next G20 Summit will be held during November 2010 in Sleoul, South\nKorea.)\nIntelligence Community Support Structure (U)\n(S//REL) The Director of National Intelligence Representative (DNIR) in Otta wa is the United\nStates Government (USG) intelligence lead for the G8 and G20 Summits. The DNI's Special\nEvents Intelligence Coordinator (SEIC) will operate a Threat Integration Centi;:ir (TIC) in the\nU.S. Embassy in Ottawa to support him during both events. The TIC began n<ojrmal operations\n22 June, and will operate 0600 to 2100 EDT from 24 through 27 June. The TIC will publish a\ntwice daily Situation Report, respond to Requests for Information and coordinaite the\ndissemination of intelligence and pre-event assessments.\nNSA Support to Event Security (U)\n(S//REL) Relevant SID reporting offices are aware of the Summits and poised to report in a\ntimely matter intelligence related to the events. While NSA will have no physi sal presence in the\nTIC, direct coordination will be through the CTMMC and NSOC. who will fkthier collaborate\nwith the Special U.S. Liaison Office, Ottawa (SUSLOO) staff and provide thr^iat warning\ndirectly to the venues. NSA support planning has been closely coordinated wiiih the Canadian\npartner through SUSLOO.\n(S//SI//REL) NSA support to both events may include, but is not limited to: ex ecutive protection\nU.S. policy goals, situational awareness, threat information, and local security posture. Reporting :\ninstructions have been published by SI 2 in \"SIGINT Reporting in Support of the G8 and G20\nSummits, Canada, June 2010\" (ISS-148-10). A SIGINT collaborative workspace has been\nestablished for the G8 and G20 Summits on Extended Shared Enterprise Corporate Server\n(ESECS). See \"CASE-2010-99: (U//FOUO) G8 and G20 Summits in Canada, B5-27 June.\" A\nWikilnfo page G8-G20 Canada 2010 has been created for the Summits, and ac ditional\ninformation may be found at the SI7 Economics and Global Issues G8/G20 wobsite.\n(S//REL) CTMMC will be the focal point for 24/7 CT operations, employing r ormai procedures\nto ensure timely and effective distribution of threat tippers and lead informatio ri, to coordinate\nCT activities related to any threat situation, and to facilitate foreign release requests.\n(C//REL) SI 1 l's SCC desk will be responsible for coordinating RFIs and responses, while\nNSOC/CRSMM will respond to time critical RFIs after hours. NSOC/CRSMM will also\ncoordinate drafts of the TIC's twice-daily sitreps.\n\n\f(C//REL) NSOC/APSMM will provide reachback to TOPIs and extended ente: prise for policy\nsupport issues using normal call-in procedures and instructions.\n(S//REL) NSOC/SRO will facilitate after-hour requests for release of non-threnit information,\nwhile S12's Partnership Dissemination Cell (PDC) will perform this function during normal duty\nhours.\n(S//REL) NSA's Event lead, S17 Strategic Intelligence Issues, will work extended hours,\napproximately 0600 to 2200 EDT through 27 June to maintain situational awaieness of SIGINT\ncapabilities and facilitate coordination across the SIGINT system and with the IC.\n(S//REL) SUSLOO personnel will be available for call-in by CTMMC, NSOC or SI7 to provide\nlocal support to the TIC for imminent threat situations.\nCustomer Requirements (U)\n(S//REL) There are currently seven limited and six standing Information Needf related to the tw<fc\nsummits.\nFor Further Info (U)\n(U//FOUO) The SI7 Special Events Team can be reached.\n\nNAMIC PAGE\n\n\f",

Using\n\ns lx\n\nprom inent: globally-resonating foreign radicalizers as exemplars, this report focuses on the m eans they use to\n\nreach their intended audience and reveals potential \\ulnerabilities for exploitation. It should b e rea d in conjunction with N S A report 3 R A 50151812 , which identifies \\ulner abilities o f authority.\n(TS SI REL TO U SA , FV E Y ) Information herein is b a sed largely on Sunni extremist communications and includes dissem inated S IG IN T as\nwell as collateral available betw een January 2008 and Septem ber 2012. The SIG IN T information is from primary sources with direct access and is\ngenerally considered reliable. G reater specificity on the SIG IN T sourcing is provided in the text. Included in the appendix are charts on w ays that\naccess has b een affected and counterm easures taken; a com parison o f radicalizers’ access mechanisms: and a matrix that com pares their authority,\nargument, countries where they resonate, and their personal Milnerabilities.\n\n\fBACKGROUND (U)\n(TS SI REL TO USA.. F V E Y ) A p re\\io u s SIG IN T assessm ent report on radicalization indicated that radicalizers ap p ear to b e particularly\nMilnerable in die area o f authority when their private and public behaMors are not consistent. (A) Som e o f the \\nlnerabilities, if exposed, would likely\ncall into question a radicalizers devotion to the jihadist cause, leading to the degradation or loss o f his authority. Exam ples o f some o f these\n\\nlnerabilities include:\n• Viewing sexually explicit material online or using sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls:\n• Using a portion o f the donations they are recehing from the susceptible pool to defray their ow n personal expenses;\n•\n\nCharging an exorbitant amount o f m oney for their speaking fees and being singularly attracted by opportunities to increase their stature; or\n\n• Being know n to b ase their public messaging on questionable sources or using language that is contradictory in nature, lea\\ing them open to\ncredibility challenges.\n(TS SI REL T O U SA , FV E Y ) Issues o f trust and reputation are im portant w hen considering the validity and appeal o f the m essage. It stands\nto reason that exploiting Milnerabilities o f character, credibility, or both, o f the radicalizer and his m essage could b e enhanced by an understanding o f\nthe vehicles he uses to disseminate his m essage to the susceptible pool o f people and w here he is Milnerable in term s o f access.\n\n\f(TS SI REL TO U SA , FV E Y ) Examining how the six radicalizers establish and maintain access with different pools o f people susceptible to\ntheir m essage — and their perceptions o f the difficulties in doing so — suggests that there are Milnerabilities that can b e exploited in term s o f this\naccess, and emerging radicalizers m ay b e Milnerable on this point as well. Focusing on access reveals potential Milnerabilities that could b e even\nm ore effectively exploited when used in combination with Milnerabilities o f character or credibility, or both, o f the m essage in order to shape the\nperception o f the m essenger as well as that o f his followers.\n\n\f(TS SI REL T O U SA , F V E Y /F IS A ) Six globally-resonating, radicalizers are used as exem plars in this assessm ent. The first three listed target\nan English-speaking audience, while the second three target an A rabic-speaking audience.\n\nnam es redacted\n\n(TS SI REL T O U SA , F V E Y /F IS A ) O ne indicator o f the potential effectiveness o f these radicalizers is the extent o f their resonance, i.e., the\nnum ber and locations o f indhiduals w ho resp o n d to a radicalizer’s m essage by contacting him using his publicly-known contact information. A\nsignificant proportion o f the audience associated with the specified English-language radicalizers is located in Pakistan, yet none o f these radicalizers\nap p ear to have any communicants in common. In addition, communications profiles o f these English-language radicalizers reveal that very few o f the\ncontacts n o ted w ere associated with terrorism, suggesting that the target audience includes indhiduals w ho do not yet hold extremist view s but who\nare susceptible to the extremist m essage.\n\n\fname\nredacted\n\n|W ell-know n\n\n|K illin g\n\nof\n\n\n|-D isa g re e s\n\n|c le ric ,\n\n|n o n -M u slim\n\n\n|w ith\n\nAQ o n\n\n|e x tre m ist\n\n|o ccu p iers\n\n|som e\n\nissu es\n\n|fin a n c ie r,\n\n|ju s tif ie d\n\n\n|an d\n\n\n\n|Q a i' da\n\n\n\n|c iv ilia n s )\n\n|su p p o rte r\n\n\n\n|-P rag m atic\n\n\n\n\n|o n\n\n\n|S p rin g \"\n\na l-\n\nis\n\n\n—\n\nname\nredacted\n\n|W ritin g s\n\n|T he\n\n|a p p e ar\n\n|b ro u g h t\n\non\n\nU .S.\nthe\n\n|-D e c e itfu l\n|u se\n\nidentifying\ninformation\nred a cte d\n\nof\n\n| 9 /1 1\n\nattack s\n\n\nIjih a d i\n\n|u p o n\n\ni t s e l f\n\n\n|w e b site s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|c o n tra d ic -\n\n\n\n\n| to ry\n\n\n|sta te m e n ts\n\n|P re a c h e s\n\n\n|c le ric ,\n\n|in to le ra n c e\n\n\nfor\n\n|fo r\n\na ll\n\n|fu n d s\n|-P o te n tia l\nIfo r\n\n4T- —\n\n|W ell-know n\n\n\nIh o s t i l i t y\n\n|n o n -S u n n i\n\n\n|to w ard s\n\n|M u s lim s\n\n\n|n o n -S u n n i\n\n\n\n|-C h a rg e s\n|e x o rb ita n t\n\nidentifying\ninformation\nred a cte d\n\n|sp eak in g\nIfees\n|-A ttra c te d\n|to\n\nfame\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\"Arab\n\n4T- —\n\n\n|M uslim s\n\n----------------------------\n\n|ta rg e tin g\n\nIn u m ero u s\n\n|fam o u s\n\nname\nredacted\n\n| (e.g.\n\n\n—\n\nname\nredacted\n\nidentifying\ninformation\nred a cte d\n\nIW ell-know n\n\n|T he\n\n|m edia\n\nU.S.\n\n4T- —\n\n\n|-G lam o ro u s\n\nIp erp etrated\n\n\n|lif e s ty le\n\n|c e le b rity\n\n|th e\n\n\n\n|a tta c k s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|-P o ssib ly\n\n\n\n\n|m isd ire c ts\n\nj.--------------------------\n\n—\n\n9 /1 1\n\n|-M isin te r­\n\nidentifying\ninformation\nred a cte d\n\nj.---------------------------- - + - -----------------------\n\np r e t s\n|Q u r’an\n\n—\n\n|d o n a tio n s\n-------------------------( .\n\n\f(TS SI REL TO U SA .

Our customers and\nstakeholders can rely on us to provide timely, high quality products and services, because we never stop\ninnovating and improving, and we never give up!\n(U) The Environment\n(U//FOUO) For decades, Signals Intelligence has sustained deep and persistent access to all manner of\nadversaries to inform and guide the actions and decisions of Presidents, military commanders, policy\nmakers and clandestine service officers. As the world has changed, and global interdependence and the\nadvent of the information age have transformed the nature of our target space, we have adapted in\ninnovative and creative ways that have led some to describe the current day as “the golden age of\nSIGINT.”\n(U//FOUO) That reputation was hard-won, but will only endure if we keep sight of the dynamic and\nincreasingly market driven forces that continue to shape the SIGINT battle space. We must proactively\nposition ourselves to dominate that environment across discovery, access, exploitation, analysis,\ncollaboration and in the products and services we provide. The SIGINT system and our interaction\ntherein must be as agile and dynamic as the information space we confront.\n(U//FOUO) The mission space for SIGINT in the years ahead will continue to grow at a rapid pace\namidst a dramatically new set of challenges:\n(U//FOUO) The interpretation and guidelines for applying our authorities, and in some cases the\nauthorities themselves, have not kept pace with the complexity of the technology and target\nenvironments, or the operational expectations levied on NSA’s mission.\n• (U) Digital information created since 2006 grew tenfold, reaching 1.8 exabytes in 2011, a trend\nprojected to continue; ubiquitous computing is fundamentally changing how people interact as\nindividuals become untethered from information sources and their communications tools; and the\ntraces individuals leave when they interact with the global network will define the capacity to locate,\ncharacterize and understand entities1.\n\n(U) Center for the Study of Intelligence (2010) Where Tomorrow Will Take Us: The New Environment for Intelligence. August 2010\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\n\n• (U) Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming U.S. advantages\nin conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneously and exceedingly hard to\ntrace. Such attacks may not cause the mass casualties of a nuclear strike, but they could paralyze U.S.\nsociety all the same2.\n• (U) The international system – as constructed following the Second World War – will be almost\nunrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers, a globalizing economy, an historic\ntransfer of relative wealth and economic power from West to East, and the growing influence of\nnon-state actors3.\n(U) Expectations\n(U//FOUO) The power of information, its short shelf life in the information age and the speed at which\nit moves will set the conditions for how NSA interacts with customers. Transactional, passive or linear\nrelationships will be replaced by embedded, deeply interactive engagements. Existing investments in\ncyber security will by necessity expand across the enterprise to meet the demand and speed of action\nrequired to thwart our adversaries. To remain a value for the warfighter our information must be\nimmediately available at the lowest classification level. The nation will continue to depend upon NSA to\nbe the lead for the application of the science of cryptography, sustaining access and understanding of\ndata even as encryption becomes automatic, transparent and prolific. Products and services from NSA\nwill evolve into forms and across boundaries that mirror the networked and agile manner in which\npeople interact in the information age, and we will share information, responsibly and securely, with\nexternal partners and customers.\n(U//FOUO) For SIGINT to be optimally effective, legal, policy, and process authorities must be as\nadaptive and dynamic as the technological and operational advances we seek to exploit. Nevertheless,\nthe culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary\nauthorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue\nlegal authorities and a policy framework mapped more fully to the information age.\n(U//FOUO) To sustain current mission relevance and to meet the challenges, the Signals Intelligence\nDirectorate must undertake a profound and revolutionary shift from the mission approach which has\nserved us so well in the decades preceding the onset of the information age to a SIGINT system that is\nas agile and dynamic as the information space we confront. The environment demands it, the capability\nof the SIGINT system can achieve it and the work force has the creativity and the skill base to make it\npossible.\n(U//FOUO) What follow are the five challenge goals the SIGINT leadership has established to close gaps\nbetween the environment and expectations over the next five years.\n\n2(U)\n\nLynn, William J.

What is its purpose?\n2) Who are the intended users of the tool?\n3) What are the different views?\n4) Where do you get your data?\n5) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?\n6) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?\n7) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?\n8) What is the technical architecture for the tool?\n9) What are some upcoming features/enhancements?\n10) How are new features or views requested and prioritized?\n11) Why are record counts different from other tools like ASDF and What's On Cover?\n12) Why is the tool NOFORN? Is there a releasable version?\n13) How do you compile your record counts for each country?\n\nNote: This document is a work-in-progress and will be updatedfrequently as additional questions and\nguidance are provided.\n1) (U) What is BOUNDLESSINFORMANT. What is its purpose?\n\n(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT is a GAO prototype tool for a self-documenting SIGINT system. The purpose of the\ntool is to fundamentally shift the manner in which GAO describes its collection posture. BOUNDLESSINFORMANT\nprovides the ability to dynamically describe GAO's collection capabilities (through metadata record counts) with no human\nintervention and graphically display the information in a map view, bar chart, or simple table. Prior to\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT, the method for understanding the collection capabilities of GAO's assets involved ad hoc\nsurveying of repositories, sites, developers, and/or programs and offices. By extracting information from every DNI and DNR\nmetadata record, the tool is able to create a near real-time snapshot of GAO's collection capability at any given moment. The\ntool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collection against that\ncountry. The tool also allows users to view high level metrics by organization and then drill down to a more actionable level down to the program and cover term.\nSample Use Cases\n• (U//FOUO) How many records are collected for an organizational unit (e.g. FORNSAT)?\n• (U//FOUO) How many records (and what type) are collected against a particular country?\n• (U//FOUO) Are there any visible trends for the collection?\n• (U//FOUO) What assets collect against a specific country? What type of collection?\n• (U//FOUO) What is the field of view for a specific site? What countriees does it collect against? What type of\ncollection?\n\n2) (U) Who are the intended users of the tool?\n•\n•\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) Mission and collection managers seeking to understand output characteristics of a site based on what is being\ningested into downstream repositories.\n(U//FOUO) Strategic Managers seeking to understand top level metrics at the organization/office level or seeking to\nanswer data calls on NSA collection capability.\n(U//FOUO) Analysts looking for additional sites to task for coverage of a particular technology within a specific country.\n\n3) What are the different views?\n\n(U//FOUO) Map View - The Map View is designed to allow users to view overall DNI, DNR, or aggregated collection\nposture of the agency or a site. Clicking on a country will show the collection posture (record counts, type of collection, and\ncontributing SIGADs or sites) against that particular country in addition to providing a graphical display of record count\n\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - FAQ\nUNCLAS SIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 1 of 3\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - Frequently Asked Questions\n\n09-06-2012\n\ntrends. In order to bin the records into a country, a normalized phone number (DNR) or an administrative region atom (DNI)\nmust be populated within the record. Clicking on a site (within the Site Specific view) will show the viewshed for that site —\nwhat countries the site collects against.\n(U//FOUO) Org View - The Organization View is designed to allow users to view the metadata record counts by\norganizational structure (i.e. GAO - SSO - RAM-A - SPINNERET) all the way down to the cover term. Since it's not\nnecessary to have a normalized number or administrative region populated, the numbers in the Org View will be higher than\nthe numbers in the Map View.\n(U//FOUO) Similarity View - The Similarity View is currently a placeholder view for an upcoming feature that will\ngraphically display sites that are similar in nature. This can be used to identify areas for a de-duplication effort or to inform\nanalysts of additional SIGADs to task for queries (similar to Amazon's \"if you like this item, you'll also like these\" feature),\n\n4) (U) Where do you get your data?\n\n(U//FOUO) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT extracts metadata records from GM-PLACE post-FALLOUT (DNI ingest processor)\nand post-TUSKATTIRE (DNR ingest processor). The records are enriched with organization information (e.g. SSO,\nFORNSAT) and cover term. Every valid DNI and DNR metadata record is aggregated to provide a count at the appropriate\nlevel. See the different views question above for additional information.\n\n5) (U) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) The tool resides on GM-PLACE which is only accredited up to TS//SI//NOFORN. Therefore, the tool\ndoes not contain ECI or FISA data.\n(U//FOUO) The Map View only shows counts for records with a valid normalized number (DNR) or administrative\nregion atom (DNI).\n(U//FOUO) Only metadata records that are sent back to NSA-W through FASCIA or FALLOUT are counted.\nTherefore, programs with a distributed data distribution system (e.g. MUSCULAR and Terrestrial RF) are not\ncurrently counted.\n(U//FOUO) Only SIGINT records are currently counted. There are no ELINT or other \"INT\" records included.\n\n6) (U) Why are you showing metadata record counts versus content?\n(U//FOUO)\n\n7) (U) Do you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?\n\n(U//FOUO) The tool currently makes no distinction between sustained collect and survey collect. This feature is on the\nroadmap.\n\n8) What is the technical architecture for the tool?\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nClick here for a graphical view of the tool's architecture\n(U//FOUO) DNI metadata (ASDF), DNR metadata (FASCIA) delivered to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)\non GM-PLACE\n(U//FOUO) Use Java MapReduce job to transform/filter and enrich FASCIA/ASDF data with business logic to\nassign organization rules to data\n(U//FOUO) Bulk import of DNI/DNR data (serialized Google Protobuf objects) into Cloudbase (enabled by custom\naggregators)\n(U//FOUO) Use Java web app (hosted via Tomcat) on MachineShop (formerly TurkeyTower) to query Cloudbase\n(U//FOUO) GUI triggers queries to CloudBase - GXT (ExtGWT)\n\n9) What are some upcoming features/enhancements?\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - FAQ\nUNCLAS SIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 2 of 3\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - Frequently Asked Questions\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n09-06-2012\n\n(U//FOUO) Add technology type (e.g. JUGGERNAUT, LOPER) to provide additional granularity in the numbers\n(U//FOUO) Add additional details to the Differential view\n(U//FOUO) Refine the Site Specific view\n(U//FOUO) Include CASN information\n(U//FOUO) Add ability to export data behind any view (pddg,sigad,sysid,casn,tech,count)\n(U//FOUO) Add in selected (vs. unselected) data indicators\n(U//FOUO) Include filter for sustained versus survey collection\n\n10) How are new features or views requested and prioritized?\n\n(U//FOUO) The team uses Flawmill to accept user requests for additional functionality or enhancements. Users are also\nallowed to vote on which functionality or enhancements are most important to them (as well as add comments). The\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT team will periodically review all requests and triage according to level of effort (Easy, Medium,\nHard) and mission impact (High, Medium, Low). The team will review the queue with the project champion and government\nsteering committee to be added onto the BOUNDLESSINFORMANT roadmap.\n\n11) Why are record counts different from other tools like ASDF and What's On Cover?\n\n(U//FOUO) There are a number of reasons why record counts may vary.

CHAPTER 5\nPROCEDURE 5. ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE\nC5.1. PART 1; ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR\nINTELLIGENCE PURPOSES\nC5.1.1. Applicability. This part of Procedure 5 implements the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1979 (reference (b)), and applies to electronic\nsurveillance, as defined in that Act, conducted by DoD intelligence components within\nthe United States to collect \"foreign intelligence information,\" as defined in that Act.\nC5.1.2. General Rules\nC5.1.2.1. Electronic Surveillance Pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act. A DoD intelligence component may conduct electronic surveillance\nwithin the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes only\npursuant to an order issued by a judge of the court appointed pursuant to the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (reference (b)), or pursuant to a certification of\nthe Attorney General issued under the authority of Section 102(a) of the Act.\nC5.1.2.2. Authority to Request Electronic Surveillance. Authority to approve\nthe submission of applications or requests for electronic surveillance under the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (reference (b)) shall be limited to the Secretary\nof Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Secretary or Under Secretary of a\nMilitary Department, and the Director of the National Security Agency. Applications\nfor court orders will be made through the Attorney General after prior clearance by the\nGeneral Counsel, DoD. Requests for Attorney General certification shall be made only\nafter prior clearance by the General Counsel, DoD.\nC5.1.2.3. Electronic Surveillance In Emergency Situations\nC5.1.2.3.1. ADoD intelligence component may conduct electronic\nsurveillance within the United States in emergency situations under an approval from the\nAttorney General in accordance with Section 105(e) of reference (b).\nC5.1.2.3.2. The head of a DoD intelligence component may request that\nthe DoD General Counsel seek such authority directly from the Attorney General in an\nemergency, if it is not feasible to submit such request through an official designated in\nsubparagraph C5.1.2.2., above, provided the appropriate official concerned shall be\nadvised of such requests as soon as possible thereafter.\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nC5.2. PART 2: ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OUTSIDE THE UNTIED STATES FOR\nINTELLIGENCE PURPOSES\nC5.2.1. Applicability. This part of Procedure 5 applies to electronic surveillance,\nas defined in the Definitions Section, for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence\npurposes directed against United States persons who are outside the United States, and\nwho, under the circumstances, have a reasonable expectation of privacy. It is intended\nto be applied in conjunction with the regulation of electronic surveillance \"within the\nUnited States\" under Part 1 and the regulation of \"signals intelligence activities\" under\nPart 3 so that the intentional interception for foreign intelligence and\ncounterintelligence purposes of all wire or radio communications of persons within the\nUnited States and against United States persons abroad where such persons enjoy a\nreasonable expectation of privacy is covered by one of the three parts. In addition, this\npart governs the use of electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance devices for foreign\nintelligence and counterintelligence purposes against a United States person abroad in\ncircumstances where such person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. This part\ndoes not apply to the electronic surveillance of communications of other than United\nStates persons abroad or the interception of the communications of United States\npersons abroad that do not constitute electronic surveillance.\nC5.2.2. Explanation of Undefined Terms\nC5.2.2.1. Electronic surveillance is \"directed against a United States person\"\nwhen the surveillance is intentionally targeted against or designed to intercept the\ncommunications of that person. Electronic surveillance directed against persons who\nare not United States persons that results in the incidental acquisition of the\ncommunications of a United States person does not thereby become electronic\nsurveillance directed against a United States person.\nC5.2.2.2. Electronic surveillance is \"outside the United States\" if the person\nagainst whom the electronic surveillance is directed is physically outside the United\nStates, regardless of the location at which surveillance is conducted. For example, the\ninterception of communications that originate and terminate outside the United States\ncan be conducted from within the United States and still fall under this part rather than\nPart 1.\nC5.2.3. Procedures. Except as provided in paragraph C5.2.5., below, DoD\nintelligence components may conduct electronic surveillance against a United States\nperson who is outside the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence\npurposes only if the surveillance is approved by the Attorney General. Requests for\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\napproval will be forwarded to the Attorney General by an official designated in\nsubparagraph C5.2.5.1., below. Each request shall include:\nC5.2.3.1. An identification or description of the target.\nC5.2.3.2. Astatement of the facts supporting a finding that:\nC5.2.3.2.1. There is probable cause to believe the target of the electronic\nsurveillance is one of the following:\nC5.2.3.2.1.1. Aperson who, for or on behalf of a foreign power is\nengaged in clandestine intelligence activities (including covert activities intended to\naffect the political or governmental process), sabotage, or international terrorist\nactivities, or activities in preparation for international terrorist activities; or who\nconspires with, or knowingly aids and abets aperson engaging in such activities;\npower;\n\nC5.2.3.2.1.2. Aperson who is an officer or employee of a foreign\n\nC5.2.3.2.1.3. Aperson unlawfully acting for, or pursuant to the\ndirection of, a foreign power. The mere fact that a person's activities may benefit or\nfurther the aims of a foreign power is not enough to bring that person under this\nparagraph, absent evidence that the person is taking direction from, or acting in knowing\nconcert with, the foreign power;\nC5.2.3.2.1.4. Acorporation or other entity that is owned or\ncontrolled directly or indirectly by a foreign power; or\nC5.2.3.2.1.5. Aperson in contact with, or acting in collaboration with,\nan intelligence or security service of a foreign power for the purpose of providing\naccess to information or material classified by the United States to which such person\nhas access.\nC5.2.3.2.2. The electronic surveillance is necessary to obtain significant\nforeign intelligence or counterintelligence.\nC5.2.3.2.3. The significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence\nexpected to be obtained from the electronic surveillance could not reasonably be\nobtained by other less intrusive collection techniques.\nC5.2.3.3. Adescription of the significant foreign intelligence or\ncounterintelligence expected to be obtained from the electronic surveillance.\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nC5.2.3.4. Adescription of the means by which the electronic surveillance will\nbe effected.\nC5.2.3.5. If physical trespass is required to effect the surveillance, a\nstatement of facts supporting a finding that the means involve the least amount of\nintrusion that will accomplish the objective.\nC5.2.3.6. Astatement of period of time, not to exceed 90 days, for which the\nelectronic surveillance is required.\nC5.2.3.7. Adescription of the expected dissemination of the product of the\nsurveillance, including a description of the procedures that will govern the retention and\ndissemination of communications of or concerning United States persons other than\nthose targeted, acquired incidental to such surveillance.\nC5.2.4. Electronic Surveillance in Emergency Situations. Notwithstanding\nparagraph C5.2.3., above, a DoD intelligence component may conduct surveillance\ndirected at a United States person who is outside the United States in emergency\nsituations under the following limitations:\nC5.2.4.1. Officials designated in paragraph C5.2.5., below, may authorize\nelectronic surveillance directed at a United States person outside the United States in\nemergency situations, when securing the prior approval of the Attorney General is not\npractical because:\nC5.2.4.1.1. The time required would cause failure or delay in obtaining\nsignificant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence and such failure or delay would\nresult in substantial harm to the national security;\nC5.2.4.1.2. Aperson's life or physical safety is reasonably believed to be\nin immediate danger; or\nC5.2.4.1.3. The physical security of a defense installation or Government\nproperty is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger.\nC5,2.4.2. Except for actions taken under subparagraph C5.2.4.1.2., above, any\nofficial authorizing such emergency surveillance shall find that one of the criteria\ncontained in subparagraph C5.2.3.2.1., above, is met. Such officials shall notify the\nDoD General Counsel promptly of any such surveillance, the reason for authorizing such\nsurveillance on an emergency basis, and the expected results.\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nC5.2.4.3. The Attorney General shall be notified by the General Counsel,\nDoD, as soon as possible of the surveillance, the circumstances surrounding its\nauthorization, and the results thereof, and such other information as may be required to\nauthorize continuation of such surveillance.\nC5.2.4.4. Electronic surveillance authorized pursuant to this section may not\ncontinue longer than the time required for a decision by the Attorney General and in no\nevent longer than 72 hours.\nC5.2.5. Officials Authorized to Request and Approve Electronic Surveillance\nOutside the United States\nC5.2.5.1. The following officials may request approval of electronic\nsurveillance outside the United States under paragraph C5.2.3., above, and approve\nemergency surveillance under paragraph C5.2.4., above:\nDepartments.\n\nC5.2.5.1.1.

Any general or flag officer at the overseas location in\nquestion, having responsibility for either the subject of the surveillance, or\nresponsibility for the protection of the persons, installations, or property that is\nendangered, or\nAgency.\n\nC5.2.5.2.2. The Deputy Director for Operations, National Security\n\nC5.3. PART 3: SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES\nC5.3.1. Applicability and Scope\nC5.3.1.1. This procedure governs the conduct by the United States Signals\nIntelligence System of signals intelligence activities that involve the collection,\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nretention, and dissemination of foreign communications and military tactical\ncommunications. Such activities may incidentally involve the collection of information\nconcerning United States persons without their consent, or may involve communications\noriginated or intended for receipt in the United States, without the consent of a party\nthereto.\nC5.3.1.2. This part of Procedure 5 shall be supplemented by a classified\nAnnex promulgated by the Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security\nService, which shall also be approved by the Attorney General. That regulation shall\nprovide that signals intelligence activities that constitute electronic surveillance, as\ndefined in Parts 1, and 2 of this procedure, will be authorized in accordance with those\nparts. Any information collected incidentally about United States persons shall be\nsubjected to minimization procedures approved by the Attorney General.\nC5.3.2. Explanation of Undefined Terms\nC5.3.2.1. Communications concerning a United States person are those in\nwhich the United States person is identified in the communication. AUnited States\nperson is identified when the person's name, unique title, address or other personal\nidentifier is revealed in the communication in the context of activities conducted by that\nperson or activities conducted by others and related to that person. A reference to a\nproduct by brand name or manufacturer's name or the use of a naine in a descriptive\nsense, as, for example, \"Monroe Doctrine,\" is not an identification of a United States\nperson.\nC5.3.2.2. Interception means the acquisition by the United States Signals\nIntelligence system through electronic means of a nonpublic communication to which it\nis not an intended party, and the processing of the contents of that communication into\nan intelligible form, but not including the display of signals on visual display devices\nintended to permit the examination of the technical characteristics of the signals\nwithout reference to the information content carried by the signals.\nC5.3.2.3. Military tactical communications means United States and allied\nmilitary exercise communications within the United States and abroad necessary for the\nproduction of simulated foreign intelligence and counterintelligence or to permit an\nanalysis of communications security.\nC5.3.2.4.

Aperson known to be currently in the United States will be\ntreated as a United States person unless the nature of the person's communications or\nother available information concerning the person gives rise to a reasonable belief that\nsuch person is not a United States citizen or permanent resident alien.\nC5.3.2.4.2. Aperson known to be currently outside the United States, or\nwhose location is not known, will not be treated as a United States person unless the\nnature of the person's communications or other available information concerning the\nperson give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States citizen or\npermanent resident alien.\nC5.3.2.4.3. Aperson known to be an alien admitted for permanent\nresidence may be assumed to have lost status as a United States person if the person\nleaves the United States and it is known that the person is not in compliance with the\nadministrative formalities provided by law that enable such persons to reenter the United\nStates without regard to the provisions of law that would otherwise restrict an alien's\nentry into the United States. The failure to follow the statutory procedures provides a\nreasonable basis to conclude that such alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining\nstatus as a permanent resident alien.\nC5.3.2.4.4. An unincorporated association whose headquarters are located\noutside the United States maybe presumed not to be a United States person unless the\ncollecting agency has information indicating that a substantial number of members are\ncitizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\nC5.3.2.5. United States Signals Intelligence System means the unified\norganization for signals intelligence activities under the direction of the Director,\nNational Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service, comprised of the National\nSecurity Agency, the Central Security Service, the components of the Military Services\nauthorized to conduct signals intelligence and such other entities (other than the Federal\nBureau of Investigation) as are authorized by the National Security Council or the\nSecretary of Defense to conduct signals intelligence. FBI activities are governed by\nprocedures promulgated by the Attorney General.\nC5.3.3. Procedures\nC5.3.3.1. Foreign Communications. The United States Signals Intelligence\nSystem may collect, process, retain, and disseminate foreign communications that are\nalso communications of or concerning United States persons, but only in accordance\nwith the classified annex to this procedure.\n30\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nC5.3.3.2. Military Tactical Communications. The United States Signals\nIntelligence System may collect, process, retain, and disseminate military tactical\ncommunications that are also communications of or concerning United States persons\nbut only in accordance with the classified annex to this procedure.\nC5.3.3.2.1. Collection. Collection efforts will be conducted in the same\nmanner as in the case of signals intelligence for foreign intelligence purposes and must\nbe designed in such a manner as to avoid to the extent feasible the intercept of\ncommunications not related to military exercises.\nC5.3.3.2.2. Retention and Processing. Military tactical communications\nmaybe retained and processed without deletion of references to United States persons\nwho are participants in, or are otherwise mentioned in exercise-related communications,\nprovided that the communications of United States persons not participating in the\nexercise that are inadvertently intercepted during the exercise shall be destroyed as\nsoon as feasible.\nC5.3.3.2.3. Dissemination. Dissemination of military tactical\ncommunications and exercise reports or information files derived from such\ncommunications shall be limited to those authorities and persons participating in or\nconducting reviews and critiques of such exercise.\nC5.4. PART4: TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE COUNTERMEASURES\nC5.4.1. Applicability and Scope.

Concealed monitoring in the United States for foreign intelligence and\ncounterintelligence purposes where the subject of such monitoring has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes\nshall be treated as \"electronic surveillance within the United States\" under Part 1 of\nProcedure 5, and processed pursuant to that procedure.\nC6.1.3. Concealed monitoring for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence\npurposes of a United States person abroad where the subject of such monitoring has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement\npurposes shall be treated as \"electronic surveillance outside the United States\" under\nPart 2 of Procedure 5, and processed pursuant to that procedure.\nC6.1.4. Concealed monitoring for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence\npurposes when the monitoring is a signals intelligence activity shall be conducted\npursuant to Part 3 of Procedure 5.\nC6.2. EXPLANATION OF UNDEFINED TERMS\nC6.2.1. Concealed monitoring means targeting by electronic, optical, or\nmechanical devices a particular person or a group of persons without their consent in a\nsurreptitious and continuous manner. Monitoring is surreptitious when it is targeted in\na manner designed to keep the subject of the monitoring unaware of it. Monitoring is\ncontinuous if it is conducted without interruption for a substantial period of time.\nC6.2.2. Monitoring is within the United States if the monitoring device, or the\ntarget of the monitoring, is located within the United States.\n38\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nC6.2.3. Whether concealed monitoring is to occur where the subject has a_\nreasonable expectation of privacy is a determination that depends upon the\ncircumstances of a particular case, and shall be made only after consultation with the\nlegal office responsible for advising the DoD intelligence component concerned.\nReasonable expectation of privacy is the extent to which a reasonable person in the\nparticular circumstances involved is entitled to believe his or her actions are not\nsubject to monitoring by electronic, optical, or mechanical devices. For example, there\nare ordinarily reasonable expectations of privacy in work spaces if a person's actions\nand papers are not subject to ready observation by others under normal working\nconditions. Conversely, a person walking out of his or her residence into a public\nstreet ordinarily would not have a reasonable expectation that he or she is not being\nobserved or even photographed; however, such a person ordinarily would have an\nexpectation of privacy within his or her residence.\nC6.3. PROCEDURES\nC6.3.1. Limitations On Use of Concealed Monitoring. Use of concealed\nmonitoring under circumstances when the subject of such monitoring has no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy is subject to the following limitations:\nC6.3.1.1. Within the United States, a DoD intelligence component may\nconduct concealed monitoring only on an installation or facility owned or leased by the\nDepartment of Defense or otherwise in the course of an investigation conducted\npursuant to the Agreement Between the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General\n(reference (g)).\nC6.3.1.2. Outside the United States, such monitoring maybe conducted on\ninstallations and facilities owned or leased by the Department of Defense. Monitoring\noutside such facilities shall be conducted after coordination with appropriate host\ncountry officials, if such coordination is required by the governing Status of Forces\nAgreement, and with the Central Intelligence Agency.\nC6.3.2. Required Determination. Concealed monitoring conducted under\nparagraph C6.3.1., requires approval by an official designated in paragraph C6.3.3.,\nbelow, based on a determination that such monitoring is necessary to the conduct of\nassigned foreign intelligence or counterintelligence functions, and does not constitute\nelectronic surveillance under Parts 1 or 2 of Procedure 5.\nC6.3.3. Officials Authorized to Approve Concealed Monitoring. Officials\nauthorized to approve concealed monitoring under this procedure include the Deputy\n39\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nUnder Secretary of Defense (Policy); the Director, Defense Intelligence Agency; the\nDirector, National Security Agency; the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence,\nDepartment of Army; the Director, Naval Intelligence; the Director of Intelligence, U.S.\nMarine Corps; the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, U.S. Air Force; the\nCommanding General, Army Intelligence and Security Command; the Director, Naval\nInvestigative Service; and the Commanding Officer, Air Force Office of Special\nInvestigations,\n\n40\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\fDoD 5240.1-R, December 1982\n\nCI.

They govern the conduct by the United States\nSignals Intelligence System of signals intelligence activities that involve the collection, retention\nand dissemination of communications originated or intended for receipt in the United States, and\nsignals intelligence activities that are directed intentionally against the communications of a\nUnited States person who is outside the United States. These procedures also govern the\ncollection, retention and dissemination of information concerning United States persons that is\ncollecte^^h^nite^tate^ignals Intelligence System including such activities undertaken\nby\nprocedures do not apply to signals intelligence\nactivities that are not required under Executive Order 12333 to be conducted pursuant to\nprocedures approved by the Attorney General. Further, these procedures do not apply to signals\nintelligence activities directed against the radio communications of air and sea vessels for the\npurpose of collecting foreign intelligence regarding international narcotics trafficking or in\nsupport of federal law enforcement efforts to interdict such trafficking. Such signals intelligence\nactivities are subject to a separate classified annex approved earlier by the Attorney General (See\nAnnex J to United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18). Except for matters expressly\nauthorized herein, the limitations contained in Department of Defense Regulation 5240.1-R also\napply to the United States Signals Intelligence System.

The term \"foreign communication\" means a\ncommunication that involves a sender or an intended recipient who is outside the United States\nor that is entirely among foreign powers or between a foreign power and officials of a foreign\npower. Electronic surveillance within the United States targeted against communications\nentirely among foreign powers or between a foreign power and officials of a foreign power will\nbe coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including surveillances targeted against\ntelephone communications or telecommunications that serve residential or non-official premises\nof a foreign power or foreign officials within the United States. This coordination is intended to\nsatisfy the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation intelligence\nrequirements, preclude duplication of effort, and ensure that appropriate minimization practices\nare developed and applied.\n(U) Foreign Intelligence. The term \"foreign intelligence\" includes both positive foreign\nintelligence and counterintelligence.\n-ffi4Jllicit Communication. The term \"illicit communication\" means a communication\ntransmitted in violation of the Communications Act of 1934 and regulations thereunder or of\ninternational agreements which because of its explicit content, message characteristics, or\nAnnex to Policy 1-23\nDated: 11 March 2004\n\nA-2\nS K R I i r U M I M ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ H\n\n\fSECRET//COMINTA\nmethod of transmission is reasonably believed to be a communication to or from an agent or\nagents of foreign powers, whether or not United States persons.\n(U) Interception. The term \"interception\" means the acquisition by the United States\nSignals Intelligence System through electronic means of a nonpublic communication to which it\nis not an intended party, and the processing of the contents of that communication into an\nintelligence form but not including the display of signals on visual display devices intended to\npermit the examination of the technical characteristics of the signal without reference to the\ninformation content carried by the signal.\n—^-International Commercial Communications. The term \"international commercial\nCommunications\" means foreign communications transmitted internationally in whole or in part\nby one or mor^ommercia^^foreigi^overnment communications carriers, and includes, but is\nnot limited to,\nInternational commercial communications may be\nwire, telephone or radio communications transmitted by high frequency, microwave, satellite or\nother mode of transmission.\n(C) National Diplomatic Communications. The term \"national diplomatic\ncommunications\" includes all communications, regardless of the mode of transmission,\ntransmitted by or to a foreign power and to which no United States person is a communicant.\nThe official communications of an international organization composed of foreign governments\nare included in the meaning of this term, provided, however that the communications of official\nrepresentatives of the United States are not included.\n(C) Selection. The term \"selection,\" as applied to manual and mechanical processing\nactivities, means the intentional insertion of a name, cable, TELEX, or other address and answer\nback or other alpha-numeric device into a computer scan dictionary or manual scan guide for the\npurpose of identifying messages of interest and isolating them for further processing.\n-4G4-Selection Term. The term \"selection term\" means the composite of individual terms\nused to effect or defeat selection of particular communications for the purpose of interception. It\ncomprises the entire term or series of terms so used, but not any segregable term contained\nherein. It applies to both mechanical and manual processing.\n(U) Technical Data Base. The term \"technical data base\" means information retained\nfor cryptanalytic or traffic analytic purposes.\n\n(C) United States Person. For purposes of intentionally collecting the communications\nof a particular person, the term \"United States person,\" in addition to the meaning in the\nAppendix to DoD Regulation 5240.1-R, includes any alien known to be presently in the United\nStates; any unincorporated association of such aliens or American citizens; the United States\nAnnex to Policy 1-23\nDated: 11 March 2004\nA-3\n\nS EC RET//COMI NT/]\n\n\fSECRET//COMINTA\noperations, office, branch, or representative of a corporation incorporated abroad; any\ncorporation or corporate subsidiary incorporated in the United States; and any U.S. flag nongovernmental aircraft or vessel: Provided, however, that the term \"U.S. person\" shall not include\n(i) non-permanent resident aliens and entities in the United States that have diplomatic immunity\nas determined in accordance with Subsection 4.B; or (ii) a foreign power or powers as defined in\nSection 101 (a)(l)-(3) of FISA.\nSec. 3: Policy (U)\n(U) The Director, National Security Agency, is assigned responsibility for signals\nintelligence collection and processing activities and communications security activities. In order\nto assure that these activities are conducted in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order\n12333, the Director, or his designee, will issue appropriate directives and instructions\nimplementing these procedures and governing the conduct of the United States Signals\nIntelligence System and the activities of communications security entities.\n~(C)-ft is the policy of the United States Signals Intelligence System to collect, retain, and\ndisseminate foreign communications and military tactical communications. It is recognized,\nhowever, that the United States Signals Intelligence System may incidentally intercept nonforeign communications, including those of or concerning United States persons, in the course of\nauthorized collection of foreign communications. The United States Signals Intelligence System\nmakes every reasonable effort, through surveys and technical means, to reduce to the maximum\nextent possible the number of such incidental intercepts acquired in the conduct of its operations.\nInformation derived from these incidentally intercepted non-foreign communications may be\ndisseminated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the information is foreign intelligence\nor counterintelligence or indicates a threat to the physical safety of any person. Dissemination\nof such information is also governed by these procedures and applicable minimization\nprocedures approved in accordance with FISA. Specific communications sent from or intended\nfor receipt by the United States persons are not intercepted deliberately by the United States\nSignals Intelligence System unless specific authorization for such interception has been obtained\nin accordance with these procedures.\n(0//SI) The President has authorized, and the Attorney General hereby specifically\napproves, interception by the United States Signals Intelligence System of:\n* National Diplomatic Communications;\n* International Commercial Communications;\n* Illicit Communications;\n* United States and Allied Military exercise communications;\n\nSECRETY/COMINT/^\n\nA-4\n\nAnnex to Policy 1-23\nDated: 11 March 2004\n\n\fSECRETV/COMINTVJ\n* Signals collected during the search of the signals environment for foreign communications\nthat may be developed into sources of signals intelligence;\n* Signals collected during the monitoring of foreign electronic surveillance activities directed\nat United States communications consistent with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of\n1978;and\n* Signals collected during the testing and training of personnel in the use of signals\nintelligence collection equipment in the United States consistent with the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act of 1978.\nSec. 4: Procedures (U)\nA.-fë^Signals Intelligence: Communications of, or concerning.

Retention (U)\n• (0//0I) Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons that are\nintercepted by the United States Signals Intelligence System may be retained in their original\nform or as transcribed only:\n(a) if processed so as to eliminate any reference to United States persons;\n(b) if necessary to the maintenance of technical data bases. Retention for this\npurpose is permitted for a period sufficient to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access\nto data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or future\nintelligent requirement. Sufficient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. In the\ncontext of a cryptanalytic effort, sufficient duration may consist of a period of time during which\nencrypted material is subject to, or of use in, cryptanalysis. In the case of international\ncommercial communications that may contain the identity of United States persons and that are\nnot enciphered or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufficient duration is one year\nunless the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, determines in writing that\nretention for a longer period is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or\ncounterintelligence requirements; or\n(c) if dissemination of such communications without elimination of references to\nsuch United States persons would be permitted under section 4.A.4 below.\n3. Processing (U)\n(a) (S//SI) Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons must\nbe processed in accordance with the following limitations:\n(1) When a selection term is intended to intercept a communication on the\nbasis of encipherment or some other aspect of the content of the communication, rather than the\nidentity of a communicant or the fact that the communication mentions a particular individual:\n(a) No selection term may be used that is based on content and that is\nreasonably likely to result in the interception of communications to or from a United States\nperson, or which has in the past resulted in the interception of a significant number of such\nA-8\n\nAnnex to Policy 1-23\nDated: 11 March 2004\n\n\fSECRET//COMINTA\ncommunications, unless there is reasonable cause to believe that foreign intelligence or\ncounterintelligence will be obtained by use of such a selection term.\n(b) All such selection terms shall be reviewed annually by the Deputy\nDirector for Operations, National Security Agency, or his designee to determine whether there is\nreasonable cause to believe that foreign intelligence or counterintelligence will be obtained by\nthe use of these selection terms. The review of such selection terms shall include an examination\nof whether such selection terms have in the past resulted in the acquisition of foreign\nintelligence.\n(c) Selection terms based on content that have resulted or that are\nreasonably likely to result in the interception of communications to or from a United States\nperson shall be designed to defeat, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, the\ninterception of such communications not containing foreign intelligence.\n(2) Foreign communications collected by the United States Signals\nIntelligence System or other authorized entities may be forwarded to the National Security\nAgency as intercepted. This applies to forwarding to intermediate processing facilities, including\nthose of authorized collaborating centers pursuant to written agreements, provided such\nforwarding does not result in the production by the United States Signals Intelligence System of\ninformation in violation of these procedures.\n(b) (S//SI) Except as provided in (b)(1), radio communications that pass over\nchannels with a terminal within the United States must be processed by use of selection terms,\nunless these communications occur over channels used exclusively by a foreign power.\n(1) Radio communications that pass over channels with a terminal in the\nUnited States may be processed without the use of selection terms only when necessary to\ndetermine whether a channel contains communications of foreign intelligence interest which the\nNational Security Agency wishes to collect. Processing under this section may not exceed two\nhours without approval of the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, and\nshall in any event be limited to the minimum amount of time necessary to determine the nature\nof communications on the channel and the amount of such communications that include foreign\nintelligence. Once it is determined that the channel contains a sufficient amount of\ncommunications of foreign intelligence interest to warrant collection and exploitation to produce\nforeign intelligence, additional processing of the channel must utilize selection terms.\n4. Dissemination (U)\n• (C//0I) Dissemination of signals intelligence derived from foreign communications of, or\nconcerning, United States persons is governed by Procedure 4 of DoD Regulation 5240.1-R.\nDissemination of signals intelligence shall be limited to authorized signals intelligence\nconsumers in accordance with requirements and tasking established pursuant to Executive Order\n12333.

REPORTING PARAMETERS\na. The DoD Components shall report the following matters to the ATSD(IO) in\naccordance with References (a) and (d).\n(1) Questionable Intelligence Activity. An intelligence activity, as defined\nin E.O. 12333 (Reference (f)), that may be unlawful or contrary to executive order,\nPresidential directive, or applicable DoD policy governing that activity.\n(2) Significant or Highly Sensitive Matters. A development or\ncircumstance involving an intelligence activity or intelligence personnel that could\nimpugn the reputation or integrity of the DoD Intelligence Community or otherwise call\ninto question the propriety of an intelligence activity. Such matters might be manifested\nin or by an activity:\n(a) Involving congressional inquiries or investigations.\n(b) That may result in adverse media coverage.\n(c) That may impact on foreign relations or foreign partners.\n(d) Related to the unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected\ninformation, such as information identifying a sensitive source and method. Reporting\nunder this paragraph does not include reporting of routine security violations.\n(3) Crimes Reported to the Attorney General. Any intelligence activity\nthat has been or will be reported to the Attorney General, or that must be reported to the\nAttorney General as required by law or other directive, including crimes reported to the\nAttorney General as required by Department of Justice-DoD Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (Reference (g)).\nb. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, the ATSD(IO) will be notified prior to\nbriefings of any congressional committee or member of Congress concerning intelligence\nmatters identified in paragraphs l.a.(l), l.a.(2), and l.a.(3) of this attachment. Should\nextenuating circumstances, in fact, delay notification to the ATSD(IO) until after the\nbriefing, then the ATSD(IO) will be notified of the outcome of the briefing at the first\nopportunity thereafter.\n\nAttachment 1\n\n\fDTM 08-052, June 17, 2009\nc. The DoD Component assigned to or conducting intelligence activities may\nestablish internal organizational reporting responsibilities pursuant to that Component's\ninternal policies and regulations.\n2. SUBMISSION OF REPORTS. DoD Components assigned to conduct intelligence\nand counterintelligence activities shall submit reports to the ATSD(IO) in accordance\nwith the following guidance.\na. Report questionable intelligence activities of a serious nature and all significant\nor highly sensitive matters immediately. Such reports may be made by any secure means.\nOral reports should be documented with a written report as soon as possible thereafter.\nb. Report questionable intelligence activities not of a serious nature quarterly.\nReporting periods shall be based on the calendar year. The first report for each calendar\nyear shall cover January 1 through March 31. Succeeding reports shall follow at 3-month\nintervals. Quarterly reports are due to the ATSD(IO) by the 15th day of the month\nfollowing the end of the quarter. Quarterly reports will describe all questionable\nintelligence activities as well as significant or highly sensitive matters identified during\nthe quarter. Quarterly reports are routinely submitted to the ATSD(IO) through normal\nmodes of routing and transmission (e.g., chain of command, hard or soft copy).\nQuarterly reports are required even if no reportable matters occurred during the reporting\nperiod.\nc. Reporting DoD Components will format all reports as follows:\n(1) Assignment of a Case Number for Each Incident. Except where the\nvolume of incident investigations that have been reported and closed within the same\nreporting quarter makes the assigning of a case number to each case impracticable, a case\nnumber that runs consecutively and identifies the reported incident by reporting agency,\nMilitary Department, or Combatant Command and calendar year shall be assigned to\neach incident. For example: \"DIA 2009 - 04\" would indicate the fourth incident reported\nby DIA in calendar year 2009. Use this number each time the incident is mentioned in\ninitial reports, and in update and close-out reports. A case number will be assigned to all\nreported incidents that, at a minimum, are the subject of an ongoing investigation.\n(2) Information to be Included in Each Report. For each incident reported,\ninclude the following information as it becomes available.\n(a) A narrative describing each incident reported.\n\n\nAttachment 1\n\n\fDTM 08-052, June 17, 2009\n(b) An explanation of why the incident is being reported either as a\npotential violation of law, potentially contrary to executive order or Presidential directive,\nor a potential violation of Reference (b) and/or agency or Military Department procedures\nimplementing Reference (f). Cite the portions of relevant law, order, policy, or\nregulation as it is determined.\n(c) An explanation of why the incident is considered a significant or\nhighly sensitive matter, if so reported.\n(d) An analysis of how or why the incident occurred.\n(e) An assessment of the anticipated impact of the reported incident\non national security or international relations, as well as any mitigation efforts, including\nsuccess and failures of such efforts. If there has been no impact or no impact is\nanticipated, the report should so state.\nincident.\n\n(f) Remedial action taken or planned to prevent recurrence of the\n\n(g) An assessment of any impact the reported incident may have on\ncivil liberties or protected privacy rights.\n(h) A description of actions taken if the incident concerns\ninformation improperly acquired, handled, used, or destroyed.\n(i) Any additional information considered relevant for purposes of\nfolly informing the Secretary and/or Deputy Secretary of Defense, the IOB, and the DNI\nand providing context about the incident.\nd. Each quarterly report should be organized under the major headings of \"New\nIncidents\" and \"Updates on Previously Reported Incidents.\" The latter heading includes\nincidents still under inquiry as well as those resolved and closed during the quarter.\ne. Additionally, each quarterly report will contain a summary of gravity,\nfrequency, trends and patterns of the questionable intelligence activities, and/or\nsignificant or highly sensitive incidents reported during that quarter, to the extent that\nthey can be determined. Otherwise, the summary should be provided, as the information\nbecomes available, in a subsequent quarterly report.\nf. The quarterly report shall include a description of any inspection findings or\nintelligence oversight program developments, such as publication of a revised\nintelligence oversight regulation, that the reporting DoD Component believes is\nsignificant. Neither training reports nor inspection schedules shall be included in the\n\nAttachment 1\n\n\fDTM 08-052, June 17, 2009\nquarterly report to ATSD(IO). DoD Components shall monitor compliance with training\nrequirements and inspection schedules.\ng. Reporting shall not be delayed or postponed pending an investigation,\ncommand inquiry, or legal proceeding.\n3. PROHIBITED USE OF THIS ATTACHMENT. This attachment shall not be used to\nprepare the Annual Intelligence Oversight Report to Congress, which is signed by the\nSecretary of Defense. Instructions for preparing the Annual Intelligence Oversight\nReport to Congress will be issued by the ATSD(IO) in November of each year; the\nAnnual Report will be due to the ATSD(IO) January 31 of each year.\n\n\nAttachment 1\n\n\f",

The authority was granted by the FISC in\nsupport of the Counterterrorism mission to permit NSA to learn more about a terrorist target's communications, even those terrorists potentially\nlocated in the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) Bulk metadata consists of \"unselected\" communications events, and the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs complement NSA's\ntraditional selection-based intelligence collection.\n(TS//SI//NF) As you can probably imagine, bulk internet and telephony metadata, acquired within the United States, contains information to, from, or about\nU.S. persons. Therefore, because there is unminimized U.S. person information included within this type of metadata, there are special rules and\nprocedures we must follow when acquiring, processing, accessing, storing, sharing, and disseminating this information. This metadata is highly sensitive\nwhich is why we have this specialized training.\n(TS//SI//NF) In this course we discuss the metadata we collect, how we collect it, what we are permitted to do with it as well as other special rules and\nprocedures we must follow.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 3 of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nDATE/PREPARER: TAP\n\nTopic\n(TS//SI//NF) Introduction to the BR\nand PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs\nHome\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n3 of 12\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 1030\n\nNEXT FRAME ID: 1040\n\nBACK FRAME ID: 1020\nALT TAG:\nGRAPHIC/AV:\n(TS//SI//NF) Possible cutaway images\nmay include:\n•\n\nimages pertinent to\ntelecommunications and internet\ncommunications, call records,\nemai\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): To get started, let's discuss the individual Bulk Metadata Programs. The BR Program pertains to the acquisition of telephony\nmetadata. The associated FISC Order allows NSA to ask specific U.S.-based telecommunications service providers for their business records. The\nbusiness records, also known as call detail records, contain information about phone calls.\nrogram and associated FISC Order permits the collection of bulk Internet communications metadata.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Under both these FISC orders, NSA is prohibitedfromacquinnacommunications content. Under these Programs, NSA may not listen to\nphone calls, or collect the body or subject of an email\nThe Bulk Metadata authorities permit the|\nabout the communications.\n(TS//SI//NF) In Module 2, we will explore how each type of metadata is obtained and what specific information each order permits NSA to collect.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nDATE/PREPARER: TAP\n\nTopic\n(U) \"Touching\" the data\nHome\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECR ET//SI//N OFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n4 of 12\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 1040\n\nNEXT FRAME ID: 1050\n\nBACK FRAME ID: 1030\nALT TAG:\nGRAPHIC/AV:\n(TS//SI//NF) Possible cutaway images may\ninclude:\nimages pertinent to querying data\n\nimage of query results being\nshared, disseminated, and retained\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): Due to the sensitivity of the data and the desire to protect the privacy of U.S. persons, the FISC imposes restrictions on how\nwe can touch the data. For the purposes of this course, by \"touch\" we mean any activity where there is an opportunity to commit a violation with regards to\nthe Orders governing these authorities. We recognize that it takes a very diverse team of individuals working to see that the data is properly acquired,\nrouted, prepared, stored, then queried, shared and disseminated. From acquisition to dissemination, including management and compliance, if you play a\nrole in enabling this data to be used for its intelligence value, we consider you to be someone who \"touches\" this data.\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA's goal is to provide reasonable assurance that we are complying with the law AND making the most of these authorities to support the\ncounterterrorism mission and protect the United States.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 5 of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nDATE/PREPARER: TAP\n\nTopic\n(TS//SI//NF) Similarities in the BR\nand PR/TT Orders\nHome\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n5 of 12\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 1050\n\nNEXT FRAME ID: 1055\n\nBACK FRAME ID: 1040\nALT TAG:\nGRAPHIC/AV:\n(U) Possible cutaway images may\ninclude:\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nimages that depict the\nsimilarities highlighted in the\nscript\nForeign Powers\nRAS\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): BR and PR/TT are two separate orders issued by the FISC, though the general access, sharing, dissemination, and retention\nrules are the same for the two programs. Those similarities are why the training for both is covered in this course. Additionally, both Orders target the same\ngroups, referred to in the Orders as the Foreign Powers. The Foreign Powers named in the orders are I\n| Both the BR and PR/TT prog\nArticulable Suspicion, or RAS, to gain approval to query the bulk metadata with an identifier.

Details of the differences will be addressed in later modules,\nbut at a basic level, the biggest difference between the two Programs is how the metadata is obtained.|\n\n(TS//SI//NF) The other point where the Bulk Metadata Programs differ is in the area of hop restrictions for contact chaining. This will be described in detail\nin Module 4, but for now it is important to know that according to the Orders the hop restrictions are different for the BR and PR/TT Programs.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 7 of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage S of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nTopic\n(U) The Role of the Bulk\nMetadata Programs\nHome\n\nDATE/PREPARER: SLS\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECR ET//SI//N OFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n8 of 12\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 1070\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA may perform SIGINT functions under various FISA authorities to include:\n•\nNSA FISA\n\nNEXT FRAME ID: 1075\n\nBACK FRAME ID: 1060\nALT TAG:\nGRAPHIC/AV:\n\n•\n\nFBI FISA\n\n•\n\nFAA Section 702\n\n•\n\nFAA Section 704\n\n•\n\nFAA Section 705(b)\n\n(TS//SI//NF) BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs provide analysts with another opportunity to gain unique\ncollection on a target\n(TS//SI//NF) By leveraging various collection authorities, analysts can fill existing knowledge gaps on their\ntarget\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): Now that you have a better understanding of what the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs are, you may be wondering\nwhere these programs fit in the context of the broader set of SIGINT authorities.\n(TS//SI//NF) Recall from OVSC1100, the Overview of Signals Intelligence Authorities, that we learned that in addition to E.O. 12333, NSA may perform\nSIGINT functions under various FISA authorities to include NSA FISA, FBI FISA, FISA Amendments Act (FAA) Section 702, 704, and 705(b). While there\nare specific rules governing when and how these authorities may be applied, each of these authorities has the potential to provide a valuable and unique\ncomplement to our E.O. 12333 collection resources. Similarly, the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs provide analysts with another opportunity to\ngain unique collection on a target. By leveraging as many of these various collection authorities available to them as permitted, analysts can fill existing\nknowledge gaps on their target.\n(TS//SI//NF) One prime example of how an analyst leveraged several of these collection authorities to close crucial knowledge gaps on a target occurred in\nFall 2009, when a CT analyst pieced together information obtained from E.O. 12333, FAA 702, and BR FISA authorities to reveal a terrorist plot on the New\nYork subway system, which was subsequently disrupted by the FBI.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 9 of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nDATE/PREPARER: SLS\n\nTopic\n(U) The Role of the Bulk\nMetadata Programs (cont.)\nHome\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECR ET//SI//N OFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n9 of 12\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 1075\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Similarities between SPCMA and BR & PR/TT\n(TS//SI//NF) Both involve exclusively metadata\nNEXT FRAME ID: 1080\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Both allow for querying of U.S. person identifiers under specific circumstances\n\n(TS//SI/NF) Differences between SPCMA and BR & PR/TT\nBACK FRAME ID: 1070\nALT TAG:\n\nof the metadata\no SPCMA procedures apply to metadata\n\nGRAPHIC/AV:\n\nalready lawfully collected under E.O.\n12333, NSA FISA, FBI FISA, FAA 702, 704,\nand 705(b) authorities\no BR and PR/TT programs authorize the\nacquisition of unselected, bulk metadata\n\n(TS//SI//NF) To query the\nmetadata:\no SPCMA requires valid and\ndocumented foreign intelligence\npurpose\no BR and PR/TT require RASapproved identifier for a limited\ntarget set\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): It is also important to understand what the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata programs are not. You may have heard of SPCMA the Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis.

What SPCMA and the BR and PR/TT programs have in common, then, is that they both exclusively involve metadata, and allow for queries of\nidentifiers belonging to U.S. persons.\n(TS//SI//NF) Unlike SPCMA, however, the BR and PR/TT Programs authorize the acquisition of unselected, bulk metadata. Because of the sensitivity of\nthis metadata, it may only be queried with identifiers for which RAS exists to believe that the identifier is directly associated with the Foreign Powers\nspecified in the Court Order granted by the FISC. You will learn much more about the RAS standard in Module 3.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 10 of 14\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nDATE/PREPARER:\n\nFRAME ID: 1080\n\nNEXT FRAME ID: 1081\n\nBACK FRAME ID: 1070\n\nTopic\n(U) Knowledge\nCheck\nHome\n(U) Knowledge Check\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n10 of 12\nBack\n\nNext\n\n1.

The RAS standard is one of these guidelines which helps to provide reasonable assurance that\nonly legitimate terrorism-related identifiers are used to query the bulk metadata. This standard must be met before queries can be conducted.\n(TS//SI//NF) So what is RAS? RAS is a legal standard that describes the measure of proof required to support a decision whether to permit an identifier to\nbe queried from the bulk metadata. The Reasonable Articulable Suspicion standard requires just that-a suspicion that you can explain in a reasonable way.\nIt does not require certainty, but is more concrete than a simple hunch. It may be easiest to think of it in terms of other standards with which you may be\nfamiliar.\n(TS//SI//NF) Many of you may be familiar with legal standards of proof applicable in other situations. It may be helpful to understand how the RAS standard\ncompares to these other legal standards. For example, a jury in a criminal case will not convict an accused unless the evidence of guilt is \"beyond a\nreasonable doubt. \"This is the highest legal standard of proof. A jury in a civil case (such as a personal injury case or a contract dispute) might award a\nplaintiff money damages if the plaintiff proves the elements of his claim by \"a preponderance of the evidence.\" This standard is lower than \"beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\" Lower still is the standard of proof required to justify issuance of a search warrant - \"probable cause\" - whether that search warrant is\nfor the suspect's home or the content of the suspect's communications. The RAS standard falls below \"probable cause.\"\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 4 of 17\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n(TS//SI//NF) The FISC has determined that this lower standard of proof is reasonable for the querying of metadata because communications metadata\ndoes not carry with it the same privacy protections as communications content.

The requirement that these facts be articulable effectively provides reasonable assurance that analyst queries of the\nmetadata are based on substantive information (meaning more than simple hunches or uninformed guesswork). So in order to obtain RAS approval for an\nidentifier, analysts must provide enough factual evidence that it would lead a reasonable person to suspect that an identifier is associated with one of the\nnamed Foreign Powers in the BR and PR/TT Orders. We will get more into the kinds of facts that may be used and how they can support a RAS\nnomination later in this module.\n(TS//SI//NF) In summary, based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life,\ndeterminejifJ.herejisar^asonable articulable suspicion that the identifier is associated with [\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ J n a m e d in the Orders.

Currently a RAS approval on a foreign\nidentifier, per the FISC, is legally valid for one year. However, NSA CT has taken a conservative approach and implemented guidance that mandates RAS\nreview and re-approval every 180 days. Likewise, a RAS approval for an identifier believed to be used by a U.S. person has a legal lifespan of 180 days\nper the FISC, but NSA CT has implemented guidance requiring review and re-approval every 90 days. It is the analyst's responsibility to monitor the sunset\ndates and take appropriate actions before the RAS nomination expires.\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Any identifier can be resubmitted for revalidation at any time. Revalidations require proof of the same categories of\ninformation that was required for the original request. Revalidations should try to validate that the original evidence is still true by presenting any new\ndocumentation to demonstrate that the identifier is still associated with the Foreign Powers named in the Orders. It is up to the HMCs to make an informed\nrevalidation, based on the totality of the evidence.

So, if you knew that identifier A\nbelonged to Joe and identifier B belonged to Sam, and the fact of that contact was derived from BR or PR/TT metadata, if you communicate orally or in\nwriting that Joe talked to Sam, even if you don't include the actual e-mail account or telephone numbers that were used to communicate, this is still a BR or\nPR/TT query result.\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): Remember, if these results are determined to be BR- or PR/TT-UNIQUE, they are subject to sharing and handling\nrestrictions.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 20 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 21 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n•\n•\n\ncontrolled, shared location that is accessible to only BR and PR/TT cleared personnel.\nQuery results cannot be put into any system where the results would be shared with individuals without\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nBR- or PR/TT-unique results may not be queried in tools where user queries are visible to other analysts (who may not h a v e ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ H or\ncan be manipulated by behind the scenes analytics. If you have questions regarding which tools are acceptable to further researcnqueryresults,\nplease contact your management or technical director.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (SV Character) However, as we've discussed, not all BR or PR/TT results are unique. If a query result indicates it was derived from another\ncollection source in addition to BR or PR/TT, the rules governing the other collection authority would apply to the handling and sharing of that query result.\nFor example, this result came from both BR and E.O. 12333 collection; therefore, because it is not unique to BR information, it would be ok to inform nonBR cleared individuals of the fact of this communication, as well as task, query, and report this information according to standard E.O. 12333 guidelines.\n(TS//SI//NF) (SV Character) In summary, if a query result has multiple collection authorities, analysts should source and/or report the non-BR or PR/TT\nversion of that query result according to the rules governing the other authority. But if it is unique to either the BR or PR/TT authority then it is a unique\nquery result with all of the applicable BR and PR/TT restrictions placed on it. In both cases, however, analysts should not share the actual chain containing\nBR or PR/TT results with analysts who do not have the credentials to receive or view B R o r P R / T T information.

For BR- and PR/TT-derived information, the analyst or reporte\nneeds to make sure that the information included in that report is properly sourced to the appropriate BR or PR/TT authority.\n(TS//SI//NF) In addition, the Court Orders for both the BR and PR/TT authorities have imposed two unique, stringent requirements with respect to\ndisseminating information from these authorities. The first is the Counterterrorism, or CT, nexus requirement, and the second is the dissemination tracking\nrequirement.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 29 of 39\n\nC o m m e n t [ S L S 1 8 ] : U P D A T E 7/13/11 from the\nSMEs: Please record at USSID 18 (do not say SPEW\nor SPOW, just \"USSID 18\"\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 30 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Recall the RAS process and how you derived this information. The identifier you used to i lenerate this information was\napproved based upon the RAS standard. It was found to be an identifier reasonably believed to be used by someone I\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): It might seem as though the information would most certainly be counterterrorism-related since, due to the RAS approval\nprocess, you wouldn't have this U.S. person information from a query of BR or PR/TT if it weren't related to counterterrorism. In the majority of cases, it will\nbe counterterrorism-related; however, the nature of the counterterrorism target is that it often overlaps with several other areas that include\ncounternarcotics, counterintelligence, money laundering, document forging, people and weapons trafficking, and other topics that are not CT-centric. Thus,\ndue to the fact that these authorities provide NSA access to a high volume of U.S. person information for counterterrorism purposes, the Court Order\nrequires an explicit finding that the information is in fact related to counterterrorism prior to dissemination. Therefore, one of the approved decision makers\nmust document the finding using the proper terminology. It must state that the information is related to counterterrorism and that it is necessary to\nunderstand the counterterrorism information.\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): While the USSID SP0018 process is the most familiar method of governing the dissemination of unminimized U.S. person\ninformation obtained from traditional SIGINT means, the CT nexus requirement is an additional protection for U.S. person information being disseminated\nwhen the BR or PR/TT authorities, and metadata obtained by virtue of those authorities, is the source of the information. The FISC wants to ensure that the\nauthorities are being used for counterterrorism purposes as intended, so consider the CT nexus requirement a step above justifying a foreign intelligence\nrequirement.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 31 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 32 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): It is important to note that the authority to approve the dissemination of U.S. person information cannot be delegated. This\nresponsibility is assigned only to the positions named in the BR and PR/TT Court Orders. Let's say, for example, that the Chief and Deputy Chief of\nInformation Sharing Services Office, the two individuals who on a normal daily basis would be making the decision, are both on vacation on the same day.\nIn this instance, someone else within their office may be the acting chief on that day; however, the acting chief cannot make the decision to disseminate\nU.S. person information.\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Under these circumstances, if information about a U.S. person must be disseminated on that day, then you should send\nyour dissemination request to one of the other positions named in the Orders. This would logically be the NSOC SOO.\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): With respect to non-U.S. person information, standard NSA practices and policies (such as proper sourcing information)\na\n\npp l y.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 33 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nDATE/PREPARER: 11/23/2010 SLS\n\nTopic\n(U) Dissemination\nRequirements\nHome\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECRET//CO MI NT// NOF ORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n23 of 27\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 4180\n\n(U) Dissemination Tracking\nNEXT FRAME ID: 4190\n\nBACK FRAME ID: 4170\n\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA must report to the FISC every 30 days the number of instances since the\npreceding report in which NSA disseminated BR- or PR/TT-derived information, in any\nform (oral, written, formal, or informal), with anyone outside of NSA\n\nALT TAG:\nGRAPHIC/AV:\n(U) Image of OGC Attorney, HMC\nCharacter, and SV Character sitting at a\ntable\n(U) Possible cutaway images may include:\n•\nImage demonstrating the preparing\nand delivering of a report to the\nFJSC\n\n(U) For more information, please contact\n\n(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): The other requirement, which applies to both U.S. person information as well as foreign person information, is the\ndissemination tracking requirement regarding the dissemination of BR- and PR/TT-derived information. The Orders require NSA to track and report to the\nFISC every instance in which NSA disseminates any information derived from either of these two authorities.\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): This refers to information disseminated in a formal report as well as information disseminated informally such as written or\noral collaboration with the FBI. We need to count every instance in which we take a piece of information derived from either of these two authorities and\ndisseminate it outside of NSA.\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Normally an NSA product report is the record of a formal dissemination. In the context of the BR and PR/TT Programs, an\nofficial RFI response or Analyst Collaboration Record will also be viewed as dissemination. Because this FISC requirement goes beyond the more standard\nNSA procedures, additional diligence must be given to this requirement. NSA is required to report disseminations formal or informal to the FISC every 30\ndays.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage 34 of 39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nDATE/PREPARER: 11/23/2010 SLS\n\nTopic\n(U) Dissemination\nRequirements\nHome\n\nPage Classification\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\nExit\n\nGlossary\n\nScreen Number\n24 of 27\nBack\n\nNext\n\nFRAME ID: 4190\n\n(U) Post-Dissemination Restrictions?

However, because of the different roles and responsibilities of analytical and technical personnel, both\nhave different authorizations to touch the metadata. Recall from Module 1 we defined \"touching the data\" as any form of data handling that creates an\nopportunity for a violation of the FISC Orders to occur. These activities may include data acquisition, modifying/preparing the data, querying, viewing results\nof the queries, and even oversight and compliance functions.\nAnalytic Personnel Info (audio file name C)VSC_1205_M5_5040_A):\n(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Analytic personnel have authorization to touch the metadata to perform intelligence analysis. Analyst actions, such as\nquerying the metadata for intelligence analysis purposes, must be done in a controlled way via tools designed to limit intelligence analysis access to RASapproved identifiers and to the appropriate number of hops. Using these tools also provides reasonable assurance that these queries are tracked and\n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\nPage10of 10\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN\n\nTechnical Personnel Info (audio file name\nOVSC_1205_M5_5040_T):\n(TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): Technical personnel create, test, and implement tools to make this data easier for analytic personnel to use, while\nvalidating that safeguards appropriately control analysts' access to the bulk metadata. Additionally, technical personnel may access the metadata to\nperform those processes needed to make the metadata usable for intelligence,analysis. These processes may include metadata validation; the defeat\nof the collection, processing, or analysis of metadata associated with\nidentifiers; and the maintenance of records to demonstrate\ncompliance with the terms of the authority.\n(TS//SI//NF) In order to do this work effectively, technical personnel are allowed to access the metadata using identifiers that are not RAS-approved. In the\ncase of\nidentifiers, technical personnel may use non-RAS-approved identifiers to query the metadata to confirm if the identifier is\n^ ^ H i d e n t i f i e r and thus should not be included for target analysis. They may then share the identifier and the fact that it is a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ | i d e n t i f i e r\nwith authorized personnel. However, no other information resulting from such queries can be used for intelligence analysis purposes.\n(TS//SI//NF) Technical personnel must take great care with their responsibilities because they may be accessing the data through tools that do not have\nsafeguards, such as ^ • • ^ • t h a t impose restrictions and minimize the chances of a violation of the FISC Orders.

(TS//SI//NF) Both of the Orders set out a standard that allows access to the\ndata when NSA has identified a known telephone number or other electronic identifier\nfor which, based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which\nreasonable and prudent persons act, there are facts giving rise to a reasonable articulable\nsuspicion that the telephone number or electronic identifier4 is associated withl\n[5\n\nÏMT553Ï\n\nprovided, however, that a telephone number or an account or address\n5e used bv a U.S. person shall not be regarded as associated w i t h ^ ^ ^ ^\n\n|solely on the basis of activities that are protected by the First Amendment to\nthe Constitution. When such a determination has been made, NSA is authorized by the\nOrders to use such numbers/electronic identifiers as \"seed\" addresses by querying the\naccumulated data to determine other telephone numbers or electronic identifiers the seed\nhas contacted.\nA. Summary of the Standard\n3. (TS//S1//NF) The \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" standard embodied in the\nCourt's Orders requires that before an analyst may use a telephone number or electronic\nidentifier as a \"seed\" address to query the database of records, he/she must be able to\narticulate some fact or set of facts that causes him/her to suspect that the number is\nformulation means thatanalysts are not\nfree to use a telephone number or electronic identifier based merely on a hunch or guess,\nbut must instead base their decisions on specific facts that would cause a reasonable\nperson to form such a suspicion.\n4. (TS//SI//NF) Note that the standard does not present a particularly high\nhurdle. The level of evidence demanded by the standard is considerably less than proof\nby a preponderance of the evidence, meaning t h a U i e ^ M i ^ i e e ^ o ^ h o ^ U ^ i o r e\nlikely than not that a number is associated with|\n\n! term electronic identifier is intended to include not only email addresses, but also\nsimilar routing and addressing information that effects delivery of electronic communications.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) The phrase \"associated terrorist organization\" connotes a particular list of\nlie Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to have allied themselves witfa|\n\nThe specific list is included in the FISC orders.\n\n(U//FOUO) The reasonable articulable suspicion standard comes from the law enforcement context and\ntherefore the cases addressing it focus on actions of police officers. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).\nThe idea underpinning the standard is that the police may stop and briefly detain someone for investigative\npurposes if the officer involved has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal\nactivity \"may be afoot,\" even where the officer lacks probable cause to believe that this is so. See U.S. v.\nSokolow, 490 U.S. 1,7 (1989). The officer must be able to articulate something more than an \"inchoate\nand unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch.' \" Terry at 27. Rather, the standard demands some \"minimal\nlevel of objective justification\" for making the stop in question. INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210,217 (1984).\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\n\fSUBJECT TO TIIE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND THE ATTORNEY WORK-PRODI IfT DOCTRINE;\nDO NOT RELEASE OUTSIDE OF NSA WITHOUT OGC APPROVAL\n\nTOP SECRET//COMIOT//NOFORN\n\nSee\nSokolow at 7. Indeed, the Courts have made clear that the level of suspicion required for\na Terry stop - i.e. the level of suspicion required to constitute a reasonable articulable\nsuspicion -- is \"obviously less demanding than that for probable cause.\" Id. {citations\nomitted.)1 Further, the Sokolow Court observed that the concept of reasonable suspicion,\nlike probable cause, requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances - the\nwhole picture. Id., citing U.S. v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411,417 (1981). The Sokolow Court,\nquoting one of its earlier cases, noted that \"[t]he process does not deal with hard\ncertainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as\nsuch, practical people formulated certain common-sense conclusions about human\nbehavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same - and so are law enforcement\nofficers.\" See Cortez at 418.\n5.

(TS//SI//NF) As we alluded to above, the meaning of the word \"associated\" is\nimportant to the analysis, since the determination that must be made is that a telephone\nnumber or electronic identifier is associated wit\npignated by the DNI to have allied itself|\nWhile this standard does not say explicitly that the t e l e p t o ^ ^ ^ ^\nLfier at issue must be used by a member or agent o f ^ ^ ^ ^ H\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ J a n d while we do not insist on such a finding here, we note that\nthe dictionary definition of \"associate\" suggests a knowing relationship and engagement\nin a common enterprise.9 Therefore, in making their assessments, analysts should\nconsider whether, given the totality of the circumstances, there exist articula\"*\nthink that a telephone number or electronic identifier bears a relationship to|\nlor one of the groups designated by the DNI to have allied itself\n\n(U) Reasonable articulable suspicion is a low standard of proof. The common standards of proof and\ncommon applications of the standards are set out inJinclosur^L\nI would meet the stam\nprobable cause or higher showing.\n(U//F©UO)-For example, \"associate\" is defined as follows: \"to join as a partner, friend or companion; to\nkeep company with;\" and also: \"to combine or join with other parts.\" Merriam Webster Collegiate\nDictionary, Tenth Edition, at 70.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fSUBJECT TO TIIE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND THE ATTORNEY WORK-PRODI I f T DOCTRINE;\nDO NOT RELEASE OUTSIDE OF NSA WITHOUT OGC APPROVAL\n\nTOP SECRET//COMIOT//NOFORN\n\na nature that suggests\nengaged in a common enterprise with one of the aforementioned.\n\nused by someone\n\n7. (TS//SI//NF) We recognize too that there may be cases in which an analyst's\n?le articulable suspicion that a number is associated wit\n, will be based on telephone or e-mail contacts alone. While basing a\ndetermination on more information than this is preferable (and indeed is required to the\ndegree more information is available, since one is required to examine the totality of the\ncircumstances), analysts must when premising their determinations solely on contact be\nmindful of what they actually know about the parties involved. For example, an analyst\nwho has reasonable articulable suspicion with respect to a particular telephone number\ncould not query the database to determine what number is three \"hops\" away in the\ncommunications chain, and then, based on such contact alone, conclude that the number\nthree hops away now should be used as a seed number. Therefore, in cases in which\ncommunications contacts are the sole justification for concluding that a number is\nassociated with|\nsuch contact must (1) be direct contact, and\n(?) must he with a number or electronic identifier for which we have concluded it is more\nlikely than not used by a member of\nC. First Amendment Considerations\n8. (TS//SI//NF) In addition, the Orders each contain a provision stating that a\ntelephone number or electronic \"\nssociated with I\nactivities that are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.\n9. (TS//SI//NF) We read the Orders as barring NSA from concluding -- based on\nsuch things as the religion of the U.S. person, or his editorials contending that the United\nStates is wrong in its war on terrorism, or his membership in groups that oppose policies\nof the United States, or the fact that he/she attends anti-war demonstrations and urges his\n\n(TS//SI//NF) In order to establish a meaningful association from contact alone between the two numbers,\nA and B, where B is a number that is a l r e a d ^ u s g e c t J ^ j j ^ ^ o r y i k e l ^ u e than not true that number\nB is used by e.g., a member o r a g e n t o f ^ H H ^ H ^ ^ ^ H ^ ^ H Neither vague statements\nabout the role of Party B in ^ • M H ^ ^ ^ ^ H ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ H n o r a n m d i r e c t linking of the number\nin question with Party B\nA was in contact with Party X, who was in contact with Party B, who\nis probably a member o f ^ ^ ^ H will suffice on their own to satisfy the standard as to Party A. Where\nthe reasombl^irticulab^\nalone, such contact must be direct with a member\nor agent\nand it must be more likely than not that our designation\nof such member or agent is in fact accurate. This advice should help serve to prevent the potential for\nendless \"bootstrapping.\" As we have discussed, the danger in carrying out the i n s t i ^ ^ m n the Court's\nOrder is a suspicion that ceases to be reasonable because of the tenuousness of t h e ^ ^ ^ J connection.\nWe believe that this analytic framework will go a long way to countering any such tendency that might\nexist. See enclosure 2.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fSUBJECT TO TIIE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND THE ATTORNEY WORK-PRODI IfT DOCTRINE;\nDO NOT RELEASE OUTSIDE OF NSA WITHOUT OGC APPROVAL\n\nTOP SECRET//COMIOT//NOFORN\n\nwhich NSA has the appropriate level of suspicion. Our conclusion is supported by First\nAmendment law, as we discuss below.\n10. (U//FOUO) The First Amendment by its terms makes clear that Congress\ncan make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or abridging freedom of speech\nor of the press, or peaceable assembly, or the petitioning of the government for the\nredress of grievances.\n11. (U//FOUO) In addition, the Amendment has also been construed by Courts to\nprotect the freedom of association, a freedom not explicitly mentioned in its text. The\nCourts have opined that the right of association implied in the Constitution mainly\nprotects associations when they are derivative of other First Amendment guarantees normally speech, assembly and petition. For instance, in a case examining a university's\ndecision to refuse recognition to a student organization, Students for a Democratic\nSociety, the Supreme Court stated: \"While freedom of association is not explicitly set out\nin the Amendment, it has long been held to be implicit in the freedoms of speech,\nassembly and petition. Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,181 (1972) {citations omitted)\n(emphasis added). Similarly, in one of many cases in which the issue was whether the\ngovernment could compel an organization to turn over lists of its members, the Supreme\nCourt observed that \"[i]t is now beyond dispute that freedom of association for the\npurpose of advancing ideas and airing grievances is protected by [the constitution] from\ninvasion by the States.\" Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 522-523 (I960)\n{emphasis added)}1\n12. (U//FOUO) By contrast, simple social contacts that do not rise to the level of\norganizations or associations erected for the purpose of engaging in speech do not enjoy\nthe same degree of protection. For example, the Supreme Court, addressing the question\nwhether the state could restrict admission to dance halls to persons between 14 and 18\nyears old, rejected a challenge based on the right of association and held that the state did\nindeed have such authority. In so doing, the Court found that there does not exist a\n\"generalized right of 'social association' that includes chance encounters in dance halls.\"\nSee City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25 (1989).12\n\n(U) The First Amendment also protects \"intimate associations\" among family members, permitting the\ngovernment to infringe on such interests only to serve a compelling interest, and to do so in the manner that\nis least intrusive. See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609,619-620 (1984).\n\n(TS//SI/NF) We note also that the very object of the overall effort supported by these Orders is to\ndetermine whether or not particular individuals are members of or are associated with the terrorist\norganizations named in the Orders. Thus, under these Orders, simply by being a member of a named group\none becomes subject to government scrutiny.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fSUBJECT TO TIIE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND THE ATTORNEY WORK-PRODI IfT DOCTRINE;\nDO NOT RELEASE OUTSIDE OF NSA WITHOUT OGC APPROVAL\n\nTOP SECRET//COMIOT//NOFORN\n\n13. <G) The fact that these Orders only concern communications routing\ninformation, or metadata, rather than the substance of communications, further\nunderscores the limited relevance of the First Amendment in the context of association.\nThe D.C. Circuit observed in 1978 that data-gathering activities using legitimate\ninvestigative techniques do not violate the First Amendment, at least where no Fourth\nAmendment privacy is infringed. See Reporters ' Committee for Freedom of the Press v.\nAT&T, 593 F.2d 1030,1064 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Since individuals do not enjoy a\nreasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment in the communications\nmetadata NSA acquires under these Orders, Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), the\ninvestigative techniques NSA uses pursuant to the Orders do not run afoul of the First\nAmendment. As the Court in the Reporters ' Committee case observed, the First\nAmendment offers no procedural or substantive protection from good faith criminal\ninvestigation beyond that afforded by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Reporters '\nCommittee at 1057.\n14. (TS//SI//NF) The above makes clear that the Courts have fashioned\nprotections for association in order to preserve the other rights guaranteed by the\nConstitution in the First Amendment. Since the right to free association has been found\nby Courts to be protected largely as an extension of the other constitutional protections in\norder to keep these rights from being frustrated, and because the derivative right to\nassociate is subsumed by the more specific rights enumerated in the Amendment, we\nconclude that the terms of the Court's Orders are not intended in the context of these\nOrders to preclude entirely the conclusion of association based on communications\ncontact observed in communications metadata. We therefore advise that NSA is ^ ^\nobligated by the terms of these Orders to refrain from finding an association w i t h ^ B\n¡based solely on these activities that are explicitly atlord\nprotection by the language of First Amendment. But NSA is not precluded from finding\njiatiory>ase(k)iKlire^\nso long as such contact is direct and the evidence shows it more likely than not that the\nputative member of an aforementioned group is in fact a member.\nD. Summary\n15. (TS//SI//NF) Analysts making a determination as to whether a telephone\nnumber or electronic identifier is eligible to be a \"seed\" must consider all the facts that\nthey know or reasonably can know prior to engaging in contact chaining. Looking at the\ntotality of the circumstances, the whole picture, they must determine whether a\nreasonable articulable snsnir.inn twists that the telenhone number or electronic identifier\nth|\n|\n| is there reason to suspect that the person using\"\nThe evidence required is\nconsiderably less than a showing that it is more likely than not that a number is associated\nwith one of the aforementioned.

The standards are listed from the highest standard to the lowest.\nStandard of Proof\n\nApplication\n\nBeyond a Reasonable Doubt\n\nRequired for criminal conviction.1\n\nClear and Convincing Evidence\n\nRequired to prevail in some civil actions.\n\nPreponderance of Evidence\n\nRequired to prevail in most civil cases. The\nstandard is met if the proposition is more\nlikely to be true than not true.\n\nProbable Cause\n\nRequired for search and arrest warrants.3\n\nReasonable Articulable Suspicion\n\nRequired for \"Terry\" (investigative) stop; see\npp. 2-3 of memorandum.\n\n\nThis standard historically has been reserved for criminal cases. The Supreme Court has held that \"the\nDue Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nof every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\" In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358,364\n(1970).\nA landmark Supreme Court case reviewing the standard of proof required for involuntary commitment of\nan individual held that an individual's \"interest in the outcome of a civil commitment proceeding is of such\nweight and gravity that due process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than\na mere preponderance of the evidence.\" The Court held that the \"clear and convincing\" standard was\nrequired to meet due process guarantees.. Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418,427 (1979).\nThe Supreme Court has held probable cause to mean \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\ncrime will be found.\" Illinois v.

(U) The Fou rth Amendment to the U nited States Constitution protects all\nU.S. persons anywhere in the world and all persons within the U nited States\nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures by any person or agency acting on\nbehalf of the U.S. Government. The Supreme Court has ruled that the\ninterception of electronic communicatio ns is a search and seizure within the\nmeaning oft he Fourth Amendment. It is therefore mandatory that signals\nintelligence (SIGINT) operations be conducted pursuant to procedures which\nmeet the reasonableness requirements ofthe FoUI1h Amendment.\n\n(U) Balancing\nForeign\nIntelligence Need\nand Privacy\nInterest\n\n1.2. (0) In determining whether United States SIGINT System (OSSS)\noperations are \"reasonable,\" it is necessa1y to balance the US. Government's\nneed for foreign intelligence information and the privacy interests ofpersons\nprotected by the FoUI1h Amendment. Striking that balance has consumed much\ntime and effort by all branches of the U nited States Government. The results of\nthat eff011 are reflected in the references li sted in Section 2 below. Together,\nthese references require the minimization ofU. S. person information collected,\nprocessed , retained or disseminated by the USSS. The purpose of this document\n\nSECRET//Sf//REL TO USA, FVEY\n\n\fDOCID: 4086222\nSECR:E'f//SINREL 'fO USA F¥EY\nis to implement these minimization requirements.\n1.3. (0) Several themes mn throughout this USSID. The most important is that\nintelligence operations and the protection of constitutional rights are not\nincompatible. It is not necessary to deny legitimate foreign intelligence\ncollection or suppress legitimate foreign intelligence information to protect the\nFot11ih Amendment rights ofU.S. persons.\n\n(U) Minimization\nof U.S. Person\nInformation\n\n1.4. (0) These minimization procedures implement the constitutional principle\nof\"reasonableness\" by giving different categories of individuals and entities\ndifferent levels of protection. These levels range from the stringent protection\naccorded U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens in the United States to\nprovisions relating to foreign dip lomats in the U.S. These differences reflect yet\nanother main theme of these procedures, that is, that the focus of all foreign\nintelligence operations is on foreig n entities and persons.\n\n(U) Oversight\nFunctions\n\n1.5. (0) Nothing in these procedures shall restrict the performance oflawful\ncompliance or oversight functions over the USSS.\n\nSECTION 2 - (U) REFERENCES\n(U) References\n\n2. 1 (U) The following documents are references to this USSID:\n•\n\n(U) 50 U.S. C. 1801 , et seq. , Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n(FISA) of 1978, as amended .\n\n•\n\n(U) Executive Order 12333, \"United States Intelligence Activities,\" as\namended 30 July 2008.\n\n•\n\n(U) (U) DoD Directive 5240.01 , \"DoD Intelligence Activities,\" dated 27\nAugust 2007.\n\n•\n\n(0) NSA/CSS Policy No. 1-23 , \"Procedu res Governing NSA/CSS\nActivities that affect U.S. Persons,\" as revised 29 May 2009.\n\n•\n\n(lJ) DoD Regulation 5240.1 -R, \"Procedures Governing the Activities of\nDoD Intelligence Components that Affect United States Person,\" dated\nDecember 1982.\n\nSECTION 3- (U) POLICY\n(UUS)SPSolicy ~nd the 3.1.

DEFINITIONS\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nAs the primary investigative agency of the federal government, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) has the authority and responsibility to investigate all violations of federal law\nthat are not exclusively assigned to another federal agency. The FBI is further vested by law and\nby Presidential directives with the primary role in carrying out investigations within the United\nStates of threats to the national security. This includes the lead domestic role in investigating\ninternational terrorist threats to the United States, and in conducting counterintelligence activities\nto meet foreign entities' espionage and intelligence efforts directed against the United States.\nThe FBI is also vested with important functions in collecting foreign intelligence as a member\nagency of the U.S. Intelligence Community. The FBI accordingly plays crucial roles in the\nenforcement of federal law and the proper administration of justice in the United States, in the\nprotection of the national security, and in obtaining information needed by the United States for\nthe conduct of its foreign affairs. These roles reflect the wide range of the FBI's current\nresponsibilities and obligations, which require the FBI to be both an agency that effectively\ndetects, investigates, and prevents crimes, and an agency that effectively protects the national\nsecurity and collects intelligence.\nThe general objective of these Guidelines is the full utilization of all authorities and\ninvestigative methods, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, to protect\nthe United States and its people from terrorism and other threats to the national security, to\nprotect the United States and its people from victimization by all crimes in violation of federal\nlaw, and to further the foreign intelligence objectives of the United States. At the same time, it is\naxiomatic that the FBI must conduct its investigations and other activities in a lawful and\nreasonable manner that respects liberty and privacy and avoids unnecessary intrusions into the\nlives of law-abiding people. The purpose of these Guidelines, therefore, is to establish consistent\npolicy in such matters. They will enable the FBI to perform its duties with effectiveness,\ncertainty, and confidence, and will provide the American people with a firm assurance that the\nFBI is acting properly under the law,\nThe issuance of these Guidelines represents the culmination of the historical evolution of\nthe FBI and the policies governing its domestic operations subsequent to the September 11, 2001,\nterrorist attacks on the United States. Reflecting decisions and directives of the President and the\nAttorney General, inquiries and enactments of Congress, and the conclusions of national\ncommissions, it was recognized that the FBI's functions needed to be expanded and better\nintegrated to meet contemporary realities:\n[Continuing coordination . . . is necessary to optimize the FBI's performance in\nboth national security and criminal investigations . . . . [The] new reality requires first\nthat the FBI and other agencies do a better job of gathering intelligence inside the United\nStates, and second that we eliminate the remnants of the old \"wall\" between foreign\nintelligence and domestic law enforcement. Both tasks must be accomplished without\nsacrificing our domestic liberties and the rule of law, and both depend on building a very\n\n\fdifferent FBI from the one we had on September 10, 2001. (Report of the Commission\non the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass\nDestruction 466, 452 (2005).)\nIn line with these objectives, the FBI has reorganized and reoriented its programs and\nmissions, and the guidelines issued by the Attorney General for FBI operations have been\nextensively revised over the past several years. Nevertheless, the principal directives of the\nAttorney General governing the FBI's conduct of criminal investigations, national security\ninvestigations, and foreign intelligence collection have persisted as separate documents involving\ndifferent standards and procedures for comparable activities. These Guidelines effect a more\ncomplete integration and harmonization of standards, thereby providing the FBI and other\naffected Justice Department components with clearer, more consistent, and more accessible\nguidance for their activities, and making available to the public in a single document the basic\nbody of rules for the FBI's domestic operations.\nThese Guidelines also incorporate effective oversight measures involving many\nDepartment of Justice and FBI components, which have been adopted to ensure that all FBI\nactivities arc conducted in a manner consistent with law and policy.\nThe broad operational areas addressed by these Guidelines are the FBI's conduct of\ninvestigative and intelligence gathering activities, including cooperation and coordination with\nother components and agencies in such activities, and the intelligence analysis and planning\nfunctions of the FBI.\nA.\n\nFBI RESPONSIBILITIES - FEDERAL CRIMES, THREATS TO THE\nNATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE\n\nPart n of these Guidelines authorizes the FBI to carry out investigations to detect, obtain\ninformation about, or prevent or protect against federal crimes or threats to the national security\nor to collect foreign intelligence. The major subject areas of information gathering activities\nunder these Guidelines - federal crimes, threats to the national security, and foreign intelligence\n- are not distinct, but rather overlap extensively. For example, an investigation relating to\ninternational terrorism will invariably crosscut these areas because international terrorism is\nincluded under these Guidelines' definition of \"threat to the national security,\" because\ninternational terrorism subject to investigation within the United States usually involves criminal\nacts that violate federal law, and because information relating to international terrorism also falls\nwithin the definition of \"foreign intelligence.\" Likewise, counterintelligence activities relating to\nespionage are likely to concern matters that constitute threats to the national security, that\nimplicate violations or potential violations of federal espionage laws, and that involve\ninformation falling under the definition of \"foreign intelligence.\"\nWhile some distinctions in the requirements and procedures for investigations are\nnecessary in different subject areas, the general design of these Guidelines is to take a uniform\n\n\fapproach wherever possible, thereby promoting certainty and consistency regarding the\napplicable standards and facilitating compliance with those standards. Hence, these Guidelines\ndo not require that the FBI's information gathering activities be differentially labeled as \"criminal\ninvestigations,\" \"national security investigations,\" or \"foreign intelligence collections,\" or that\nthe categories of FBI personnel who carry out investigations be segregated from each other based\non the subject areas in which they operate. Rather, all of the FBI's legal authorities are available\nfor deployment in all cases to which they apply to protect the public from crimes and threats to\nthe national security and to further the United States' foreign intelligence objectives. In many\ncases, a single investigation will be supportable as an exercise of a number of these authorities i.e., as an investigation of a federal crime or crimes, as an investigation of a threat to the national\nsecurity, and/or as a collection of foreign intelligence.\n1.\n\nFederal Crimes\n\nThe FBI has the authority to investigate all federal crimes that are not exclusively\nassigned to other agencies. In most ordinary criminal investigations, the immediate objectives\ninclude such matters as: determining whether a federal crime has occurred or is occurring, or if\nplanning or preparation for such a crime is taking place; identifying, locating, and apprehending\nthe perpetrators; and obtaining the evidence needed for prosecution. Hence, close cooperation\nand coordination with federal prosecutors in the United States Attorneys' Offices and the Justice\nDepartment litigating divisions are essential both to ensure that agents have the investigative\ntools and legal advice at their disposal for which prosecutorial assistance or approval is needed,\nand to ensure that investigations are conducted in a manner that will lead to successful\nprosecution. Provisions in many parts of these Guidelines establish procedures and requirements\nfor such coordination.\n2.\n\nThreats to the National Security\n\nThe FBI's authority to investigate threats to the national security derives from the\nexecutive order concerning U.S. intelligence activities, from delegations of functions by the\nAttorney General, and from various statutory sources. See, e.g., E.O. 12333; 50 U.S.C. 401 et\nseq.; 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. These Guidelines (Part VTLS) specifically define threats to the\nnational security to mean: international terrorism; espionage and other intelligence activities,\nsabotage, and assassination, conducted by, for, or on behalf of foreign powers, organizations, or\npersons; foreign computer intrusion; and other matters determined by the Attorney General,\nconsistent with Executive Order 12333 or any successor order.\nActivities within the definition of \"threat to the national security\" that are subject to\ninvestigation under these Guidelines commonly involve violations (or potential violations) of\nfederal criminal laws. Hence, investigations of such threats may constitute an exercise both of\nthe FBI's criminal investigation authority and of the FBI's authority to investigate threats to the\nnational security. As with criminal investigations generally, detecting and solving the crimes,\nand eventually arresting and prosecuting the perpetrators, are likely to be among the objectives of\n\n\finvestigations relating to threats to the national security. But these investigations also often serve\nimportant purposes outside the ambit of normal criminal investigation and prosecution, by\nproviding the basis for, and informing decisions concerning, other measures needed to protect the\nnational security. These measures may include, for example: excluding or removing persons\ninvolved in terrorism or espionage from the United States; recruitment of double agents; freezing\nassets of organizations that engage in or support terrorism; securing targets of terrorism or\nespionage; providing threat information and warnings to other federal, state, local, and private\nagencies and entities; diplomatic or military actions; and actions by other intelligence agencies to\ncounter international terrorism or other national security threats.\nIn line with this broad range of purposes, investigations of threats to the national security\npresent special needs to coordinate with other Justice Department components, including\nparticularly the Justice Department's National Security Division, and to share information and\ncooperate with other agencies with national security responsibilities, including other agencies of\nthe U.S. Intelligence Community, the Department of Homeland Security, and relevant White\nHouse (including National Security Council and Homeland Security Council) agencies and\nentities. Various provisions in these Guidelines establish procedures and requirements to\nfacilitate such coordination.\n3.\n\nForeign Intelligence\n\nAs with the investigation of threats to the national security, the FBI's authority to collect\nforeign intelligence derives from a mixture of administrative and statutory sources. See, e.g.,\nE.O. 12333; 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.; 28 U.S.C. 532 note (incorporating\nP.L. 108-458 §§ 2001-2003). These Guidelines (Part VILE) define foreign intelligence to mean\n\"information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or\nelements thereof, foreign organizations or foreign persons, or international terrorists.\"\nThe FBI's foreign intelligence collection activities have been expanded by legislative and\nadministrative reforms subsequent to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, reflecting the\nFBI's role as the primary collector of foreign intelligence within the United States, and the\nrecognized imperative that the United States' foreign intelligence collection activities become\nmore flexible, more proactive, and more efficient in order to protect the homeland and adequately\ninform the United States' crucial decisions in its dealings with the rest of the world:\nThe collection of information is the foundation of everything that the Intelligence\nCommunity does. While successful collection cannot ensure a good analytical product,\nthe failure to collect information . . . turns analysis into guesswork. And as our review\ndemonstrates, the Intelligence Community's human and technical intelligence collection\nagencies have collected far too little information on many of the issues we care about\nmost. (Report of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States\nRegarding Weapons of Mass Destruction 351 (2005).)\n\n\fThese Guidelines accordingly provide standards and procedures for the FBI's foreign intelligence\ncollection activities that meet current needs and realities and optimize the FBI's ability to\ndischarge its foreign intelligence collection functions.\nThe authority to collect foreign intelligence extends the sphere of the FBI's information\ngathering activities beyond federal crimes and threats to the national security, and permits the\nFBI to seek information regarding a broader range of matters relating to foreign powers,\norganizations, or persons that may be of interest to the conduct of the United States' foreign\naffairs. The FBI's role is central to the effective collection of foreign intelligence within the\nUnited States because the authorized domestic activities of other intelligence agencies are more\nconstrained than those of the FBI under applicable statutes and Executive Order 12333. In\ncollecting foreign intelligence, the FBI will generally be guided by nationally-determined\nintelligence requirements, including the National Intelligence Priorities Framework and the\nNational HUMINT Collection Directives, or any successor directives issued under the authority\nof the Director of National Intelligence (DN1). As provided in Part VHF of these Guidelines,\nforeign intelligence requirements may also be established by the President or Intelligence\nCommunity officials designated by the President, and by the Attorney General, the Deputy\nAttorney General, or an official designated by the Attorney General.\nThe general guidance of the FBI's foreign intelligence collection activities by DNIauthorized requirements does not, however, limit the FBI's authority to conduct investigations\nsupportable on the basis of its other authorities - to investigate federal crimes and threats to the\nnational security - in areas in which the information sought also falls under the definition of\nforeign intelligence. The FBI conducts investigations of federal crimes and threats to the\nnational security based on priorities and strategic objectives set by the Department of Justice and\nthe FBI, independent of DNI-established foreign intelligence collection requirements.\nSince the authority to collect foreign intelligence enables the FBI to obtain information\npertinent to the United States' conduct of its foreign affairs, even if that information is not related\nto criminal activity or threats to the national security, the information so gathered may concern\nlawful activities. The FBI should accordingly operate openly and consensually with U.S. persons\nto the extent practicable when collecting foreign intelligence that does not concern criminal\nactivities or threats to the national security.\nB.\n\nTHE FBI AS AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\nThe FBI is an intelligence agency as well as a law enforcement agency. Its basic\nfunctions accordingly extend beyond limited investigations of discrete matters, and include\nbroader analytic and planning functions. The FBI's responsibilities in this area derive from\nvarious administrative and statutory sources. See, e.g., E.O. 12333; 28 U.S.C. 532 note\n(incorporating P.L. 108-458 §§ 2001-2003) and 534 note (incorporating P.L. 109-162 § 1107).\nEnhancement of the FBI's intelligence analysis capabilities and functions has consistently been\nrecognized as a key priority in the legislative and administrative reform efforts following the\n\n\fSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks:\n[Counterterrorism] strategy should . . . encompass specific efforts to . . . enhance the\ndepth and quality of domestic intelligence collection and analysis . . . . [T]he FBI should\nstrengthen and improve its domestic [intelligence] capability as fully and expeditiously as\npossible by immediately instituting measures to . . . significantly improve strategic\nanalytical capabilities . . . . (Joint Inquiiy into Intelligence Community Activities Before\nand After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, S. Rep. No. 351 & H.R. Rep. No.\n792, 107th Cong., 2d Sess. 4-7 (2002) (errata print).)\nA \"smart\" government would integrate all sources of information to see the enemy as a\nwhole. Integrated all-source analysis should also inform and shape strategies to collect\nmore intelligence.. . . The importance of integrated, all-source analysis cannot be\noverstated. Without it, it is not possible to \"connect the dots.\" (Final Report of the\nNational Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States 401, 408 (2004).)\nPart IV of these Guidelines accordingly authorizes the FBI to engage in intelligence\nanalysis and planning, drawing on all lawful sources of information. The functions authorized\nunder that Part include: (i) development of overviews and analyses concerning threats to and\nvulnerabilities of the United States and its interests, (ii) research and analysis to produce reports\nand assessments concerning matters relevant to investigative activities or other authorized FBI\nactivities, and (iii) the operation of intelligence systems that facilitate and support investigations\nthrough the compilation and analysis of data and information on an ongoing basis.\nC.\n\nOVERSIGHT\n\nThe activities authorized by these Guidelines must be conducted in a maimer consistent\nwith all applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including those protecting privacy and civil\nliberties. The Justice Department's National Security Division and the FBI's Inspection\nDivision, Office of General Counsel, and Office of Integrity and Compliance, along with other\ncomponents, share the responsibility to ensure that the Department meets these goals with respect\nto national security and foreign intelligence matters. In particular, the National Security\nDivision's Oversight Section, in conjunction with the FBI's Office of General Counsel, is\nresponsible for conducting regular reviews of all aspects of FBI national security and foreign\nintelligence activities. These reviews, conducted at FBI field offices and headquarter units,\nbroadly examine such activities for compliance with these Guidelines and other applicable\nrequirements.\nVarious features of these Guidelines facilitate the National Security Division's oversight\nfunctions. Relevant requirements and provisions include: (i) required notification by the FBI to\nthe National Security Division concerning full investigations that involve foreign intelligence\ncollection or investigation of United States persons in relation to threats of the national security,\n(ii) annual reports by the FBI to the National Security Division concerning the FBI's foreign\n\n\fintelligence collection program, including information on the scope and nature of foreign\nintelligence collection activities in each FBI field office, and (iii) access by the National Security\nDivision to information obtained by the FBI through national security or foreign intelligence\nactivities and general authority for the Assistant Attorney General for National Security to obtain\nreports from the FBI concerning these activities.\nPursuant to thesis Guidelines, other Attorney General guidelines, and institutional\nof responsibility within the Justice Department, additional Department components\n- including the Criminal Division, the United States Attorneys' Offices, and the Office of\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties - are involved in the common endeavor with the FBI of ensuring that\nthe activities of all Department components are lawful, appropriate, and ethical as well as\neffective. Examples include the involvement of both FBI and prosecutorial personnel in the\nreview of undercover operations involving sensitive circumstances, notice requirements for\ninvestigations involving sensitive investigative matters (as defined in Part VTI.N of these\nGuidelines), and notice and oversight provisions for enterprise investigations, which may involve\nabroad examination of groups implicated in the gravest criminal and national security threats.\nThese requirements and procedures help to ensure that the rale of law is respected in the\nDepartment's activities and that public confidence is maintained in these activities.\nassignments\n\n\n\fI.\n\nGENERAL AUTHORITIES AND PRINCIPLES\n\nA.\n\nSCOPE\nThese Guidelines apply to investigative activities conducted by the FBI within the United\nStates or outside the territories of all countries. They do not apply to investigative\nactivities of the FBI in foreign countries, which are governed by the Attorney General's\nGuidelines for Extraterritorial FBI Operations.\n\nBo\n\nC.\n\nGENERAL AUTHORITIES\n1.\n\nThe FBI is authorized to conduct investigations to detect, obtain information\nabout, and prevent and protect against federal crimes and threats to the national\nsecurity and to collect foreign intelligence, as provided in Part n of these\nGuidelines.\n\n2.\n\nThe FBI is authorized to provide investigative assistance to other federal agencies,\nstate, local, or tribal agencies, and foreign agencies as provided in Part HI of these\nGuidelines.\n\n3.\n\nThe FBI is authorized to conduct intelligence analysis and planning as provided in\nPart IV of these Guidelines.\n\n4.\n\nThe FBI is authorized to retain and share information obtained pursuant to these\nGuidelines as provided in Part VI of these Guidelines.\n\nUSE OF AUTHORITIES AND METHODS\n1.\n\nProtection of the United States and Its People\nThe FBI shall fully utilize the authorities provided and the methods authorized by\nthese Guidelines to protect the United States and its people from crimes in\nviolation of federal law and threats to the national security, and to further the\nforeign intelligence objectives of the United States.\n\n2.\n\nChoice of Methods\na.\n\nThe conduct of investigations and other activities authorized by these\nGuidelines may present choices between the use of different investigative\nmethods that are each operationally sound and effective, but that are more\nor less intrusive, considering such factors as the effect on the privacy and\ncivil liberties of individuals and potential damage to reputation. The least\nintrusive method feasible is to be used in such situations. It is recognized,\n\n\fhowever, that the choice of methods is a matter of judgment. The FBI\nshall not hesitate to use any lawful method consistent with these\nGuidelines, even if intrusive, where the degree of intrusiveness is\nwarranted in light of the seriousness of a criminal or national security\nthreat or the strength of the information indicating its existence, or in light\nof the importance of foreign intelligence sought to the United States'\ninterests. This point is to be particularly observed in investigations\nrelating to terrorism.\nb.\n3.\n\nUnited States persons shall be dealt with openly and consensually to the\nextent practicable when collecting foreign intelligence that does not\nconcern criminal activities or threats to the national security.\n\nRespect for Legal Rights\nAll activities under these Guidelines must have a valid purpose consistent with\nthese Guidelines, and must be carried out in conformity with the Constitution and\nall applicable statutes, executive orders, Department of Justice regulations and\npolicies, and Attorney General guidelines. These Guidelines do not authorize\ninvestigating or collecting or maintaining information on United States persons\nsolely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment\nor the lawful exercise of other rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the\nUnited States. These Guidelines also do not authorize any conduct prohibited by\nthe Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies.\n\n4.\n\nUndisclosed Participation in Organizations\nUndisclosed participation in organizations in activities under these Guidelines\nshall be conducted in accordance with FBI policy approved by the Attorney\nGeneral.\n\n5.\n\nMaintenance of Records under the Privacy Act\nThe Privacy Act restricts the maintenance of records relating to certain activities\nof individuals who are United States persons, with exceptions for circumstances\nin which the collection of such information is pertinent to and within the scope of\nan authorized law enforcement activity or is otherwise authorized by statute. 5\nU.S.C. 552a(e)(7). Activities authorized by these Guidelines are authorized law\nenforcement activities or activities for which there is otherwise statutory authority\nfor purposes of the Privacy Act. These Guidelines, however, do not provide an\nexhaustive enumeration of authorized FBI law enforcement activities or FBI\nactivities for which there is otherwise statutory authority, and no restriction is\nimplied with respect to such activities carried out by the FBI pursuant to other\n\n\fauthorities. Further questions about the application of the Privacy Act to\nauthorized activities of the FBI should be addressed to the FBI Office of the\nGeneral Counsel, the FBI Privacy and Civil Liberties Unit, or the Department of\nJustice Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties.\nD.\n\nNATURE AND APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES\n1.\n\nRepealers\nThese Guidelines supersede the following guidelines, which are hereby repealed:\n\n2.\n\na.\n\nThe Attorney General's Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering\nEnterprise and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations (May 30, 2002) and all\npredecessor guidelines thereto.\n\nb.\n\nThe Attorney General's Guidelines for FBI National Security\nInvestigations and Foreign Intelligence Collection (October 31, 2003) and\nall predecessor guidelines thereto.\n\nc.\n\nThe Attorney General's Supplemental Guidelines for Collection,\nRetention, and Dissemination of Foreign Intelligence (November 29,\n2006).\n\nd.\n\nThe Attorney General Procedure for Reporting and Use of Information\nConcerning Violations of Law and Authorization for Participation in\nOtherwise Illegal Activity in FBI Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence\nor International Terrorism Intelligence Investigations (August 8, 1988).\n\ne.\n\nThe Attorney General's Guidelines for Reporting on Civil Disorders and\nDemonstrations Involving a Federal Interest (April 5, 1976).\n\nStatus as Internal Guidance\nThese Guidelines are set forth solely for the purpose of internal Department of\nJustice guidance. They are not intended to, do not, and may not be relied upon to\ncreate any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in\nany matter, civil or criminal, nor do they place any limitation on otherwise lawful\ninvestigative and litigative prerogatives of the Department of Justice.\n\n3.\n\nDepartures from the Guidelines\nDepartures from these Guidelines must be approved by the Director of the FBI, by\nthe Deputy Director of the FBI, or by an Executive Assistant Director designated\n\n\fby the Director. If a departure is necessary without such prior approval because of\nthe immediacy or gravity of a threat to the safety of persons or property or to the\nnational security, the Director, the Deputy Director, or a designated Executive\nAssistant Director shall be notified as soon thereafter as practicable. The FBI\nshall provide timely written notice of departures from these Guidelines to the\nCriminal Division and the National Security Division, and those divisions shall\nnotify the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General. Notwithstanding\nthis paragraph, all activities in all circumstances must be carried out in a manner\nconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n4.\n\nOther Activities Not Limited\nThese Guidelines apply to FBI activities as provided herein and do not limit other\nauthorized activities of the FBI, such as the FBI's responsibilities to conduct\nbackground checks and inquiries concerning applicants and employees under\nfederal personnel security programs, the FBI's maintenance and operation of\nnational criminal records systems and preparation of national crime statistics, and\nthe forensic assistance and administration functions of the FBI Laboratory.\n\n\n\fII.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE GATHERING\n\nThis Part of the Guidelines authorizes the FBI to conduct investigations to detect, obtain\ninformation about, and prevent and protect against federal crimes and threats to the national\nsecurity and to collect foreign intelligence.\nWhen an authorized purpose exists, the focus of activities authorized by this Part may be\nwhatever the circumstances warrant. The subject of such an activity may be, for example, a\nparticular crime or threatened crime; conduct constituting a threat to the national security; an\nindividual, group, or organization that may be involved in criminal or national securitythreatening conduct; or a topical matter of foreign intelligence interest.\nInvestigations may also be undertaken for protective purposes in relation to individuals,\ngroups, or other entities that may be targeted for criminal victimization or acquisition, or for\nterrorist attack or other depredations by the enemies of the United States. For example, the\nparticipation of the FBI in special events management, in relation to public events or other\nactivities whose character may make them attractive targets for terrorist attack, is an authorized\nexercise of the authorities conveyed by these Guidelines. Likewise, FBI counterintelligence\nactivities directed to identifying and securing facilities, personnel, or information that may be\ntargeted for infiltration, recruitment, or acquisition by foreign intelligence services are authorized\nexercises of the authorities conveyed by these Guidelines.\nThe identification and recruitment of human sources - who maybe able to provide or\nobtain information relating to criminal activities, information relating to terrorism, espionage, or\nother threats to the national security, or information relating to matters of foreign intelligence\ninterest - is also critical to the effectiveness of the FBI's law enforcement, national security, and\nintelligence programs, and activities undertaken for this purpose are authorized and encouraged.\nThe scope of authorized activities under this Part is not limited to \"investigation\" in a\nnarrow sense, such as solving particular cases or obtaining evidence for use in particular criminal\nprosecutions. Rather, these activities also provide critical information needed for broader\nanalytic and intelligence purposes to facilitate the solution and prevention of crime, protect the\nnational security, and further foreign intelligence objectives. These purposes include use of the\ninformation in intelligence analysis and planning under Part IV, and dissemination of the\ninformation to other law enforcement, Intelligence Community, and White House agencies under\nPart VI. Information obtained at all stages of investigative activity is accordingly to be retained\nand disseminated for these purposes as provided in these Guidelines, or in FBI policy consistent\nwith these Guidelines, regardless of whether it furthers investigative objectives in a narrower or\nmore immediate sense.\nIn the course of activities under these Guidelines, the FBI may incidentally obtain\ninformation relating to matters outside of its areas of primary investigative responsibility, For\nexample, information relating to violations of state or local law or foreign law may be\n\n\fincidentally obtained in the course of investigating federal crimes or threats to the national\nsecurity or in collecting foreign intelligence. These Guidelines do not bar the acquisition of such\ninformation in the course of authorized investigative activities, the retention of such information,\nor its dissemination as appropriate to the responsible authorities in other agencies or\njurisdictions. Part VI of these Guidelines includes specific authorizations and requirements for\nsharing such information with relevant agencies and officials.\nThis Part authorizes different levels of information gathering activity, which afford the\nFBI flexibility, under appropriate standards and procedures, to adapt the methods utilized and the\ninformation sought to the nature of the matter under investigation and the character of the\ninformation supporting the need for investigation.\nAssessments, authorized by Subpart A of this Part, require an authorized purpose but not\nany particular factual predication. For example, to carry out its central mission of preventing the\ncommission of terrorist acts against the United States and its people, the FBI must proactively\ndraw on available sources of information to identify terrorist threats and activities. It cannot be\ncontent to wait for leads to come in through the actions of others, but rather must be vigilant in\ndetecting terrorist activities to die full extent permitted by law, with an eye towards early\nintervention and prevention of acts of terrorism before they occur. Likewise, in the exercise of\nits protective functions, the FBI is not constrained to wait until information is received indicating\nthat a particular event, activity, or facility has drawn the attention of those who would threaten\nthe national security. Rather, the FBI must take the initiative to secure and protect activities and\nentities whose character may make them attractive targets for terrorism or espionage. The\nproactive investigative authority conveyed in assessments is designed for, and may be utilized by,\nthe FBI in the discharge of these responsibilities. For example, assessments may be conducted as\npart of the FBI's special events management activities.\nMore broadly, detecting and interrupting criminal activities at their early stages, and\npreventing crimes from occurring in the first place, is preferable to allowing criminal plots and\nactivities to come to fruition. Hence, assessments may be undertaken proactively with such\nobjectives as detecting criminal activities; obtaining information on individuals, groups, or\norganizations of possible investigative interest, either because they may be involved in criminal\nor national security-threatening activities or because they may be targeted for attack or\nvictimization by such activities; and identifying and assessing individuals who may have value as\nhuman sources. For example, assessment activities may involve proactively surfing the Internet\nto find publicly accessible websites and services through which recruitment by terrorist\norganizations and promotion of terrorist crimes is openly taking place; through which child\npornography is advertised and traded; through which efforts are made by sexual predators to lure\nchildren for purposes of sexual abuse; or through which fraudulent schemes are perpetrated\nagainst the public.\nThe methods authorized in assessments are generally those of relatively low\nintrusiveness, such as obtaining publicly available information, checking government records,\n\n\fand requesting information from members of the public. These Guidelines do not impose\nsupervisory approval requirements in assessments, given the types of techniques that are\nauthorized at this stage (e.g., perusing the Internet for publicly available information). However,\nFBI policy will prescribe supervisory approval requirements for certain assessments, considering\nsuch matters as the purpose of the assessment and the methods being utilized.\nBeyond the proactive information gathering functions described above, assessments may\nbe used when allegations or other information concerning crimes or threats to the national\nsecurity is received or obtained, and the matter can be checked out or resolved through the\nrelatively non-intrusive methods authorized in assessments. The checking of investigative leads\nin this manner can avoid the need to proceed to more formal levels of investigative activity, if the\nresults of\"an assessment indicate that further investigation is not warranted.\nSubpart B of this Part authorizes a second level of investigative activity, predicated\ninvestigations. The purposes or objectives of predicated investigations are essentially the same\nas those of assessments, but predication as provided in these Guidelines is needed - generally,\nallegations, reports, facts or circumstances indicative of possible criminal or national securitythreatening activity, or the potential for acquiring information responsive to foreign intelligence\nrequirements - and supervisory approval must be obtained, to initiate predicated investigations.\nCorresponding to the stronger predication and approval requirements, all lawful methods may be\nused in predicated investigations. A classified directive provides further specification concerning\ncircumstances supporting certain predicated investigations.\nPredicated investigations that concern federal crimes or threats to the national security are\nsubdivided into preliminary investigations and full investigations. Preliminary investigations\nmay be initiated on the basis of any allegation or information indicative of possible criminal or\nnational security-threatening activity, but more substantial factual predication is required for full\ninvestigations. While time limits are set for the completion of preliminary investigations, full\ninvestigations may be pursued without preset limits on their duration.\nThe final investigative category under this Part of the Guidelines is enterprise\ninvestigations, authorized by Subpart C, which permit a general examination of the structure,\nscope, and nature of certain groups and organizations. Enterprise investigations are a type of full\ninvestigations. Hence, they are subject to the purpose, approval, and predication requirements\nthat apply to full investigations, and all lawful methods may be used in carrying them out. The\ndistinctive characteristic of enterprise investigations is that they concern groups or organizations\nthat may be involved in the most serious criminal or national security threats to the public generally, patterns of racketeering activity, terrorism or other threats to the national security, or\nthe commission of offenses characteristically involved in terrorism as described in 18 U.S.C.\n2332b(g)(5)(B), A broad examination of the characteristics of groups satisfying these criteria is\nauthorized in enterprise investigations, including any relationship of the group to a foreign\npower, its size and composition, its geographic dimensions and finances, its past acts and goals,\nand its capacity for harm.\n\n\fASSESSMENTS\n1.\n\nPurposes\nAssessments maybe carried out to detect, obtain information about, or prevent or\nprotect against federal crimes or threats to the national security or to collect\nforeign intelligence.\n\n2.\n\nApproval\nThe conduct of assessments is subject to any supervisory approval requirements\nprescribed by FBI policy.\n\n3.\n\nAuthorized Activities\nActivities that maybe carried out for the purposes described in paragraph 1. in an\nassessment include;\na.\n\nseeking information, proactively or in response to investigative leads,\nrelating to:\ni.\n\nactivities constituting violations of federal criminal law or threats\nto the national security,\n\nii.\n\nthe involvement or role of individuals, groups, or organizations in\nsuch activities; or\n\niii.\n\nmatters of foreign intelligence interest responsive to foreign\nintelligence requirements;\n\nb.\n\nidentifying and obtaining information about potential targets of or\nvulnerabilities to criminal activities in violation of federal law or threats to\nthe national security;\n\nc.\n\nseeking information to identify potential human sources, assess the\nsuitability, credibility, or value of individuals as human sources, validate\nhuman sources, or maintain the cover or credibility of human sources, who\nmay be able to provide or obtain information relating to criminal activities\nin violation of federal law, threats to the national security, or matters of\nforeign intelligence interest; and\n\nd.\n\nobtaining information to inform or facilitate intelligence analysis and\nplanning as described in Part IV of these Guidelines.\n\n\f4.\n\nAuthorized Methods\nOnly the following methods may be used in assessments:\n\nB.\n\na.\n\nObtain publicly available information.\n\nb.\n\nAccess and examine FBI and other Department of Justice records, and\nobtain information from any FBI or other Department of Justice personnel.\n\nc.\n\nAccess and examine records maintained by, and request information from,\nother federal, state, local, or tribal, or foreign governmental entities or\nagencies.\n\nd.\n\nUse online services and resources (whether nonprofit or commercial).\n\ne.\n\nUse and recruit human sources in conformity with the Attorney General's\nGuidelines Regarding the Use of FBI Confidential Human Sources.\n\nf.\n\nInterview or request information from members of the public and private\nentities.\n\ng.\n\nAccept information voluntarily provided by governmental or private\nentities.\n\nh.\n\nEngage in observation or surveillance not requiring a court order.\n\ni.\n\nGrand jury subpoenas for telephone or electronic mail subscriber\ninformation.\n\nPREDICATED INVESTIGATIONS\n1.\n\nPurposes\nPredicated investigations maybe carried out to detect, obtain information about,\nor prevent or protect against federal crimes or threats to the national security or to\ncollect foreign intelligence.\n\n2.\n\nApproval\nThe initiation of a predicated investigation requires supervisory approval at a level\nor levels specified by FBI policy. A predicated investigation based on paragraph\n3.c. (relating to foreign intelligence) must be approved by a Special Agent in\nCharge or by an FBI Headquarters official as provided in such policy.\n\n\f3.\n\nCircumstances Warranting Investigation\nA predicated investigation may be initiated on the basis of any of the following\ncircumstances:\n\n4.\n\na.\n\nAn activity constituting a federal crime or a threat to the national security\nhas or may have occurred, is or may be occurring, or will or may occur and\nthe investigation may obtain information relating to the activity or the\ninvolvement or role of an individual, gr oup, or organization in such\nactivity,\n\nb.\n\nAn individual, group, organization, entity, information, property, or\nactivity is or may be a target of attack, victimization, acquisition,\ninfiltration, or recruitment in connection with criminal activity in violation\nof federal law or a threat to the national security and the investigation may\nobtain information that would help to protect against such activity or\nthreat.\n\nc.\n\nThe investigation may obtain foreign intelligence that is responsive to a\nforeign intelligence requirement.\n\nPreliminary and Full Investigations\nA predicated investigation relating to a federal crime or threat to the national\nsecurity may be conducted as a preliminary investigation or a full investigation. A\npredicated investigation that is based solely on the authority to collect foreign\nintelligence may be conducted only as a full investigation.\na.\n\nPreliminary investigations\ni.\n\nPredication Required for Preliminary Investigations\nA preliminary investigation may be initiated on the basis of\ninformation or an allegation indicating the existence of a\ncircumstance described in paragraph 3.a.-.b.\n\n11.\n\nDuration of Preliminary Investigations\nA preliminary investigation must be concluded within six months\nof its initiation, which may be extended by up to six months by the\nSpecial Agent in Charge.

If the investigation concerns a threat to the national\nsecurity, an official of the National Security Division must be notified.\nThe notice shall identify all sensitive investigative matters involved in the\ninvestigation.\n\nb.\n\nThe FBI shall notify the National Security Division of:\n\nc.\n\ni.\n\nthe initiation of any full investigation of a United States person\nrelating to a threat to the national security; and\n\nii.\n\nthe initiation of any full investigation that is based on paragraph\n3.c. (relating to foreign intelligence),\n\nThe notifications under subparagraphs a. and b. shall be made as soon as\npracticable, but no later than 30 days after the initiation of an\ninvestigation.\n\n\fd.\n\nC.\n\nThe FBI shall notify the Deputy Attorney General if FBI Headquarters\ndisapproves a field office's initiation of a predicated investigation relating\nto a threat to the national security on the ground that the predication for the\ninvestigation is insufficient.\n\nENTERPRISE INVESTIGATIONS\n1.\n\nDefinition\nA full investigation of a group or organization maybe initiated as an enterprise\ninvestigation if there is an articulable factual basis for the investigation that\nreasonably indicates that the group or organization may have engaged or may be\nengaged in, or may have or may be engaged in planning or preparation or\nprovision of support for:\n\n2.\n\na.\n\na pattern of racketeering activity as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1961(5);\n\nb.\n\ninternational terrorism or other threat to the national security;\n\nc.\n\ndomestic terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(5) involving a violation\nof federal criminal law;\n\nd.\n\nfurthering political or social goals wholly or in part through activities that\ninvolve force or violence and a violation of federal criminal law; or\n\ne.\n\nan offense described in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B) or 18 U.S.C. 43.\n\nScope\nThe information sought in an enterprise investigation may include a general\nexamination of the structure, scope, and nature of the group or organization\nincluding: its relationship, if any, to a foreign power; the identity and relationship\nof its members, employees, or other persons who may be acting in furtherance of\nits objectives; its finances and resources; its geographical dimensions; and its past\nand future activities and goals.\n\n3.\n\nNotice and Reporting Requirements\na.\n\nThe responsible Department of Justice component for the purpose of\nnotification and reports in enterprise investigations is the National Security\nDivision, except that, for the purpose of notifications and reports in an\nenterprise investigation relating to a pattern of racketeering activity that\ndoes not involve an offense or offenses described in 18 U.S.C.\n2332b(g)(5)(B), the responsible Department of Justice component is the\n\n\fOrganized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division.\nb.\n\nAn FBI field office shall notify FBI Headquarters of the initiation by the\nfield office of an enterprise investigation.\n\nc.\n\nThe FBI shall notify the National Security Division or the Organized\nCrime and Racketeering Section of the initiation of an enterprise\ninvestigation, whether by a field office or by FBI Headquarters, and the\ncomponent so notified shall notify the Attorney General and the Deputy\nAttorney General, The FBI shall also notify any relevant United States\nAttorney's Office, except that any investigation within the scope of Part\nVT.D.l.d of these Guidelines (relating to counterintelligence\ninvestigations) is to be treated as provided in that provision. Notifications\nby the FBI under this subparagraph shall be provided as soon as\npracticable, but no later than 30 days after the initiation of the\ninvestigation.\n\nd.\n\nThe Assistant Attorney General for National Security or the Chief of the\nOrganized Crime and Racketeering Section, as appropriate, may at any\ntime request the FBI to provide a report on the status of an enterprise\ninvestigation and the FBI will provide such reports as requested.\n\n\n\fIII.\n\nASSISTANCE TO OTHER AGENCIES\n\nThe FBI is authorized to provide investigative assistance to other federal, state, local, or\ntribal, or foreign agencies as provided in this Part.\nThe investigative assistance authorized by this Part is often concerned with the same\nobjectives as those identified in Part II of these Guidelines - investigating federal crimes and\nthreats to the national security, and collecting foreign intelligence. In some cases, however,\ninvestigative assistance to other agencies is legally authorized for purposes other than those\nidentified in Part II, such as assistance in certain contexts to state or local agencies in the\ninvestigation of crimes under state or local law, see 28 U.S.C. 540, 540A, 540B, and assistance\nto foreign agencies in the investigation of foreign law violations pursuant to international\nagreements. Investigative assistance for such legally authorized purposes is permitted under this\nPart, even if it is not for purposes identified as grounds for investigation under Part H\nThe authorities provided by this Part are cumulative to Part II and do not limit the FBI's\ninvestigative activities under Part n.

In the case\no f signals intelligence (SIG IN T ). the expectation is that surveillance o f targeted electronic\nsignals and system s will yield insight th at’s worth the costly capabilities and operations needed\nto obtain it. For over 50 years, from W orld W ar II through the global w ar on terrorism , this\ninvestm ent has been justified, but the m ission is still rightly judged by the answ ers it delivers.\nThe im plied business model is to position the m ission to cover enough priority targets to ensure a\nsteady stream o f valued products and services for decision m akers and other SIG IN T consum ers.\n(U ) T his strategic plan seeks to m aintain or enhance the m ission’s value in light o f the challenges\nand opportunities o f the unfolding network age. It fram es and establishes several key aim s\nand assigns responsibility' for actions needed to attain them. At the highest level, success is\ndefined as stable o r im proved responsiveness to custom er needs, while doing best against the\ntargets that m atter m ost and avoiding strategic surprise.1\n(U ) The plan w as developed\nand partners, w orking within\nsmall set o f acts that should\nprogress, spot problem s, and\nw e prepare for, perform , and\n\nthrough the on-line collaboration o f over 250 SIG IN T practitioners\na fram ework created by the c h ie f SIG IN T strategist. It focuses on a\npay large dividends, and introduces data-driven processes to track\nprom pt adjustm ents. It’s how w e’ll continue to m odernize the way\nappraise SIG IN T operations in a w orld in transform ation.\n\n(U) DRIVERS\n(S//R E L ) Since 2003 the intelligence community' has been guided by a national intelligence\npriorities fram ew ork (N IPF) that m aps custom er needs into bands (A . B. and C ) o f successively\nlow er concern. “Band A” topics include those str ategic, asym m etric, and other threats that have\nthe potential to greatly harm the U.S. o r its interests W ithin each topic, a 1-5 priority is assigned\nto specific geopolitical or non-state entities o f interest, w ith I being the highest. O f course, not\nall intelligence questions are necessarily best, or even reasonably, probed by SIG IN T means.\nPotential custom ers are asked to request SIG IN T only w hen they can characterize its expected\ncontribution as supplementary , substantial, key. or extraordinary.\n(S/7REL) Since O ctober o f 2005, a national intelligence strategy' has provided additional\ndirection. Its five overarching m ission objectives are to defeat terrorism , prevent and counter the\nspread o f w eapons o f m ass destruction, bolster the grow th o f dem ocracy, penetrate hard targets,\nand anticipate developm ents o f strategic concern. O f course, neither these nor the roster o f\n“Band A ” topics represent a radical shift from prior thinking. For several years, the SIG IN T\nsystem has pursued these issues, intensifying efforts to harvest data from com puters. Internet\ntraffic, and other packetized com m unications in the process. As the chart show s, there has in\n(U ) A s ou tlin ed in A p p en d ix A . e n d -to -en d perform ance w ill b e ju d g e d b y q u an titativ e an d q u alita tiv e\nan aly sis o f cu sto m er requests a n d m issio n deliverables, a n d by au thoritative c u sto m er surveys.\n\nTO P SEC R E T//C O M IN T//R E L TO U S A , FVEY//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP S E C R E T//C O M IN T//R E L TO USA, FVEY//20320108\n\nfact been significant grow th in the percentage o f custom er questions, and especially high priority\nones, that are being at least partially answ ered by serialized SIG IN T reporting.'\n'Band A\" Requests\nquests\n'Band B\" Requests\n'Band C “ Requests\n\nU//FOUO\n0 3 FY 04 FY Q1 FY 02 FY 03 FY Q4 FY Q1 FY Q2FY Q3 FY Q4 FY Q1 FY Q2 FY Q3FY\n2004 2004 2006 2005 2005 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006 2007 2007 2007\n\n,\n\ninsular regim es often\nrem ains at a prem ium , as is inform ation about asym m etric threats such as w eapons o f mass\ndestruction, hostile cybcr activities, and som e terrorist organizations. M oreover, past gains arc\nalw ays under pressure from the relentless evolution o f targets and technology.\n(TS//SI//R E L) For instance, as Internet routing and sendee nodes becom e m ore dispersed, som e\nlucrative SIG IN T chokepoints vanish and it takes m ore access points o r ovcr-the-nct operations\nto m aintain the sam e coverage. As strong cryptography is applied to identity m anagem ent,\nsoftware attestation, protecting data at rest, and securing netw ork m etadata, w e m ust com parably\nexpand cryptographic enabling, sensitive com m ercial partnerships, and cryptanalytic processing\ncapabilities. As users becom e m ore m obile and m ore anonym ous, we m ust introduce new\nassociation and pattern detection technology, lest targets o f interest be lost o r overlooked.\n(S//SLVREL) At the sam e tim e, global m odernization m akes intelligence on econom ic, political,\nand other civil issues m ore valuable, and relevant targets tend to favor netw orks. Internet-centric\nactivities such as e-com m erce, e-voting, and on-net industrial and utility control beg to be m ined,\neven as we expand existing operations against both public and private nets. M ounting interest in\ncyber security and the on-line aspects o f crim e and extrem ism also spur dem and for network\nsurveillance, as well as m ore interaction w ith atypical custom ers such as state and local\ngovernm ents, and tighter partnerships w ith consum ers whose own target know ledge can help\nsteer and interpret collection or whose operations can be “cued” by SIGINT.\n(S//R EL ) Som e efforts to recruit, train, and direct Islamic and other extrem ists are already\nentrusted to netw orks, and so will be m any plans and acts o f the PRC as it rises to be a near-peer\ncom petitor. R uling institutions o f even rogue states m ake som e use o f Internet technology, as do\nthe scientists and proliferators with which they w ork. In fact, few er and few er targets o f any\nstripe o r location are far rem oved from a colleague, confidant, or confederate that’s in the know'\nand on the net.\n\n(U ) \"Q u estio n s” a rc d efin ed here a s d esired essential elem en ts o f in fo rm atio n sp ecified in stan d in g\nC O M I N T o r F IS IN T requirem ents.

This is the essence o f w hat we accom plish for the Am erican people, w hether w e 're\nsupporting the global w ar on terrorism , infiltrating the leadership circles o f strategic rivals or\nrogue states, o r anticipating geopolitical and target technology trends.\n(U //FO U O ) O u r vision, or aspiration, is to utterly m aster the foreign intelligence im plications o f\nnetw orks and netw ork technology. Even conservative people and institutions find them selves\nhaving to entrust their plans and operations to netw orks or else so limit their ability to acquire\ninform ation, issue instructions, and m ove people, m oney, m ateriel, and ideas as to risk\nirrelevance. The m ission m ust be planned, equipped, and executed for best effect, against the\nobjectives that m atter m ost, in this brave new digital world.\n(U ) At the heart o f the task is the need to sense, and m ake sense of, system s, traffic, users, and\nvarious ty pes and levels o f organizations. This is a circular and fast m oving process. New\ninsight leads to better sensing, which leads to still greater insight, and so on - som etim es in\nm onths, but som etim es in m inutes.\n(S//SI//R E L ) Today, m ost o f what we access goes unexplored or unexploited. Hum ans can\nneither follow netw ork flow s in real-tim e nor forge intelligence gold from an accum ulation o f\nisolated data points w hose w orth is only apparent w hen com bined with one another and with\nwhat others may know. O ur global sensors need to be able to think for them selves and talk to\none another instantaneously. O ur processing system s need to autom atically find m eaning in and\nacross vast and dispersed data sets. O u r analysts need new skills and new tools, and need to\napply them in new w ays, often in concert with custom ers. O ur business processes need to\nprom ote data-driven decision-m aking and m ore disciplined end-to-end planning.\n(U ) T his will not happen w ithout leadership and the courage to ask i f the practices and structures\nthat serve us well today will continue to do so in the future. At the sam e tim e, som e im m utable\nvalues m ust continue to influence our daily choices and behavior. All military' and civilian\nem ployees are called to com m it to law fulness, honesty, integrity, fairness, accountability,\nloyalty, collaboration, innovation, and learning.

Som e o f our adversaries w ill say or do any thing to advance\ntheir cause; w e will not. All em ployees m ust have uncom prom ising devotion to personal and\ninstitutional integrity doing the right thing, every tim e, regardless o f how difficult it is.\n\nr\n\n(U ) SIG IN T professionals m ust be honest w ith them selves, colleagues, superiors, and\noverseers. W hen som ething w o n 't w ork, isn 't w orking, h a sn 't worked, o r went wrong, we\nneed to say so, w ith respect, but also w ith unm istakable clarity. W e then find a different way\nforward.\n\n'r (U ) SIG IN T professionals need to grow and prosper as m ission assets and as individuals.\nW e encourage career-long learning, periodic stretch assignm ents, and a balance between\nw ork and hom e life that honors duty to family, com m unity, and s e lf as well as to country.\n\nTO P SEC R E T//C O M IN T//R E L TO U S A , FVEY//20320108\n\n\n\fTOP S E C R E T//C O M IN T//R E L TO USA, FVEY//20320108\n\n(U) KEY AIMS & ACTIONS\n(U ) W e seek to m axim ize the SIG IN T m issio n 's value to the nation in the context o f the\nintelligence priorities and technological realities o f the netw ork age.

The National Intelligence Priorities Fram ew ork (NIPF) maps\neach F.EI into one o f three bands (A , B. or C ) o f successively decreasing concern according to\ngeneral topic, and assigns a I-5 priority based on the com bination o f the topic and specific\ngeopolitical o r non-state entity involved. Responsive SIG IN T is delivered in several form s, but\nserialized reporting dom inates, and so one indicator o f end-to-end m ission perform ance is the\npercentage o f requested E EIs for which at least som e responsive reporting is provided (i.e., the\n\nEEI citation rate).\n(U//FOUO) A t a m acro-level, the overall citation rate for “Band A” E EIs should be greater than\nthat for “ Band B,” which in turn should exceed that for “Band C ”. Beyond that, perform ance\nagainst each “ Band A” topic is also w eighed in accordance w ith the follow ing first-order rules.\nPerform ance is poor i f a “ Band A” to p ic’s rate doesn’t even exceed the overall “ Band B” rate.\nPerform ance is weak i f a to p ic 's rate is above the overall “ Band B” rate, but less than the overall\n“Band A” rate.

Numerous $2 have complained of its existence, and the relatively\nsmall intelligence value it contains does not justify the sheer volume of collection at MUSCULAR (1/4th ofthe total daily collect).\n\nBackground: Since July of 2012, Yahoo has been transferring entire email accounts using the Narchive data format (a proprietary\nformat for which NSA had to develop custom demultiplexers). To date, we are unsure why these accounts are being transferred \nmovement of individuals, backup of data from overseas servers to US servers, or some other reason. There is no way currently to\npredict if an account will be transferred via Yahoo Narchive.\n\nCurrently, Narchive traffic is collected and forwarded to NSA for memorialization in any quantity only from DS-ZOOB. On any given\nday, Narchive traffic represents 25% (1568) of daily PINWALE content allocation (60GB currently). DS-ZOOB is scheduled\nto be upgraded in the summer of 2013; it is likely that memorialized Narchive traffic, if still present in the environment, will grow\nproportionally double now, to 30 GB/day).\n\nNarchive traffic is mailbox formatted email, meaning unlike Yahoo webmail, any attachments present would be collected as part of\nthe message. This is a distinct advantage. However, it has not been determined what causes an Narchive transfer of an account, so\nthese messages are rarely collected \"live\".\n\n \n\nBased on analysis of Narchive email data and we were able to indentify statistics for the original\n\ncommunications date for Narchive email messages collected:\n\n \n\n30 days 1118 11%\n30 days, 90 days 1758 17%\n90 days 180 days 1302 13%\n180 days, 1 year 2592 26%\n1years, 5 years 3084 31%\n5years 154 \n\nNumerous target offices have complained about this collection \"diluting\" their workflow. One argument for keeping it is that it\nprovides a retrospective look at target activity this argument is hampered by a) the unreliable and non-understood nature of when\nthe transfer occurs for an account, and b) that FISA restrospective collection would retrieve the exact same data \"on demand?.\n\nSSO Optimization believes that while this is \"valid\" collection of content, the sheer volume and the age coupled with the\nunpredictable nature of Narchive activity makes collecting older data a less desirable use of valuable resources. 59% of Narchive\nemail collected was originally sent and received more than 180 days after collection. This represents about 8.9 GB a day of \"less\ndesirable? collection long term allocation that could be easily filled with more timely, useful Fl from this lucrative 550 site. As\nalways with our optimization, the data would still be available at the site store for SIGDEV. This would not impact metadata\nextraction.\n\nPast DO volume reduction efforts:\nWebmail OAB- Leap day 2012: the original defeat only targeted gmail, yahoo, and hotmail webmail protocol\nFB buddylist sampling since last year\n\nToday: FB OAB this is a JSON addressbook\n\n",

It is a direct\nresult of the activities and findings from the Large Access Exploitation\n(LAE) Working Group. Optimization activities can be categorized as:\nimpacting primarily content collection, i.e., feeding repositories like\nPINWALE and PRESSUREWAVE; metadata, perhaps better termed\n\"structured data,\" collection, i.e., primarily feeding repositories like\nMARINA or MAINWAY; or both.\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) An examination into the content collected by\nSSO sites in the fall of 2011 revealed that a significant portion of collection\nwas repetitive, better placed into metadata repositories, or of little foreign\nintelligence value. Rapidly changing internet protocols, imprecise targeting\nmethods, and constantly shifting target technology use means that selectors\nor traffic seen by tasking today may not be the same tomorrow. In addition,\nseveral emerging technologies in use by targets or contacts of targets have\nprotocols which can cause gross over-collection and selector detasking, e.g.,\nYahoo! Webmessenger, which cannot be prevented under UTT tasking, as\nthe protocol contains the precise selector tasked.\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) The SSO Optimization team's job is to identify\nthese types of data, and ensure appropriate corrective action is taken,\nthrottling the data from corporate content or metadata repositories, as\nappropriate.\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Implementation details for specific SSO sites\ncan be found on the SSO Collection Optimization NOFORN wiki page.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\f[edit] (U) Address Books\n(U) Reason for Optimizing\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Ownerless address books can account for 22%\n2012), are highly repetitive, and can be both numerous and large.\nAdditionally, the data is highly structured, so they are better parsed and\nanalyzed in structured repositories like MARINA.\n(U) Criteria (SCISSORS)\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) To alleviate the large number of ownerless\naddress books currently being collected, address books will be blocked at\nSCISSORS. SCISSORS will process each flow and label sessions with the\ncategory of 8223 where they meet the following criteria:\n• (Yahoo|Gmail|Hotmail)-viewAddressBook (which represents ~90% of all\naddressbook collection)\n• APMSGTYPE IS PRESENT\n• NO APACTIVEUSER\n• SIGAD = Given SIGADS (currently, four)\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) The sessions that do not meet the above criteria\nwill send metadata to FALLOUT, but the sessions will be dropped before\nreaching PINWALE. Metrics for category 8223 will not be available in\nYELLOWSTONE, and these volumes will not count against PINWALE site\ncaps set by the CSRC.\n(U) Criteria (XKEYSCORE)\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Because of how inefficient the SCISSORS\nimplementation of ownerless address book throttles is (essentially requiring\nthat SCISSORS process all of the selected content from the affected\ndataflows twice), work is underway to implement the same throttle in\nXKEYSCORE at site. This requires a software modification to allow certain\ntypes of ownerless buddy list metadata to be created at site (vs at\nSCISSORS, under the current architecture). Then a deployed XKEYSCORE\nfingerprint will block the content while allowing the metadata to be\nmemorialized.\n\n\fXKS Versions:\nXKS Version 1.5.8 v89 TU Version 1.5.7 v151\nDigester Labeling:\n<HASBUDDY>true</HASBUDDY>\n<ANONADDRBOOK>true</ANONADDRBOOK>\nThe following fingerprint labels and defeats the traffic.\ndefeat/atxks/ownerless_addressbook\n(U) Deployment Date\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) The SCISSORS ownerless address book throttle\nwas implemented on 2/29/2012 for one site, and for others in March and\nApril of 2012.\n(TS//SI//REL USA, FVEY) The XKEYSCORE ownerless address book\nthrottle is under development.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[edit] (U) Yahoo Webmessenger\n(U) Reason for Optimizing\n(S//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Yahoo's web-based Messenger client sends\nfrequent requests, and receives frequent responses, for inbox and buddy\nstatus which are highly repetitive and contain little or no useful FI\ninformation in the actual message content beyond the simple fact that the\nuser was online. During the first two weeks of December, at least eight\nselectors were detasked by CSRC due to excessive collection (exceeding\nsession limits).\n(U) Criteria\n\n\f(S//SI//REL USA, FVEY) Yahoo Webmessenger is identified as either being\na request for status message from the client (uncommon), or a status\nmessage (common):\n• request\n1. HTTP GET /v1/pushchannel/\n2. 'x-yahoo-msgr-user-agent: YahooMessenger'\n3. http_host('rest-notify.msg.yahoo.com')\n4. http_url('&msgrAppId=' and '&sid=')\n• status\n1. 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8'\n2. Message contains: '\"@pendingMsg\" : 0, \"@syncStatus\" : 0, \"responses\" :\n[ {'\n(U) Deployment Date\n(S//SI//REL USA, FVEY) /atrouter/ on 11 Jan 2012. /atxks/ on 17 April\n2012.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n• This page was last modified on 7 January 2013, at 18:59.\n\n\f",

Originally sponsored by the US Naval Research\nLaboratory, and now backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, it routes a user’s\ntraffic through several servers in a way that hides the user’s location.\n(TS//SI) We have seen several targets using Tor. Our goal was to analyze Tor\nsource code and determine any vulnerabilities in the system. We set up an internal\nTor network to analyze Tor traffic, in the hopes of discovering ways to passively\nidentify it. We also worked to create a custom Tor client which allows the user finer\ncontrol.\n\nContents\n1 (U) Tor overview\n\n\n2 (U//FOUO) Objectives\n\n\n3 (U//FOUO) Objectives 1 and 2\n\n\n4 (U//FOUO)

Its creators use a special jargon\nto describe its workings; please consult appendix A, Tor glossary, for definitions. Tor’s\nanonymization works by having a Tor client send its traffic through a circuit of three\nservers, each running Tor, under several layers of encryption. This accomplishes several\nthings. Most basically, the Tor servers, many of which are listed on publicly advertised\ndirectory servers, are chosen to act as a series of proxies. This may seem to be excessively\ncomplex, as a single proxy server can be used to hide one’s location, but a single-hop proxy\nis vulnerable in two ways. First, by analyzing the pattern of the traffic going to and from\nthe proxy server, it is possible to deduce which clients are making which requests. Second,\nif an attacker owns the proxy server, then it certainly knows who is asking for what, and\nanonymization is ruined. By using multiple hops, Tor is much more resistant to both of\nthese attacks. Traffic analysis becomes extraordinarily difficult, as it must be coordinated\nacross several machines, and an attacker must own all the hops along the circuit in order\nto trace requests back to the originating client.\n(U) If Tor’s only feature was the use multiple proxies, it would not necessarily mean\nthat it could not be attacked some way, such as knowing which circuit a client will choose to\nroute traffic through, or simply reading requests sent in the clear and looking for identifying\ninformation. However, Tor leverages the OpenSSL cryptographic libraries to encrypt the\ndata it sends and to choose random circuits in order to prevent an attacker from gaining\nuseful information.\n(U) The series of Tor servers used to relay a client’s TCP traffic is referred to as a\ncircuit. Circuits are set up one server at a time in a way that keeps any single server from\nknowing the entire layout of the circuit. The client connects to the first server. It then\nasks the first server to connect to the second server. Finally, it sends a request through\nthe first server that asks the second server connect to the third server. Each server only\nknows who connected to it and to whom it connected, which is just one server each way\nin the circuit. A more detailed explanation can be found in appendix B.1.\n(U) The phrase “onion routing” refers to the way that encryption is layered to hide\ninformation sent down the circuit. When setting up the circuit, the client negotiates keys\nwith each of the servers it will be routing through. Most circuits in Tor contain three\nservers, so the client negotiates three secret keys, one with each server. When the client\nwants to send some data, for example an HTTP GET request, it first encrypts the data\nonce using each key. It sends the packet to the first server, which removes one layer of\nencryption and passes along the packet to the second server. The second server removes\nanother layer of encryption and sends the packet to the third server. When the third server\nremoves a layer of encryption, then the packet is now in the clear, and the server will send\nthe HTTP GET to the appropriate destination. In this way, only the third server can see\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nwhat the client is sending, and to anyone outside of the Tor cloud it appears that the third\nnode originated the request.\n(U) In short, Tor uses a combination of encryption and multiple proxies to hide who\nis sending what through the Tor cloud.\n\n\n(U//FOUO) Objectives\n1. (U//FOUO) Become familiar with Tor by setting up an internal Tor network.\n2. (U//FOUO) Read the documentation and code of, as well as examine the packets\nsent and received by, the client.\n3. (S//SI) Develop detailed client specifications and requirements and document them\nfor the community.\n4. (S//SI) Create Tor client libraries to be leveraged by a network-enabled application.\n5. (S//SI) Create a Tor client, using the above Tor libraries, that allows for on-the-fly\ntweaking of the client’s behavior in the Tor cloud.\n\n(U//FOUO) We feel that we accomplished all of these objectives, as well as a few\nother unspecified goals. This paper discusses our progress on all of these objectives.\n\n\n(U//FOUO) Objectives 1 and 2\n\n(S//SI) We set up our own internal Tor network on eight machines in the Protocol Exploitation lab. The network consisted of two directory servers, five servers, and 1 machine\nthat was configured to act only as a client. They were connected to each other through\nthe same hub, and we used Ethereal to sniff packets that they sent back and forth.\n(U//FOUO) Tor is a large open-source project, and we were able to download its\nsource code and documentation from tor.eff.org. Most of our analysis was performed using\nsource code from Tor versions 0.1.1.17 and 0.1.1.21. There were no major differences\nbetween the two versions, and the core functionality of building circuits and maintaining\ninter-server connections remained unchanged.\n(U//FOUO) Our analysis was three-fold: we read the protocol specification, examined the source code, and observed the actual behavior of our own Tor cloud. This gave\nus an excellent idea of how Tor works, allowing us to formulate hypotheses regarding Tor’s\nbehavior which we could then immediately test.\n\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR\n\n(TS//SI) Another major objective was the specification and development of a custom Tor\nclient library. We developed a library that allows the programmer control over all aspects\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof building a circuit and sending data. Our library is as portable as Tor itself, and we have\nsuccessfully compiled and tested it on both Windows and Linux. We named the library\nMJOLNIR, which is the name of Thor’s hammer from Norse mythology.\n(TS//SI) MJOLNIR is a modification of Tor, and it is ideally indistinguishable from\nan original Tor client. As such, it should appear identical to Tor in traffic. To ease this\nprocess, we used original Tor functions whenever possible. However, its main purpose is\nto provide the programmer with greater control over all aspects of Tor. In the normal Tor\nclient, almost all servers in all circuits chosen randomly. Using MJOLNIR, the programmer\ncan build circuits one server at a time, with no limit to the number of servers in the circuit.\nThen the programmer can send an arbitrary TCP payload across the circuit that he built\nand process the response however he wishes.\n(TS//SI) All of MJOLNIR’s most important calls (in setting up a circuit as well\nas sending data) are blocking. This is because the Tor code is inextricably linked with\nlibevent, an open-source library that allows the user to set up signals that can be handled\nwhenever they are needed. Whereas Tor uses events and a function called once per second\nto perform all its necessary checks and corrections, MJOLNIR uses libevent internally so\nthat each function does what it should do before returning control to the calling program.\nIt would be unfair to any programmer to require that any program using MJOLNIR should\nalso be forced to use libevent at the same level that Tor does. We felt that having blocking\ncalls was the lesser of two evils in this situation, as only programs that follow Tor’s structure\ncould possibly find libevent a viable way of controlling program flow. MJOLNIR’s solution\nof using libevent internally does make the program slower, but allows the programmer to\nknow whether all of his requests succeed or fail immediately upon return to his program.\n\n4.1\n\n(U//FOUO) Building circuits\n\n(TS//SI) The most fundamental portion of MJOLNIR is its capability to build arbitrary\ncircuits of any length. Using our library, a programmer can build a circuit, use it for some\ntraffic, then extend it and continue using it. Like Tor, MJOLNIR allows multiple circuits\nto be active at one time, and the user can send traffic along any of them.\n(TS//SI) In order to build a circuit, the client must have information about some\nof the servers in the Tor cloud. This information is kept on the directory servers and\ntheir mirrors, and to get this information the client must request it specifically from the\ndirectory. MJOLNIR provides a function, update router descriptors, which automates\nthis process. Once MJOLNIR has the directory, it can build circuits to any of the servers\nthat it knows about. Servers that have middleman-only exit policies are still allowed to\nbe at the end of the circuit as it is being built. However, should the calling program want\ndata to travel across the circuit, it must be using an exit node that will allow traffic to\nexit to where the program wants it to go, or MJOLNIR will refuse to send the traffic in\nthe first place.\n(TS//SI) In order to build a circuit, the programmer must begin with a call to\nMJOLNIR’s function new arbitrary circuit by nickname, which returns a new circuit t structure with the given server as its first node. MJOLNIR also provides a set\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof functions that will append another server to a given circuit. There is also a function\nthat will return a random circuit of a given length, which is provided both in order to\nretain some of Tor’s original functionality and to ease the process of constructing a circuit.\nMJOLNIR is designed to provide as much flexibility as possible, providing the programmer\nwith a wide array of options for building and extending circuits.\n(TS//SI) In an effort to provide a robust suite of functions, MJOLNIR provides\nerror-checking at many different levels of circuit construction. Tor servers will fail when\nasked to connect to themselves, but that error will not become apparent until data is\nsent across the circuit. To avoid this problem, MJOLNIR will watch what servers are\nadded to the circuit, and it will refuse to add a server if it is currently at the end of the\ncircuit. In this case, the circuit is not destroyed, but there is at least one situation in\nwhich attempting to add a circuit will result in the destruction of the entire circuit. If the\nprogram attempts to connect to a server that has gone down since being added, then the\ncircuit will be destroyed. This is initiated by the end of the circuit rather than the client,\nso we have no control over it. The calling program should always check return values to\nensure that circuit constructions and extensions were successful.\n\n4.2\n\n(U//FOUO) Sending and receiving data\n\n(TS//SI) MJOLNIR would not be useful if it could not communicate with other computers.\nFortunately, Tor makes it easy for MJOLNIR to send and receive data without relying on\nan outside program. To send data, MJOLNIR must have three things: a message, a\ndestination, and a circuit across which to send the message. Presumably, the first two\nare application dependent, while the circuit is easy enough to build using MJOLNIR’s\nfunctions. Once a circuit is built and a message is ready to be sent, the programmer needs\nto call send payload down circ with the correct arguments, and the message should get\nto the destination. Each new payload creates a new application proxy (AP) connection,\nwhich is only used internally. Normally, outside applications (e.g. a web browser) send\ntheir messages across Tor using AP connections. Instead of creating AP connections when\nit gets a request from another program, MJOLNIR creates an AP connection when it has\nsomething to send across a circuit.\n(TS//SI) Before the message is sent, MJOLNIR sets up libevent events so that it can\nsuccessfully read and write across that connection. It uses the write event immediately\nwhen it sends a payload. It must still listen for a response before returning control to the\ncalling program. In order to provide a reasonable amount of time to receive a response,\nMJOLNIR uses a timeout scheme modeled on TCP timeouts. If MJOLNIR does not\nreceive a response before the timeout runs down, then it will shut down the connections\nit is waiting on and return to the calling program.\n(TS//SI) Theoretically, there should be a way to shut down connections more elegantly than using timeouts. For example, consider if MJOLNIR shut down a connection\nwhen it received a cell that was less than the maximum length. Initially, this seems like a\ngood idea because Tor servers should minimize the number of packets they send by sending maximal-length payloads whenever possible. However, upon inspection of the packets,\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 1: (TS//SI) The basic GUI window showing (clockwise from top left)\ncircuits, available servers, and circuit contents.\nservers do not always send maximal-length cells, so this method does not work. Also, as\nfar as Tor is concerned, there is no difference between a cell at the beginning of a message\nand a cell at the end, so there is no easy way to know that a message is complete without\nparsing the payload.\n(TS//SI) Once MJOLNIR receives a cell, it calls a user-set function,\npayload read handler. This is a pointer to a function that takes a string (the payload) and its length. Unfortunately, due to the problems described above, there is no way\nto handle an entire response if it comes in more than one cell; each cell is handled individually. However, by setting this variable (see the API in the appendix), the calling program\ncan do any operation on the incoming cells, thereby parsing out any necessary data. The\nflexibility afforded by this arrangement is largely what makes MJOLNIR’s communication\ncapabilities so useful.\n\n4.3\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR GUI for Windows\n\n(TS//SI) In addition to porting the MJOLNIR library to Windows in a dynamic link\nlibrary (DLL), we created a graphical user interface (GUI) to implement a custom Tor\nclient for Windows.\n(TS//SI) In its current state, the Windows version of MJOLNIR has the following\ncapabilities:\n• Creating new circuits.\n• Appending a node to an already existing circuit.\n• Creating random circuits of arbitrary length.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n• Performing “coil” and “flower” attacks on servers.\n• Appending “coils” and “flowers” to existing circuits.\n• Sending arbitrary packets through a circuit.\n(U//FOUO) See appendix F for detailed information on the Windows version of\nMJOLNIR.\n\n\n(S//SI) Tor’s X.509 certificates\n\n(S//SI) The only part of a normal Tor interaction that does not take place under TLS\nencryption is the TLS handshake, which has to be done in the clear. We chose to focus on\nthis traffic to see if there was any way to identify Tor traffic, since all traffic under TLS\nencryption looks the same.\n(U) Tor creates two X.509 certificates shortly after starting up, in the function\ntor tls context new. The first certificate contains a short-term connection key, and\nis signed by the machine’s public RSA key (its identity key). The second is a self-signed\ncertificate containing the identity key.\n(U) A typical Tor X.509 certificate is shown in table 1.\n(S//SI) The string “TOR” appears in the organizationName of both the subject\nand issuer portions of the X.509 certificates. This means that we see this string in the\nclear during the TLS handshake. By also taking advantage of the ASN.1 encoding that\nsurrounds the string in the certificate, we were able to find a byte sequence that appears\nin every Tor TLS handshake. This makes collection easy, as we simply look for the byte\nsequence in traffic. See table 2 for the sequences.\n\n5.1\n\n(S//SI) MJOLNIR’s X.509 certificates\n\n(TS//SI) When a Tor server receives a certificate, it will verify that its peer sent it a\ncertificate with all of the required fields for X.509 certificates and that its subject’s commonName field exists and is alphanumeric. Tor servers will not reject a certificate with a\nperiod in them, but they will generate a log message to the effect that someone who is not\nusing Tor is trying to connect to the machine. It does not check that the organizationName\nfor either subject or issuer is “TOR,” and it does not check to see that the “<identity>”\nstring is ever present. Because of this, MJOLNIR can easily send a certificate with false\nor random information and still connect to the Tor cloud.\n(TS//SI) To send a falsified certificate, MJOLNIR just needs an array of field/value\npairs, where the field is the field name of the X.509 certificate (e.g. commonName, organizationName, countryCode), and the value is the corresponding value of the field (e.g.\n“mjolnir”, “pantheon.se”, “SE”). As long as the field/value pair is valid, MJOLNIR will\nput it into the certificate, so that anyone watching traffic will not immediately realize that\nthe traffic from a machine using MJOLNIR is Tor traffic.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nTable 1: (U) Tor’s X.509 certificate\n• Version: 3 (0x2) This is hard-coded into Tor.\n• Serial Number: some number Currently, we don’t know if this is a random\nnumber, or if there is some significance. (We do know that it is created with an\nOpenSSL function.)\n• SignatureAlgorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption\n• Issuer: O=TOR CN=string <identity> “TOR” will always be present as the\norganizationName.

Note that it will always be followed by “ <identity>”.\n• Validity:\n– Not Before: time This is the time that the TLS certificate was created by\nTOR.\n– Not After: time By default, this is 2 hours later.\n• Subject: O=TOR CN=string Again, “TOR” is the organizationName.

This ensures that even if the programmer\nforgets to give a certificate to the program, there will be no identifying information in the\nTLS handshake.\n\n\n(U) Tor’s hidden services\n\n(U) Tor allows machines to offer a TCP service without revealing their IP address, using\nthe same anonymization techniques as clients connected to the network. Such services\ncan only be connected to through the Tor network, and are accessed by special .onion\naddresses resolved by Tor directory servers. This offers several benefits to the operator of\nthe service. Such a service can be hosted from behind a firewall or NAT, and any attackers\nattempting to perform a distributed-denial-of-service attack will be stymied because they\ndo not know the machine’s IP address. For details on the hidden service protocols, see\nappendix C.\n(S//SI) Currently, there are roughly 50 publicly advertised hidden services. This\nnumber seems low. Given Tor’s rising popularity it seems likely that more than 50 hidden\nservices exist. The ability to locate hidden services is important, as only then will we be\nable to police and/or exploit them. Unfortunately, we were not able to find any good way to\ndiscover a new hidden service or to find where a known hidden service is hosted. For more\ndiscussion, see sections 7.2.2, Locating known hidden services and 7.3, Discovering\nunknown hidden services.\n\n\n(U//FOUO) Possible attacks\n\n(TS//SI) This portion of the paper will be devoted to several possible attacks related to\nTor. Their application is mostly speculative, as we have not implemented any of them\nexcept for the MJOLNIR-related attacks, and we have not attempted any of them outside\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof the lab. These descriptions are intended to be used as possible avenues for future\nresearch and development.\n\n7.1\n\n(TS//SI) Denial-of-service-style attacks with MJOLNIR\n\n(TS//SI) An unmodified Tor client will never include a given server in a circuit more than\nonce. This ensures that no server will have to do more work than any other. However,\nonly the client can check for repeated servers. With MJOLNIR we can build an arbitrary\ncircuit of arbitrary length, violating nearly all restrictions on circuit construction with\nimpunity. This capability allows for many interesting DoS-style attacks as we can force\nother server to do many times the work we have to. Since Tor normally sends packets of\nlength 586, large circuits can heavily tax the Tor cloud in general, and a targeted server\nin particular.\n(TS//SI) The biggest problem with these attacks is that they take us a large amount\nof work to set up. For an n-server circuit, we must send at least n cells to set up that\ncircuit. Building a circuit can take a large amount of time, especially if the servers are on\ndifferent continents, as is the case in the Tor cloud. The number of packets generated is\non the order of n2 , and the time to set up a circuit grows similarly. Once the circuit is set\nup, the amount of traffic grows linearly with the number of servers on the circuit.\n(TS//SI) The point of building these circuits is to get target servers to handle much\nmore traffic than our client machine while not disturbing the rest of the Tor cloud. Once\nthe circuit is set up, this is not a problem. For example, if we set up a circuit in which one\nserver appears 50 times, it will always do at least 50 times more work than our machine\nonce the circuit is established. We can use this for two distinct types of attack.\n(TS//SI) First, there is the possibility that if we had enough circuits running through\na target machine, we could cause a socket denial of service. Each connection between two\nTor servers uses distinct sockets. Once two machines are connected to each other, they\nwill always use the same sockets, but with enough machines connecting to a server, it is\ntheoretically possible to cause a machine to use all of its available sockets.\n(TS//SI) Also, Tor gives servers the option of sending only a limited amount of traffic\nthrough the Tor network in a given period (day, week, or month). By targeting a machine\nwith these attacks, we could cause a server to hibernate, essentially taking it out of the\nTor cloud until the next accounting period begins. This could also make bandwidth costs\nprohibitively high for targets.\n7.1.1\n\n(TS//SI) Coil attack\n\n(TS//SI) Our first implemented technique for achieving either type of attack is what we\ncall the “coil” attack. For this attack, we choose two target servers and set up a circuit that\nbounces back and forth between the two, “coiling” them around each other. When we set\nup a circuit of nc coils, the circuit will actually be composed of 2nc servers. This is because\nfor each coil both targets are included once. This attack is concentrated, but requires two\ntargets in order to work. This may be detected by an observant sysadmin, but by default,\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nTor’s logs do not store IP addresses, so the information would have to come from elsewhere.\nEven given the necessary IP information, the system administrator will see only the other\ntarget sending and receiving large quantities of information. Without further investigation\nand some creative thinking, it is highly likely that the system administrator will assume\nour other target is actually launching the DoS attack. We can leverage the anonymity\nprovided by Tor to protect ourselves from easy detection by simply appending this coil\nonto the end of a circuit.\n7.1.2\n\n(TS//SI) Flower attack\n\n(TS//SI) Our second implemented technique for achieving a DoS attack is what we call the\n“flower” attack, and it targets only one server. In this attack, MJOLNIR builds a circuit\nto a random server, then to the target, then another random one, then the target, and so\non for a specified number of “petals.” When we set up a flower with np petals, the circuit\nwill actually be composed of 2np servers. The flower attack distributes most of the load\namongst the machines of the Tor cloud, so at most the target server will suspect that it is\nbeing attacked. But even if the target knows about an attack, it will have to assume that\nsomeone is trying a distributed denial-of-service attack. While the system administrator\nwill likely recognize that his attacker(s) are leveraging Tor, Tor’s strong anonymity will\nleave him with few options. He will be forced to accept it or reduce/eliminate Tor usage\nof his machine.\n(TS//SI) Perhaps the most serious flaw with the flower attack is that administrators\non the petals might notice that their Tor traffic is coming from and going to the same\nserver, a violation of Tor’s protocol which clearly requires a custom client. However, the\npetals still would not have enough information to know where the request originated, and\nany attempt to discover this would necessarily break the anonymity of Tor. In order to get\naround this, we could build a petal with two servers between the instances of the target\nserver. In this way, no server realizes that it is taking part in an attack.\n\n7.2\n\n(U//FOUO) Traffic analysis\n\n(S//SI) Is there a way to undo the anonymity that Tor provides? It does not appear that\nTor leaks any significant information about the client to anyone other than the client.\nHowever, it is still possible to analyze the pattern of traffic in and out of the Tor cloud to\ntry to determine which clients are responsible for which requests. Tor does not make such\nan attack (here referred to as a correlation attack) easy.\n7.2.1\n\n(U) A basic Tor circuit\n\n(U) The most common activity in Tor is carried out across circuits 3 nodes long. A client\nconnects to a first server, which connects to a second server, which connects to a third\nserver, which connects to the desired web page or other service.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(TS//SI) For this scenario, we are most interested in tracing a request back to the\nclient, assuming that we see an exit node connect to something we deem interesting. The\nworst (and most likely) case is that we will not own any of the servers along the way.\nThere are two types of potential correlation attacks, although both are complex.\n(S//SI) First method: circuit tracing This method requires data on all of the\nconnections for each server in the attacked circuit. While currently unrealistic in general,\nthis is a potentially powerful attack. A small, private Tor network, for example, could\npossibly be completely compromised by this technique.\n(U//FOUO) We also need to have a good idea of how long it takes to send data\nacross the network to another machine. This comes with the usual caveats that network\ncongestion, distance between links, and packet size affect transmission time. Although in\ntheory Tor packets are all the same size owing to the fixed cell size, in practice we see\ndifferent packet sizes, as two or more cells sometimes get sent in the same packet. Despite\nthis, we should have a good idea of the network latency. Actual processing time devoted\nto the cells is minimal, and can be ignored.\n(S//SI) We begin by focusing on an exit node making a connection to material of\ninterest. At this point, we must keep track of all of the connections that node has up.\nWhen the exit node receives data, it will send it back down the circuit that requested\nit. Thus data comes in to the exit node, and then the node will send out data over the\nappropriate connection.\n(S//SI) Unfortunately, the exit node will almost certainly be sending data out over\nseveral connections. We must keep track of all of them. Let the network latency be x\nseconds. When we see data get sent to the exit node, we only need to pay attention to\nthe outgoing connections that send out data roughly x seconds later. We must take into\naccount some error in our timing, to allow for differences in latency owing to differences\nin network conditions. We then make a list of all of the nodes in the Tor cloud that the\nexit server sends data to. These are all potential second nodes.\n(S//SI) The above process must be recursively performed on the list of potential\nsecond nodes. Hopefully this number of nodes will not be prohibitive, but we have no\nhard data about how many nodes a given machine in the Tor cloud is simultaneously\nconnected and actively sending data to. Again, we will use the timing to determine which\nconnections are of interest. This is made slightly easier by the fact that no node will appear\ntwice in a circuit, meaning that we can ignore any outgoing connections from our possible\nsecond nodes to our exit server. We can also ignore any connections made to machines\noutside of the Tor cloud (i.e. clients) because the second server should only be talking to\nother Tor servers. Now we have an even larger list of nodes to look at, and these are our\npossible entry servers.\n(S//SI) Finally, we look at the outgoing connections from the entry servers that are\nsending out information roughly x seconds after the possible second nodes. This is made\neasier by the fact that we are really only interested in connections into the Tor cloud from\noutside of the Tor cloud, so we can ignore any connections made to other Tor servers. So\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nnow, we have a large list of potential circuits.\n(S//SI) From here, we watch for more interesting material to be sent to the exit\nserver and repeat the process. We should get a different set of potential circuits, as not\nevery connection should be active again at roughly the same time except the connections\nalong the circuit for which we are looking. There should be some overlap between the two\nlists. This intersection is our new, smaller list of potential circuits. After repeating this\nprocess enough times, we should only have one circuit, or at most, a handful.\n(TS//SI) This analysis becomes easier for each box that we own along the circuit,\nsince we then know for sure which incoming connection matches which outgoing connection\non that box. This means that our tree of potential circuits branches one less time. Owning\nthe exit server is probably most useful for this type of analysis, since it is the only machine\nknown to be a part of the circuit from the beginning.\n(TS//SI) There are some difficulties. How many potential circuits will result from\neach iteration? Without some data on the real Tor cloud regarding how many connections\neach server is sending data over for a given span of time, it is impossible to say. It would\nnot be surprising if this number turns out to be very, very large, even with the pruning at\neach step. Assuming the number of potential circuits is not too large to work with, how\nmany iterations of this algorithm will it be necessary to run before we can track down the\none, true circuit? Again, without some real data about the Tor cloud it is impossible to\nsay. Clearly, the more potential circuits we find at each iteration, the more iterations it\nwill take to narrow the list down to one.\n(U//FOUO) The biggest problem with this idea is that Tor will only use a circuit\nfor a short period of time before tearing down and building a new one. Currently, the\ndefault period of time for this is 10 minutes, and Tor checks every 30 seconds to see if any\ncircuits need torn down. So at best there are 10 minutes during which one can perform\nthis analysis.\n(TS//SI) Second method: Black-box the Tor cloud In order for this attack to\nwork, we only need to see connections entering and exiting the Tor cloud. When we see\nan exit server make a request of a service that we are interested in, we keep track of when\ninformation is sent back into the Tor cloud. We then keep track of each client connected\nto the Tor cloud that receives data afterward for an arbitrary amount of time, probably\na TCP timeout. This will likely be an enormous number of clients. Each client will have\na certain probability of being the one that made the request; for example, a client that\nreceives information 2 seconds after the service sends back some data is more likely to\nbe the one that requested it than a client that receives information 10 seconds after the\nservice sends the data. Each time we see the service send information back to that same\nexit server, we track which clients receive data during the right time frame. Each iteration\nwill give us a large number of clients, but we are only interested in the clients that receive\ninformation each time, that is, clients in the intersection of all the sets. The client making\nthe requests must be in that intersection. The client with the highest total probability\nover all the iterations is the most likely to be the target.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(TS//SI) This technique is essentially a wide-scale version of the circuit-tracing technique, and is less precise. However, it should be easier to collect this information, as there\nare currently only around 450 publicly known exit servers, and it is easier to watch connections from 450 machines to the outside of the Tor cloud than it is to watch all connections\nof all machines, as the circuit-tracing method requires. The hope is that the large amount\nof data we could collect for this method would compensate for its less precise nature.\n7.2.2\n\n(S//SI) Locating known hidden services\n\n(S//SI) In the case of a hidden service, the most likely scenario is that we know about\na hidden service and to want to know where (i.e. on what machine) it is located. We\nwould use a Tor client and connect to the hidden service in order to set up a circuit. See\nappendix C for a description of hidden service circuits. For a normal hidden service circuit,\ncircuit tracing would have to stretch across a circuit containing five servers, making it too\ncomplex, and we can not use the Tor black box approach. Things must be done somewhat\ndifferently.\n(TS//SI) If we know the rendezvous point (RP), the analysis becomes more manageable. We can set a preferred RP using the configuration file of even a basic Tor client.\nThis will work for our purposes, but if we do that, then we will be using a normal Tor\nserver as a RP, meaning that it will have several connections through it at a given time.\nIf we program a custom client to choose an arbitrary RP, perhaps even making the client\nbox the RP (see section 8.1), then we can choose a RP outside of the Tor cloud, meaning\nthat the only connections through it will be ones related to the hidden service. For this\nattack, assume that we know the RP, as well as the server that it is connected to for this\ncircuit.\n(S//SI) When the client makes a request, it will go to the RP, which will send it\ndown another circuit to the hidden service. This gives us a chance to to see what node\nthe RP is connected to (call it the first node). Then, we check the timing in the same\nmanner as in the basic Tor circuit to see to which servers it is connected. We can ignore\nany connections that go outside of the Tor cloud. We now have a list of potential second\nnodes. In a similar fashion, we check the timing of all of these to see to which servers they\nare connected. One of these is the hidden service.\n(S//SI) The hidden service will respond, so we will see data come back up the circuit\nto the RP. This gives us another chance to work with the timing to try and figure out\nthe circuit. It would be easiest to figure out the second node during this step. One would\nhave to see which machines are talking to the first node just before it talks to our RP, and\ncorrelate that list with our possible second nodes from when the request was sent down\nthe circuit. The actual second node should be in the intersection of these two lists.\n(S//SI) As with the normal Tor circuit, this will likely give us many potential circuits,\nand need to be iterated several times before the hidden service is located. There are two\nmain advantages over the same analysis for a normal Tor circuit. The first is that there\nare fewer servers between the RP and the hidden service, meaning that we only need to\nkeep track of two possible branches in the circuit, instead of three. The second is that we\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ncan ask the hidden service to connect to the RP as many times as we want, whenever we\nwant. This allows us to perform the correlation over and over again, albeit with different\ncircuits each time. The more data we have, the more likely we are to locate the hidden\nservice.\n(S//SI) We know that the hidden service will never build a circuit to the RP that\ncontains the hidden service machine, although it can be its own RP. Thus, whatever\nmachine the hidden service is on will never be the machine that connects to the RP. Every\ntime we ask the hidden service to build a circuit to the RP, we keep track of which machines\nare connecting to the RP. Eventually there will be a sizable list of machines that cannot be\nthe hidden service. It is doubtful that we will narrow it all the way down to the machine\non which the hidden service is located, but it will help us prune the possible branches from\npossible second nodes.\n(S//SI) The hidden service may have a list of nodes that it will never use in a circuit\n(under ExcludeNodes in the configuration file); these will never show up as the machine\nthat connects to the RP. It will, however, use a server listed under ExcludeNodes as an RP.\nAlso, the hidden service may have set up one or more entry guards for its circuits, meaning\nthat the first node from the hidden service (the second node in the above example) will\nalways be one of those routers. If it has only set up one entry guard, that machine will\nalso never be the one that connects to the rendezvous point. This is unlikely, because most\nof the time one sets up multiple entry guards. A fixed first node effectively shortens your\ncircuit by one hop. So this analysis may turn up the hidden service’s excluded nodes and\nentry guards even if it does not locate the hidden service.\n\n7.3\n\n(S//SI) Discovering unknown hidden services\n\n(S//SI) We did not discover any method to detect previously unknown hidden services.\nIf a hidden service is being offered on a machine that is also a Tor server, there may be\nsome noticeable difference between its traffic and that of a typical Tor server. However, a\nhidden service may be offered on a machine outside of the Tor cloud.\n(S//SI) In our time in the lab, we found that running an nmap on a node that is\noffering a hidden service will turn up the port that the hidden service is using to deal with\nincoming connections. It can then be directly connected to, outside of Tor.\n(TS//SI) There are several issues with this. We must already suspect the machine\nof housing a hidden service to decide to do the nmap, or alternately, nmap several servers\nin the hopes of turning up a hidden service. Then, the machine running the hidden service\nwill likely have several ports open, and there is no way to tell which port is offering a\nhidden service just by looking at the list of open ports. A hidden service may even be\noffered on a well-known port such as port 80. We would have to try to connect to each of\nthe ports we see open on a machine to determine if there is a hidden service being run. We\nwould not even know which protocol the hidden service is running. It may be an HTTP\nserver, an FTP server, an SMTP server, etc. The only thing we know is that the protocol\nmust run over TCP. It is not enough to attempt to connect once to each port, using an\nHTTP GET request. Several protocols must be tried.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(S//SI) Also, keep in mind that the people running these hidden services are generally very careful, and all of these requests and nmaps are detectable by a canny system\nadministrator. We can hide ourselves by using Tor to route our requests, even if we don’t\ntry to access the hidden service the Tor way, but the attempt may well be detected. This,\ncombined with the shot-in-the-dark nature of the whole enterprise, limits its usefulness.\n\n7.4\n\n(U//FOUO) Man-in-the-middle attack\n\n(TS//SI) Because Tor’s X.509 certificates are self-signed, it may be possible to perform\na man-in-the-middle attack using MJOLNIR to forge certificates. Assume that we wish\nto intercept traffic between two Tor servers with the nicknames Alice and Bob. They\nwill send X.509 certificates that are structured in a very specific way; see section 5. We\ncan use MJOLNIR to create our own Tor-style X.509 certificate with “Alice” or “Bob”\nin the correct location and appear to be the other machine. From here, we carry out a\nman-in-the-middle attack in the normal fashion.\n(TS//SI) However, this only allows us to get under the layer of TLS encryption.\nAs covered in section B.3.2, the client sets up a layer of encryption with the server (for\nexample, Bob) by passing it an “onion skin”. Most of the time, this is done using a\nCREATE cell which contains half of a Diffie-Hellman handshake. The contents of this\nCREATE cell are encrypted to Bob’s publicly advertised RSA key. This means that we\nwon’t be able to read the CREATE cell, and we still won’t be able to read the contents\nof the cells that go through the man-in-the-middle. All we will be able to see is 3 bytes of\nheader on the cells that we would relay through.\n(TS//SI) If the man-in-the-middle intercepts a CREATE FAST cell, it will be able\nto read the X value that it contains and create a shared secret with the client, in effect\nbecoming the first server in the circuit. The intended first server can be completely removed\nfrom the circuit, and the man-in-the-middle will see which server is second in the client’s\ncircuit.\n(TS//SI) We did not test this in our work, so there may be issues with this attack\nthat we did not foresee. At the very least, there is still the obstacle of the authoritative\ndirectory servers. They act in a fashion similar to a trusted third party. The directory\nlisting weakly associates specific RSA public keys with specific server nicknames. If a\nserver operator registers their Tor server with the authoritative directory server (this must\nbe done out-of-band), then this becomes a strong association, and certificates with Alice’s\nname will not be accepted unless they have Alice’s listed public key. Thus, it may not\nalways be possible to perform this attack. However, the authoritative directory servers\nappear vulnerable. See section 8.4 for further discussion.\n\n\n(U) Future areas of study\n\n(TS//SI) There are still many interesting and important areas of Tor functionality to explore. As with any software project, there are always bugs to fix and features to add. There\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nare also two major avenues of exploration in the architecture of Tor itself that warrant\nfurther study because they may provide ways to discover important target information.\n\n8.1\n\n(U//FOUO) Expanding MJOLNIR’s functionality\n\n(TS//SI) The Tor code provided a solid basis for our work on MJOLNIR, but every\nmodification opens up the opportunity for bugs to arise. All of our work was done in a\nsmall lab with eight machines, so the MJOLNIR code must be tested on a larger network\nto see if it still behaves correctly, or if its response time is simply too long to be useful.\nThere remain large portions of code that are only useful to servers that can safely be cut\nfrom the MJOLNIR main code. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to completely\ndivorce the client and server sides of Tor’s code.\n(TS//SI) MJOLNIR still has one major deficiency: it cannot connect to hidden\nservices. In order to successfully connect to one, the client must set up a circuit to a\nrendezvous point, then to an introduction point, then must request that the hidden service\nmeet it at the rendezvous point. Doing this much is very important, and with the right\nmodifications, it becomes possible to have a client be its own rendezvous point. As such,\nthere will be only two servers between our client and the hidden service, making a traffic\nanalysis attack easier, which may open the way for locating the identity and location of\nhidden services.\n\n8.2\n\n(U) Privoxy\n\n(U//FOUO) Tor is useful only for rerouting traffic so that one’s location and/or browsing\nhabits are kept secret. Tor does not examine the packets it sends for identifying information\nsuch as IP addresses. Because of this, Tor is packaged with Privoxy, a free software filtering\nproxy. Privoxy’s purpose is to scrub all identifying information from HTTP requests, etc.\nAny Tor user who is not using a filtering proxy like Privoxy is probably leaking identifying\ninformation, especially in DNS requests. There may be situations in which Privoxy does\nnot hide all of the information that needs to be hidden for perfect anonymity. However,\nwe did not have time to study the interaction between Tor and Privoxy, and it warrants\nsome attention.\n\n8.3\n\n(U) Tor remote control\n\n(TS//SI) One area of interest that we looked at briefly before turning to other, more useful,\nideas was the possibility of using Tor’s control port to control a client or server. Tor offers\nthe option to set up a control port. A control port would allow one to remotely control\nany standard configuration option of his Tor server as if he were directly editing Tor’s\nconfiguration file. However, this did not offer the flexibility or power that we needed to\nset up a custom client, so we abandoned the idea early on. This does not mean that there\nis no useful application of using the control port. For example, one may be able to set up\na carefully selected set of entry guards or exit servers (or both) so that suspected target\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ntraffic will always route through friendly servers. There may be other ways of exploiting\nthe control port, including going so far as to modify the target’s list of trusted directory\nservers. This might send the target client to a directory server in which all of the servers\nare friendly.\n\n8.4\n\n(TS//SI) Directory server exploitation\n\n(TS//SI) It may also be useful to study Tor directory servers in more detail. Our work\nfocused solely on the client, but many attacks would be much easier with access to more\nTor servers. The directory servers ultimately control which Tor servers are used by clients.\nWe have found that a server can put itself on a directory server multiple times; all it takes\nis the server running several Tor processes, each having a different nickname, open port,\nfingerprint, and log file. This only requires different configuration files for the different\nprocesses, which are easy to set up. That machine will handle a disproportionate amount\nof traffic, since it is listed several times. This increases the density of friendly servers in\nthe cloud without increasing the number of servers we have set up. Unfortunately, each\nlisting has the same IP address, which would be very noticeable to anyone who inspecting\nthe directories.\n(TS//SI) A more useful attack would be to fool Tor clients into believing that a\nfriendly box is actually someone else. This could potentially be accomplished by getting\nthe directory servers to list the friendly box as the other machine. That may allow us\nto see more information than the target wants us to see. For example, if we know that\na certain target has a list of preferred entry guards and exit servers, and if we can list\nour machines as those servers, then the target (or second node, respectively) will be very\nlikely to send traffic through our machines, making it easier to correlate the traffic and\ndetermine what the target is requesting and/or where the target is.\n(TS//SI) There may be many other applications of this type of attack, and for this\nreason, directory server exploitation should be looked into.\n\n\n(U) Acknowledgments\n\n(U//FOUO) We would like to thank the CES Summer Program for giving us the opportunity to work on this problem. We would also like to the our mentor,\nfor his\nguidance and help with this problem. Also thanks to the CES Summer Program directors,\nand the other students in the program.

When a client or server builds a circuit, it is\nconnecting to the Tor cloud.\n\nB\nB.1\n\n(U) Programming details\n(U) Building circuits\n\n(U) The most important structure in Tor is the circuit, that is, the list of machines that\na client will send its traffic through. Information regarding this circuit is maintained in\nthe circuit t structure. This structure stores information regarding the connections and\nencryption used by the machine when sending information along the circuit. For the client,\nit also contains a list of the servers along the path and the encryption information to use\nwith each server.\n(U) When a user wants to build a circuit, most of the work happens in the function circuit establish circuit. It is passed five parameters: purpose, need capacity,\nneed uptime, internal, and a pointer to info. These parameters contain information used to\ndetermine several aspects of the circuit that is ultimately built. In particular, info contains\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ninformation for connecting to a specific exit server if one has already been chosen. (This\nonly happens when attempting to access one of Tor’s hidden services; see appendix C\nbelow.) circuit establish circuit is a small function, consisting of only 20 lines. All\nof the real work happens in 4 function calls that it makes.\n(U) First, circuit establish circuit calls circuit init, to which it passes purpose, need uptime, need capacity, and internal. Right away, this function calls another\nfunction, circuit new. This function allocates memory for the circuit t structure, initializes several fields of the structure, calls circuit add to add the new circuit to the\nglobal circuit list, and returns. Back in circuit init, the parameters are used to initialize more fields in the circuit t structure. Next, it sets the state of the circuit to\nCIRCUIT STATE OR WAIT, indicating that it is waiting to establish a connection to the next\nserver in the path before it sends along any packets. Finally, circuit init returns a\npointer to the newly-created circuit t structure.\n(U) Back in circuit establish circuit, the function onion pick cpath exit is\ncalled and passed the pointer to the new circuit t from circuit init and the parameter\ninfo originally passed to circuit establish circuit. onion pick cpath exit starts\nby getting the list of available routers using the function router get routerlist. This\nrouter list is created using information obtained from the directory servers. The process\nis not covered in this paper; see section 8.4.\n(U) Next, the function new route len is called to determine the number of servers\nthat should be in the circuit. This number is based on the purpose of the circuit and\nwhether or not info is NULL, but for most Tor circuits, it will be three. After a number\nhas been decided on, the function count acceptable routers checks how many servers it\nthinks can route traffic. If the number of acceptable routers is less than two, the function\nreturns failure, and no circuit is built. If the number of available routers is two or more,\nbut less then what was decided on, this becomes the length of the circuit.\n(U) One of two things can happen next. If info is not NULL, then the server with that\ninformation will be used as an exit, and the program moves on. Otherwise, the program\npicks a good exit server. This is done in the function choose good exit server, which\ntakes parameters purpose, dir (a router list), need uptime, need capacity, and is internal.\nThree of these are parameters originally sent to circuit establish circuit. There are\ntwo cases, based on the circuit’s purpose. For general purpose circuits, if is internal is set\n(meaning the circuit is intended to be used to connect to a server within the Tor cloud,\nmost likely as a rendezvous point for a hidden service), then the exit server is chosen\nusing router choose random node (see Choosing a hop, section B.1.1). Otherwise,\nchoose good exit server general chooses the exit server. This function takes a list of\nall available exit servers, discards any that are currently unsuitable (for example, those\nservers that are listed as down), and selects from those remaining one that can handle the\nmost pending connections. It then returns the router information necessary to connect to\nthe selected server.\n(U) After initializing the circuit and picking out an exit, the other hops in the circuit\nmust be chosen. To do this, the program calls onion populate cpath. This function\nrepeatedly calls another function, onion extend cpath, until the whole circuit is built. In\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nonion extend cpath, choose good entry server is called to select the first node in the\ncircuit. This takes the entire list of available servers, gets rid of those unsuitable (already\nchosen as the exit, listening on wrong port, etc.), and from the remainder, chooses a\nrandom node using router choose random node.\n(U) For the middle hop, choose good middle server is called. Essentially, this is\nthe same routine as choose good entry server except that it also excludes from the list\nof possible routers those that have already been chosen as other hops in the circuit.\n(U) For each hop along the circuit, once a good router is chosen, the choice is returned to the calling function. The router is then appended onto the circuit by calling onion append hop. This function first calls onion append to cpath which adds this\nrouter to the list of routers in the circuit. How does the program keep track of this list?\nOne of the elements of the circuit t structure is cpath, which is actually a pointer to a\ncrypt path t structure. All of the information necessary to connect to each router, including the IP address and cryptovariables between the two machines, can be found in this\nstructure, as well as a few simple bandwidth accounting fields. cpath points to the first\nrouter in the circuit, but it also maintains next and prev members in the crypt path t\nstructure, which, unsurprisingly, point to the next and previous routers in the circuit,\nrespectively. It is important to note that not only is this a doubly linked list, but it is also\ncircular.\n(U) After all three routers in the circuit have been chosen and appended to the\ncircuit, the program returns all the way back to circuit establish circuit and moves\non to the next important step, establishing connections to all of the routers.\nB.1.1\n\n(U) Choosing a server\n\n(U) Most of the time, router choose random node is called to choose which server will be\nused. Despite its name, the choice is not exactly random, and the function is passed several\nparameters to help with its decision. The most important arguments would be the list of\npreferred servers, and the lists of excluded servers. For some reason, two lists of excluded\nservers are passed: a character string containing server nicknames, and a smartlist t\nstructure see below containing server information. The lists do not necessarily overlap.\nSeveral flags indicating user preferences regarding server capacity, uptime, and the like are\nalso passed. One of the arguments, strict, is set if the user will only accept a choice from\ntheir list of preferred servers.\n(U) The function begins by creating a smartlist of the preferred servers, from which\nit removes any excluded servers. It will then call smartlist choose to select a random\nelement of that list.\n(TS//SI) smartlist choose is a very simple function. In Tor, the smartlist t\nstructure is essentially a resizable array, and several functions are provided to manage\nthem. (See appendix E, MJOLNIR API for more on smartlists.) smartlist choose\ngenerates a random index and returns the element of the smartlist with that index. The\nrandom index is generated using the OpenSSL RAND bytes function. Care is taken to\navoid bias in the random numbers, by making sure that the maximum value returned by\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nRAND bytes is a multiple of the size of the smartlist. For example, suppose the size of\nthe array is 10 and RAND bytes could return any value up to 25. Then when computing a\nrandom index for the smartlist, the function would generate a value less than 25 and take\nit mod 10. Because 25 is not a multiple of 10, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 would occur\nmore often than 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n(U) If for some reason no preferred server is chosen (for instance, no preferred servers\nwere specified), two things can happen. If strict is set, the function returns NULL, indicating failure. Otherwise, the program continues by attempting to find servers that meet the\npreferences indicated by the flags. This is done by creating a smartlist containing all running routers that meet the preferences, which is passed to smartlist choose. The only exception\nis\nif\nthe\nparameter\nneed capacity\nis\nset,\nin\nwhich\ncase\nrouterlist sl choose by bandwidth is called, which makes its random choice slightly\ndifferently.\n(U) routerlist sl choose by bandwidth works differently than smartlist choose.\nFor the given list of servers, it adds up all of the bandwidths. At the same time, it creates\na separate smartlist of each server’s bandwidth. For example if the first three servers can\nhandle 200 bytes/s, 450 bytes/s, and 1000 bytes/s respectively, then the smartlist will have\nentries 200, 450, and 1000. Then, a random number between 0 and the total bandwidth\nis selected (using the same OpenSSL function as in smartlist choose). It steps through\nthe smartlist of bandwidths, summing the bandwidths, and chooses the first server where\nthe bandwidth sum is greater than the random number. Again returning to the example,\nif the random number was 412, the second server would be chosen, because 200 + 450 =\n650, and 650 > 412. If the number was 70, the first server would be chosen. We see that\nhigher bandwidth servers are more likely to be chosen than lower bandwidth servers, as\none would expect.\n(U) If the function is still unsuccessful in finding an acceptable server, the program\ntries one more time to find a next hop, this time without setting any preferences. This is\nthe last resort; if no server can be found, then the function returns NULL and the circuit\nfails.\n\nB.2\n\n(U) Connecting the circuit\n\n(U) Recall that a client records all of the servers in its circuit using the crypt path t\nstructure. Once it has decided upon a complete circuit, the client must now connect the\nservers in the circuit so they can send information back and forth. In Tor, the connection t structure holds the information needed to set up such a connection, such as the\nIP address of the node it connects to, the port it should connect on, and a lot of other\ninformation. A connection is specified by an id number. Connections and circuits are\nrelated in complex ways. A single connection may be part of several different circuits, and\neach circuit t structure holds information on a previous and next connection (p conn and\nn conn, respectively).\n(U) After all the servers that will make up the circuit have been determined,\ncircuit establish circuit calls circuit handle first hop. First, this function re-\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ntrieves information regarding the first server from the circuit’s cpath variable. This information is used to see if there is already a connection to that server. If so, that connection\nwill be used for the circuit’s n conn. The appropriate fields of the circuit t structure\nare set to hold information about that connection, and circuit send next onion skin\nis called to set up the cryptovariables between the two routers. See B.3, Encryption for\nmore about the information sent in an “onion skin”.\n(U) If there is no pre-existing connection to the first server, the function\nconnection or connect is called. It takes as arguments the address, port, and identity digest of the server being connected to. The identity digest is a SHA-1 hash of the\nserver’s public RSA key, and is often used to uniquely identify a particular router. A lot\nof things happen in this function, with the ultimate goal of returning a fully initialized\nconnection. First, it calls connection new, which allocates memory for a new connection\nand initializes various members of the connection t structure.\n(U) Next, connection or connect calls connection or init conn from address,\nwhich is passed the newly created connection t structure, and the address, port, and\nidentity digest of the server being connected to. It tries to retrieve the server’s information\nbased on its identity digest, which, if found, is used to fill in more variables in n conn. If it\ncould not find the server information, then the function will fill in the necessary information\nitself, occasionally using more generic information than would have been retrieved based\non the identity digest. With all of these things initialized, the function will return to\nconnection or connect.\n(U) The next important step is that connection connect is called. This attempts to\ncreate a non-blocking socket connected to the IP address:port combination it was passed.\nMost of what goes on in here is basic C socket calls. If successful, the connection is added\nto the global connection array, and read and write events for the connection are set up,\nusing libevent. The events on the connection are initially set to be non-reading and nonwriting, but as the program continues, the events will be changed to handle reads and\nwrites.\n(U) Finally, connection or connect will call connection or finished connecting,\nwhich will start the TLS handshake between the two servers. After the TLS handshake completes, the client will send a CREATE cell to set up encryption between itself and the first server. All of this will be discussed in the next section, Encryption.\nSo once connection or finished connecting returns, everything up to and including\ncircuit establish circuit returns.\n(U) At this point, the circuit is still not fully connected. The client has set up\nits connection to the first server, and is waiting for a CREATED cell in response to the\nCREATE cell it just sent. Once a CREATED cell is received, the client and the first\nserver have finished agreeing on their cryptovariables, and can communicate freely under\na layer of encryption. At this point, the client will make an EXTEND cell, which contains\nall of the information necessary to connect to the second server in the circuit as well as\ncryptovariable information for the layer of encryption between the client and the second\nserver, and send it encrypted to the first server.\n(U) The first server will decrypt the cell, and read the information for connect-\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\ning to the second server. If there is already an existing connection between the two\nservers, that connection will be used for communication along this circuit. If not, then\nconnection or connect is called to open a connection between the two; see above. Once a\nconnection is open, the first server packages the cryptovariable information for the second\nhop in a CREATE cell and sends it to the second server. Upon receiving a CREATED\ncell from the second hop, the first server packages the necessary information into an EXTENDED cell, which it sends back to the client.\n(U) This whole process is repeated one more time, as the client sends an encrypted\nEXTEND cell through the first server to the second server, which will send a corresponding\nCREATE cell to the third server. Again, an EXTENDED cell gets sent back to the client\nafter the third server sends back a CREATED cell. Once the client has finished setting up\nthe cryptovariables between itself and the third server, all of the connections in the circuit\nhave been made, and it is considered open. Any applications waiting to send packets\nthrough Tor are notified that there is a new circuit available to use.\n\nB.3\n\n(U) Encryption\n\n(U) Tor packets are sent under several layers of encryption. Each connection between two\nmachines is under TLS encryption. Additionally, each Tor payload is encrypted by the\nclient once for each hop in the circuit, using a symmetric cipher.\n(U) In Tor, all information to set up the symmetric cipher between the client and\nthe servers in the circuit is sent in what is known as an “onion skin”. In a basic Tor\ncircuit, three onion skins are sent from the client, one for each server in the circuit. Each\nserver reads its onion skin, sets up its cryptovariables, and sends back information to the\nclient to allow the two machines to share cryptovariables. In this way, the client gets the\nnecessary information to put its data under one layer of encryption for each server in the\ncircuit. All cells across a typical Tor circuit will be under three layers of encryption when\nit is sent, and each server will strip off one layer. See figure B.3 for a visual representation\nof this process. It is these layers of encryption that give Tor its designation as an “Onion\nRouting Network”. The last server in the circuit will have the cell in the clear and be able\nto pass along the request found inside.\nB.3.1\n\n(U)TLS encryption\n\n(U) Tor’s TLS handshake is carried out in 3 main phases.\nThe function\nconnection or finished connecting (see above, Connecting the circuit) calls\nconnection tls start handshake, which allocates memory for a new Tor TLS context\nand initializes several of its fields, including the socket that will be written to and the\nSSL CTX that will be used for communication. The SSL CTX is initialized at Tor startup,\nand is changed every 2 hours. It is this structure that contains the certificates that are\nused during the TLS handshake, as well as the list of cipher suites to be used. Tor’s certificates are discussed in more detail in section 5, Tor’s X.509 certificates. By default,\nTor supports 2 cipher suites:\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 2: (U//FOUO) Layers of encryption on a normal GET.\nTLS EDH RSA WITH DES 192 CBC3 SHA\nTLS DHE RSA WITH AES 128 CBC SHA (this is preferred)\n(U) Once the TLS context is properly initialized, the TLS handshake continues in\nconnection tls continue handshake, which calls tor tls handshake.\nThis calls\nSSL connect or SSL accept, depending on which side of the handshake this is on. Assuming there are no errors, the program moves on to connection tls finish handshake,\nwhich validates the handshake and extracts the identity key from the certificate. If everything checks out, then the server is considered authenticated and future communications\nwill take place under TLS encryption.\nB.3.2\n\n(U) Onion skins\n\n(U) After the client picks out its circuit and sets up a connection to the first server in the\ncircuit, it will send an onion skin to the first server. This is held in the payload of either\na CREATE or a CREATE FAST cell. What’s the difference? When the client connects\nto the first server, it does so using TLS. This means that it has already authenticated the\nfirst server’s identity and negotiated a key. This allows it to send a CREATE FAST cell,\nwhich does not require an RSA operation nor a Diffie-Hellman operation, since most of\nthe necessary information has already been established. Note that a CREATE FAST cell\ncan only be sent between a client and the first server in the path, because all other servers\nneed to be authenticated, and the client has no TLS connection directly to them. For this\nreason, CREATE cells are sent for all other servers in a circuit.\n(U) CREATE FAST cells are simple. The cell contains only a random X value,\ncreated using Tor’s crypto rand function, which calls the OpenSSL function RAND bytes.\nThe client sends this to the first server in its circuit. When a server receives a CREATE FAST cell, it extracts the X value and calculates a random Y value using crypto rand.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nIt sends the Y value back in a CREATED FAST cell, along with a SHA-1 hash based on\nX|Y , where | denotes concatenation. X|Y is the shared secret and will be used to generate\nthe keys between the two machines. When the client receives the CREATED FAST cell, it\nwill perform the same hash based on X|Y that the first server should have and compare it\nto the value in the cell. If the two values agree, then the keys for communication between\nthe two machines are set up. (see Keys, below.)\n(U) An onion skin in a CREATE cell is more complex. The first 42 bytes are OAEP\npadding, the next 16 bytes are a symmetric key. This is done using OpenSSL calls. The\nlast 128 bytes of payload are the g x value for a Diffie-Hellman handshake. The first 128\nbytes of this cell (which goes up to about halfway through the g x value) are encrypted\nusing the second server’s public RSA key. The rest of the cell is encrypted with AES in\ncounter mode, using the symmetric key from the first half of the cell.\n(U) When a server receives a CREATE cell, it extracts g x , generates a random g y ,\ncomputes the shared secret g xy , and sends back a CREATED cell containing g y as well as\na SHA-1 hash based on g xy . If a machine other than the client gets a CREATED cell (e.g.\nthe first hop receives a CREATED cell from the second hop), it puts the information in\nan EXTENDED cell, and sends it to the client. When the client gets a CREATED cell or\nan EXTENDED cell, it calculates g xy and checks that the accompanying hash is correct.\nThe client uses g xy to set up the keys that will be used when it communicates with that\nnode. Note that this key exchange required expensive RSA and Diffie-Hellman operations,\nin contrast to the simple random number generation of the CREATE FAST exchange.\n(U) Keys (U) When a CREATED or CREATED FAST cell is received, the function\ncircuit finish handshake is called. It will extract the shared secret and use it to create\nkeys for communication. Recall that for a CREATED cell the shared secret is g xy , and for\na CREATED FAST cell the shared secret is X|Y . Denote the shared secret as K0 .\n(U) Regardless of which type of cell is received,\nthe function\ncrypto expand key material is passed the shared secret. It does a series of hashes to get\nK = H(K0 |[00])|H(K0 |[01])|H(K0 |[02])| ..., where | denotes concatenation. This should\nnot include more than 5 hashes (each hash is 20 bytes long). Any extra bytes are ignored.\n(U) The first 20 bytes of K form KH , the handshake digest. This is used to make\nsure the other node’s handshake checks out. The next 20 bytes become Df , the forward\ndigest, and the next 20 bytes become Db , the backward digest. These digests are used for\nintegrity-checking purposes. They seed a hash that is used by machines to to determine\nwhether or not a cell has been decrypted all the way or not. Df is used for client to server\nstreams, and Db is used for server to client streams. The next 16 bytes of K become Kf ,\nand the next 16 bytes of K become Kb . Kf and Kb are the keys used to encrypt and\ndecrypt the streams of data between the two machines. Kf is used for client to server\nstreams, and Kb is used for server to client streams. All other bytes are discarded.\n\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nC\nC.1\n\n(U) Hidden services\n(U) Offering a hidden service\n\n(U) In order to offer a hidden service, the operator of the service (whom we will call\nBob) must first add lines to their Tor configuration file indicating the directory containing\ninformation regarding the hidden service and the port on which the hidden service will\nbe advertised. After Tor starts up with this new configuration file, it will automatically\ngenerate an RSA public/private key pair, and create a .onion address for the service. The\naddress is of the form x.onion, where x is based on the service’s public key. Specifically,\nx is the base-32 encoding of the first 80 bits of the SHA-1 hash of the public key.\n(U) At this point, Tor picks out at least 3 servers in the cloud to act as introduction\npoints. Bob may use the configuration file to specify particular servers that he wants to act\nas intro points, but if he does not, Tor will simply choose a servers randomly. Once the intro\npoints have been decided upon, Bob does two things. He will generate a service descriptor,\nwhich contains information about his public key and how to connect to his introduction\npoints. This service descriptor can be uploaded to the public directory servers, but it\nneed not be if Bob does not wish to have his service publicly known. Bob will also create\ncircuits to his introduction points. Once the circuit is connected, he will send along cells\nwhich contain his public key, a hash based on KH (see Keys, in B.3, Encryption), and\na signature based on that data. These are called RELAY ESTABLISH INTRO cells.\n(U) When an intended introduction point receives the RELAY ESTABLISH INTRO\ncell, it checks that the information is well-formed and correctly signed. If so, it sends a cell\nback to Bob acknowledging that it will act as an introduction point for his hidden service.\nIt also makes note that the circuit on which it received the RELAY ESTABLISH INTRO\ncell will be used when dealing with requests for Bob’s hidden service, and associates it\nwith Bob’s public key.\n(U) When Bob receives acknowledgment from his introduction points, he considers\nthe introduction circuits open, he will advertise his service descriptors to the Tor directory\nservers if he so desires, and he is now ready to receive requests to access the hidden service.\n\nC.2\n\n(U) Accessing a hidden service\n\n(U) There are several ways that a client (whom we will call Alice) can become aware of\nBob’s hidden service. At the very least, she must receive Bob’s public key somehow, most\nlikely through some out-of-band communication such as a phone conversation or encrypted\ne-mail. Using this, she can request Bob’s service descriptor from the Tor directory servers\nif Bob has chosen to advertise his service publicly. Otherwise, Alice must know Bob’s\nentire service descriptor through some other means.\n(U) Once Alice has the descriptor and decides to talk to Bob’s hidden service, she\nmust first set up a circuit to some server in the Tor cloud, known as a rendezvous point\n(RP). This point is chosen randomly, although Alice can add a line to her Tor configuration\nfile that will indicate preferred RPs. Once the circuit is established, Alice sends a RE-\n\n29\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nLAY ESTABLISH RENDEZVOUS cell to the RP, which contains a randomly generated\nnumber referred to as a rendezvous cookie (RC).\n(U) When the RP receives the RELAY ESTABLISH RENDEZVOUS cell, it will\nsend an acknowledgment back to Alice, and make note that the circuit the cell came in on\nis to be used for a rendezvous, and is associated with that RC.\n(U) After Alice receives acknowledgment from the RP, she builds a circuit to one of\nthe introduction points listed in Bob’s service descriptor. Once connected, she will send\na RELAY INTRODUCE1 cell to the intro point, which contains a hash of Bob’s public\nkey, as well as information intended for Bob that is encrypted to his public key. When\nthe introduction point sees the RELAY INTRODUCE1 cell, it checks the hash against the\nhashes of the hidden service public keys that it knows and finds the circuit associated with\nthat public key. It then sends the cell (now encapsulated as a RELAY INTRODUCE2\ncell, with the same payload) down that circuit, to Bob. Afterward, it sends Alice acknowledgment that her cell was sent, and Alice will shut down her circuit to the introduction\npoint.\n(U) When Bob receives a RELAY INTRODUCE2 cell, he decrypts it and pulls out\nthe data Alice sent. This includes information for connecting to the RP, the RC, and\nAlice’s half of a Diffie-Hellman handshake, g x . If Bob decides to talk to Alice, he will\ncreate a circuit to the specified RP. Bob sends the RP a RELAY RENDEZVOUS1 cell,\nwhich contains the RC, Bob’s half of the Diffie-Hellman handshake g y , and the KH for his\ninteraction with Alice.\n(U) When the RP receives a RELAY RENDEZVOUS1 cell, it finds the circuit associated with the given RC. It then sends g y and KH in a RELAY RENDEZVOUS2 cell\ndown that circuit to Alice. It makes note of the fact that the circuit from Alice and the\ncircuit from Bob are linked, and zeroes out the RC so no one else can attempt to connect\nto Alice’s circuit.\n(U) Finally, Alice receives the RELAY RENDEZVOUS2 cell and uses it to complete\nthe Diffie-Hellman handshake and initialize the cryptovariables between her and Bob. Now\nAlice and Bob can talk across this newly-formed rendezvous circuit in almost the exact\nsame way as a normal circuit. Neither knows what is on the other side of the RP, so they\ndon’t know where the other person’s machine is located. The content of their messages is\nunder the normal circuit encryption as well as one more layer based on their shared secret.\n\nD\n\n(U) Information at the nodes\n\n(S//SI) It is possible for us to have a friendly computer in the Tor cloud. For example, we\ncan set up a server and advertise it to the Tor directory servers, like all other users. We\nmight compromise another server in the Tor cloud through other means. So how much do\nwe know about the traffic that we are sending and receiving across circuits? Tor does a\ngood job of hiding information about the circuit from all of the nodes in the circuit, in\nmost cases allowing nodes to know only about the machines to which they are directly\nconnected. However, some information is still leaked simply by being a part of the circuit,\n\n30\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nand there are some instances where Tor gives the machines slightly more information than\nis needed. The following section attempts to provide a list of information known by each\nserver (here referred to as a node) along the circuit.\n\nD.1\n\n(U) First node\n\n(U) The first node in the circuit is the only node that knows the location of the machine\noriginating the request. It sets up a circuit t variable with a particular p circ id and\narranges a shared secret with the originating node. (See section B.3.2). When the client\nextends the circuit to the second node, the first node receives an EXTEND cell with the\naddress, port, and identity fingerprint of the second node. It sets up a connection to the\nsecond node and sets n circ id in its circuit t variable with a new circuit ID. The second\nnode will send back a cell containing its half of a Diffie-Hellman handshake (that is, g y ),\nand KH (see Keys in section B.3.2 for an explanation of KH ). After this, the first node\nshould not receive any cells that it will be able to recognize, because the cells will be\nencrypted. In short, the first node knows:\n• The location of the client that connected to it.\n• Cryptovariables used for communication with the client, which allow it to perform\none layer of encryption/decryption on cells to/from the client.\n• The ID of the circuit from which the client is sending information. This is p circ id\nin the first node’s circuit t structure.\n• The location of the second node in the circuit.\n• The ID of the circuit on which it sends information to the second node. This is\nn circ id in the first node’s circuit t structure, and will be different from p circ id.\n• g y in the Diffie-Hellman handshake between the client and the second node, and KH .\n(S//SI) However, a machine may not know that it is the entry node. If the commonName on the X.509 certificate passed during the TLS handshake is “client <identity>”,\nthen it is definitely an entry node, because it is talking directly to the client. This is\nsufficient, but not necessary. If the machine receives a CREATE FAST cell, then it is\nthe entry node, as clients will never send a CREATE FAST cell farther down the circuit.\nThere is an option in the configuration file that can be set so that a Tor client will never\nuse a CREATE FAST cell, and Tor servers will never use them, but this still appears to\nbe the most common way that the entry node is set up. Otherwise, a CREATE cell is\nused. If the node receives a CREATE cell, followed by an EXTEND cell, it may be the\nentry node. The only guarantee for such a pattern is that it is not the exit server, which\nwill never see an EXTEND cell.\n(TS//SI) This knowledge would be useless unless we can induce the client to pick\none of our machines as its entry node. In the configuration file, there is an option called\n\n31\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nEntryNodes, which is a comma-separated list of server nicknames. Any servers on that\nlist will be preferred when choosing an entry node. If the option StrictEntryNodes is true,\nthen only servers from that list can be chosen as entry nodes. If the configuration file can\nbe changed to have a client always use a friendly machine for an entry node, then we can\ndiscover who is using Tor, if not what they are requesting.\n\nD.2\n\n(U) Second node\n\n(U) The second node has the least information of any node in the circuit. It does not know\nwho or where the client is, nor does it know what or where the client is connecting to. It\ndoes know:\n• The location of the machine connected to it.\n• Cryptovariables used for communication with the client, which allow it to perform\none layer of encryption/decryption on cells to/from the client.\n• The ID of the circuit from which the first node is sending information. This is\np circ id in the second node’s circuit t structure, and should be equal to n circ id\nin the first node’s circuit t structure.\n• The location of the third node in the circuit.\n• The ID of the circuit on which it sends information to the third node. This is n circ id\nin the second node’s circuit t structure, and will be different from p circ id.\n• g y in the Diffie-Hellman handshake between the client and the third node, and KH .\n(S//SI) A machine cannot definitely know that it is the second node in a circuit. If\nit receives a CREATE cell followed by an EXTEND cell on the same circuit, then there\nis a good chance it is the second node. However, this same pattern is possible for the first\nnode. Because first nodes often see CREATE FAST cells instead of CREATE cells, it is\nmore likely that if a machine sees such a pattern, it is the second node.\n(TS//SI) It is not possible to induce a client to pick our machine as a second node.\nThe second node is chosen using router choose random node, with no list of preferred\nnodes passed to it. The only possible way is to edit the client’s configuration file so\nthat their list of excluded servers excludes all boxes except friendly ones, but that seems\nunrealistic, since that would probably entail listing hundreds of server nicknames in their\nconfiguration file.\n\nD.3\n\n(U) Third node\n\n(U) The third node is the exit node for a basic Tor circuit. This means that it sees request\nthat the client makes in the clear, which is useful information. The downside is that the\nthird node has no idea who or where the client is. The exit node knows:\n\n32\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n• The location of the machine connected to it.\n• The ID of the circuit from which the second node is sending information. This is\np circ id in the third node’s circuit t structure, and should be equal to n circ id in\nthe second node’s circuit t structure.\n• Cryptovariables shared with the client, which allows it to perform one layer of encryption/decryption on cells to/from the client.\n• The exit node can see the data the client is sending, such as an HTTP request or\nPOST data for a form.\n(S//SI) A machine can know it is the exit node very easily. There are several functions\nonly called by exit nodes, such as connection exit begin conn. There is even a macro,\nCONN IS EDGE that will return true if it is passed an exit connection (or an AP connection,\nwhich only appears at the client side of the circuit).\n(TS//SI) Similar to entry nodes, a client can set up preferred exit nodes in their\ntorrc file. There is an option called ExitNodes that is a comma-separated list of server\nnicknames, and any servers on that list will be preferred when choosing an exit node. If\nthe option StrictExitNodes is true, then only nodes from that list can be chosen as exit\nnodes. So the configuration file can be changed to have a client always come to a friendly\nmachine for an exit server.\n(TS//SI) There is one other way to influence a client to choose a specific machine\nfor the exit. Servers have exit policies, which are lists of types of requests that a server\nwill handle. For example, by default, all servers reject traffic sent to port 25 (SMTP) in\norder to discourage spammers from using Tor’s network to hide their activities. One can\neven set up a server that will reject all exit traffic, and only act as a first or second node.\nSo if we set up a server with a more permissive exit policy than most other machines, we\nwill be chosen more often to handle the sort of traffic that other machines will not allow.\nFor example, if we were to allow connections to port 25, our server would be chosen to\nsend e-mail with higher probability than it would for sending other types of traffic. We\nhave no specific statistics regarding common exit policies, and even if we offer a certain\nexit policy, that doesn’t mean that people will think to try to send such traffic through\nTor. Still, this option is more attractive than altering a client configuration file, because\nit only requires a change on a machine that we own.\n\nD.4\n\n(U) Hidden service nodes\n\n(U) As covered in appendix C, Tor uses special nodes when accessing hidden services.\nD.4.1\n\n(U) Introduction points\n\n(U) The introduction point is the third node in a circuit that starts at the hidden service,\nso it knows the information listed under Third Node above. It is also, briefly, the third\n\n33\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nnode in a circuit coming from the client, but this circuit is shut down as soon as the intro\npoint passes along the hidden service request. In addition, it knows the RSA public key\n(modulus) for the hidden service. This is more information than it needs, because when\nit receives a request to access the hidden service, all that is passed along is a SHA-1 hash\nof the public key, so all the introduction point really needs is that hash. By giving the\nintroduction point the entire public key, Tor is leaking more information than it needs\nto. Of course, the only thing that the public key really gets us is the ability to connect\nto the hidden service, but that is not insignificant. Consider the (small) probability that\na hidden service that we do not know about will select a friendly machine as one of its\nintroduction points, and the usefulness is clear.\n(S//SI) A machine knows that it is an introduction point as soon as it receives an\nESTABLISH INTRO cell, which contains the public key info.\n(TS//SI) The hidden service can select its introduction points in its configuration\nfile through a field called HiddenServiceNodes. By changing that field, we can influence\nthe hidden service to choose our box as its introduction point, but if we are on their box\nalready, there are far more useful things we can do, like obtaining the hidden service’s\nprivate key. If HiddenServiceNodes is empty, then introduction points are picked using\nrouter choose random node.\nD.4.2\n\n(U) Rendezvous points\n\n(TS//SI) Rendezvous points are the most knowledgeable nodes in a hidden service circuit.\nWhen accessing a hidden service, a client must first set up a circuit to a rendezvous point\n(RP). The RP is the third node in this circuit, so it knows all the information a third node\nknows; see above. In addition to this basic third node information, the rendezvous point is\nalso given a “rendezvous cookie”, a random 20-byte number which the RP will use later.\nAfter this circuit is set up, the client requests access to the hidden service through the\nintroduction point (the RP sees none of this), and if the hidden service decides to allow\ncontact, it will set up a circuit to the RP. The RP is the third node in this circuit as well.\nThe hidden service sends a cell down this circuit that contains the rendezvous cookie, g y\nfor a Diffie-Hellman handshake between the hidden service and the client, and KH . Right\nnow, the RP only looks at the rendezvous cookie, but it would require only a trivial change\nto have it store the other values.\n(TS//SI) At the RP, after it decrypts its layer of encryption, the cell is only under\none layer of encryption, based on the shared secret between the hidden service and the\nclient. We can also see g y . This is a far cry from knowing the shared secret, but this is as\nclose to being able to see traffic between the client and hidden service as we can get right\nnow. It is certainly the weakest point of the entire hidden service system.\n(S//SI) A node knows that it is a rendezvous point as soon as it receives a RELAY ESTABLISH RENDEZVOUS cell, which contains the rendezvous cookie, and it\nknows that the hidden service and client are connected across it as soon as it receives a RELAY RENDEZVOUS1 cell from the hidden service and sends a RELAY RENDEZVOUS2\ncell to the client.\n\n34\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(S//SI) Clients can be induced to choose a particular machine as a rendezvous point\nby changing the field RendNodes in their configuration file. If this field is empty, the\nRP will be chosen using router choose random node. Hidden services will connect to\nwhatever rendezvous point the client tells them to, even if that node is normally on their\nlist of excluded nodes, assuming that it decides to communicate with the client.\n\nE\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR API\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR attempts to make accessing Tor functionality simple. Below is an\nAPI describing the most useful functions of MJOLNIR, arranged by topic.\n\nE.1\n\n(U) Initialization\n\n• (U) int tor init (void)\n– Description: This is the main entry point for the Tor client. It must be\ncalled before any Tor services are used.\n– Arguments: None.\n– Return Value: Return 0 on success; return a negative value on failure.\n– Notes: This must be called before any other Tor functions are used. It can\nbe called multiple times without issue.\n• (TS//SI) int init keys (const smartlist t *subject, const smartlist t *issuer)\n– Description: In addition to important crypto initialization, init keys generates X.509 certificates (through internal functions), which the program will\nuse to communicate with the Tor cloud.\n– Arguments: The subject and issuer smartlists. See the documentation in\nthe section on smartlists and certificates.\n– Return Value: Return 0 on success and negative values on failure.\n– Notes: This function must be called in order for the Tor client to have specific\ncertificates. If no commonName field-value pair is passed in, it will generate\na random commonName (10-20 characters long). See the documentation for\nsubject and issuer smartlists.\n• (TS//SI) routerstatus t *set chosen dirserver (const char *nickname, int\nfascistfirewall)\n– Description: Call this with the nickname of any directory server, and then\nwhenever MJOLNIR needs to fetch something, it will use that directory.\n– Arguments:\n\n35\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n1. nickname: the nickname of the chosen directory server. If it is NULL or not\nthe nickname for any valid server, the dirserver will be chosen randomly.\n2. fascistfirewall : set to 1 if MJOLNIR is behind a firewall that will not let\ncertain ports out. See Tor’s man page for more documentation.\n– Return Value: The routerstatus t structure describing the chosen directory\nserver. The return value should be checked to see if it is NULL , indicating an\nerror.\n– Notes: The nickname should be either a trusted directory server (hard-coded\ninto the library) or a directory mirror. In order to download from a mirror,\nMJOLNIR must first know which servers are mirrors, so it will have to make\nat least one request from an authoritative directory.\n• (TS//SI) int update router descriptors (void)\n– Description: Get the router descriptor data from a directory server.\n– Arguments: None.\n– Return Value: 0 on success; negative on failure.\n– Notes: This function must be called every time the program needs to update\nits listing of routers. This must be done at least once before setting up any\ncircuits. It may be done an arbitrarily large number of times throughout the\nlife of the program, but each fetch will generate a sizable amount of traffic to\none directory server.\nWarning : this function will always talk to one of the 5 directory servers hardcoded into config.c:529 (add default trusted dirservers). This behavior\nshould be able to be changed if the chosen directory server is a directory mirror.\nSee documentation for set chosen dirserver.\nWarning : This function is blocking. It will halt program execution until it\neither times out or receives a response. See the timeout documentation.\n• (TS//SI) char *get routerdesc string (void)\n– Description: Return the exact string that the server returns when MJOLNIR\nasks for the directory.\n– Arguments: None.\n– Return Value: A new copy of a string containing all router descriptors as\nreceived from the directory.\n– Notes:\n• (U) routerlist t\nThe definition of routerlist t is in or.h on lines 930-941. The most important field\nis the smartlist routers which is a smartlist of routerinfo t structures. The one part\n\n36\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\nof these that will be used most often is probably the nickname field. Let us assume\nthere is a routerlist named rlist. There are rlist->routers->num used routers\navailable, and to access their nicknames, use rlist->routers->list[i]->nickname.\nAlso see the documentation of SMARTLIST FOREACH.\n• (TS//SI) routerinfo t\nThe function router get routerlist returns a smartlist of routerinfo t structures\n(see above for more details). The most important fields of routerinfo t are nickname and the extend info. Using this library, the programmer should never have to\ndeal directly with the internals of extend info t, and will probably never see it at\nall, but if the programmer want to add to the library, he will need to look over how\nit is used. The best place for a quick example is any of the attack functions detailed\nin controlmod.c.\n• (U) routerlist t *router get routerlist(void)\n– Description: Return the current list of all known routers.\n– Arguments: None.\n– Return Value: The list of all known routers. This list will not be populated\nuntil update router descriptors has run.\n– Notes: See the routerlist t documentation.\n• (TS//SI) void tor cleanup(void)\n– Description: Cleans up before shutting Tor down.\n– Arguments: None.\n– Return Value: None.\n– Notes: This must not be called unless no more Tor connections or services\nare needed. Calling tor init after calling this function does not work yet. It\nseems that the problem with this is actually in shutting down and resetting the\nOpenSSL library.\n\nE.2\n\n(S//SI) Circuit building\n\n• (U) circuit t\nThe only field from this structure that the programmer needs to worry about is\nglobal identifier. This identifier is how the program keeps track of circuits it has\nbuilt, so if a program wants to have multiple circuits up at once, the programmer\nmust keep track of their respective global identifiers or maintain a list of pointers to\nthe actual structures.\n• (TS//SI)\ncircuit t *new arbitrary circuit by nickname (char *\nbegin router nickname)\n\n37\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Description: Begin a new circuit that can be added to at any time so long\nas the following two conditions are met:\n1. The client is not one of the nodes in the circuit.\n2. The same node is not used twice in a row. (It can, however, be used twice\nin the same circuit.)\nNote that the first of these is not checked in code, but in its current state, a\nclient using this library will never be a server, so this will not be an issue.\n– Arguments:\nnew circuit.\n\nbegin router nickname: The nickname of the first hop in the\n\n– Return Value: A pointer to the new circuit.\n– Notes: This function must be called before attempting to append a new hop\nonto a circuit.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established.\n• (TS//SI) int append router by nickname to circuit by id (char *nickname,\nint circ id)\n– Description: This function appends the router with the given nickname to\nthe given circuit. It looks up the circuit by its global identifier.\n– Arguments:\n1. nickname: The nickname of the next hop in the circuit.\n2. circ id : The global identifier of the circuit.\n– Return Value: 0 on success; negative values on failure.\n– Notes:\nMust get the circuit id from a circuit returned by\nnew arbitrary circuit by nickname. If MJOLNIR tries to connect to an\ninvalid router (e.g. if the router is down), the circuit will close.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n• (TS//SI) int append router by nickname to circuit (char *nickname, circuit t\n*circ)\n– Description: Append router with the given nickname to the given circuit.\n– Arguments:\n1. nickname: The nickname of the next hop in the circuit.\n2. circ: The circuit to which MJOLNIR should append a router.\n– Return Value: 0 on success; negative values on failure.\n\n38\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Notes: Must get the circuit from new arbitrary circuit by nickname.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n• (TS//SI) routerinfo t *get random router (routerinfo t *exclude)\n– Description: This function gets a random router from the global router list\nso long as the chosen router is not the excluded one.\n– Arguments: exclude: Gives the programmer the option to exclude a certain\nrouter. It is most useful to exclude the most recently appended router in the\ncircuit, as the circuit dies if it tries to go to the same router twice in a row.\n– Return Value: Returns the routerinfo t for the chosen router. This is\nprobably only useful for extending the current attacks, in which case it would\nbe useful to study those attacks carefully.\n– Notes:\n• (TS//SI) int nickname is known (const char *nickname)\n– Description: This function checks to see that the nickname is a valid one.\n– Arguments:\n\nnickname: a string with the nickname of some router.\n\n– Return Value: Returns 1 if the router is valid; returns 0 otherwise. The\nrouter is valid if the program has routerstatus t information about the router\nwith that nickname.\n– Notes: The program may know about an invalid router. For example, the\nrouter may have been taken down since the router descriptor was fetched. However, when MJOLNIR tries to connect a circuit, it will fail.\n• (TS//SI) void close circuit(circuit t **circ)\n– Description: Given an open circuit, close it, remove it from global circuitlist,\nand de-allocate its memory. circ is NULL on return.\n– Arguments: circ: The circuit to be closed.\n– Return Value: None. However, circ is NULL so it can no longer be used.\n– Notes:\n\nE.3\n\n(U//FOUO) Sending and receiving data\n\n• (TS//SI) int send payload down circ(char *payload, size t payload len char\n*ip addr, int port, circuit t *circ, int force)\n– Description: This function sends a custom packet down the requested circuit\nto the specified address at the specified port.\n39\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Arguments:\n1. payload : the custom payload, e.g. an HTTP GET request.\n2. payload len: length of the payload.\n3. ip addr : the IP address of the ultimate destination in IPv4 form: 192.168.1.1\n(as a string).\n4. port: the destination port.\n5. circ: the circuit across which to send this packet.\n6. force: if true, the function will always try to send a payload. If false, it will\ncheck that the address is reachable with the current exit, and if it is not, it\nwill not send a payload.\n– Return Value: Return 0 on success; negative values on failure. If it refuses\nto send a packet because it was not forced, it returns failure.\n– Notes: It is up to the calling program to check that both the payload and\nIP address:port are valid before calling this function. The payload read handler\nmust be set before this call is made.\nWarning : This call will block program execution until it times out or receives\na response.\n• (TS//SI) payload read handler (function pointer):\nvoid * (*payload read handler) (const char *, int)\n– Description: Function pointer to a user-defined function that gets called\nwhen the client receives a payload in response to its request.\n– Arguments:\n1. const char *: the payload that the client receives in response to its request (what the calling program actually wants to read).\n2. int: length of the payload.\n– Return Value: Must return a void *, so the return value can be anything\nthe programmer wants.\n– Notes: These functions should be defined by the user. To set this variable, call\nset payload read handler (handler). Example functions (print payload\nand do nothing) are given in torm.c.\n(TS//SI) Timeouts. MJOLNIR times out if it does not receive a response in a\ncertain amount of time. On the test LAN, we have it set to .1 s, which is more\nthan enough time. However, due to the slow nature of the Tor cloud, it may be\nnecessary to change the value of the initial timeout estimate. Our timeout follows the TCP-style timeout rules, so once it has started receiving cells, it should\nadjust the timeout on its own. The constants that may need adjusting are in\ntimeout.c. In particular, look at INITIAL EST SEC and INITIAL EST USEC for\nthe number of seconds and microseconds, respectively, before it times out. See\nthe discussion in the section on sending and receiving data.\n\n40\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n• (TS//SI) int router should reach addr (int addr, int port, routerinfo t\n*router)\n– Description: The function checks the router’s exit policy and returns nonzero if the address is reachable and zero if the address is not reachable.\n– Arguments:\n1. addr : the address to reach, as an integer.\n2. port: the port to use at addr.\n3. router : the router to check.\n– Return Value: If addr:port is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\n– Notes:\n• (TS//SI) int router should reach addr string (char *ip addr, int port,\nrouterinfo t *router)\n– Description: This function checks the router’s exit policy and returns nonzero if the address is reachable and zero if the address is not reachable.\n– Arguments:\n1. ip addr : the address to reach, as a string in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx form.\n2. port: the port to use at ip addr.\n3. router : the router to check.\n– Return Value: If the ip addr:port is reachable, it returns 1. If not, it returns\n0.\n– Notes: This function just converts the string address to an integer and calls\nrouter should reach addr.\n• (TS//SI) int circuit should reach addr (int addr, int port, circuit t *circ)\n– Description: MJOLNIR checks the exit policy of the circuit’s exit hop and\nreturns non-zero if the address is reachable or zero if the address is unreachable.\n– Arguments:\n1. addr : the address to reach, as an integer.\n2. port: the port to use at addr.\n3. circ: the circuit want to check.\n– Return Value: If the addr:port is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\n– Notes:\nThis function just grabs the last hop in the circuit calls\nrouter should reach addr.\n• (TS//SI) int circuit should reach addr string (char *ip addr, int port,\ncircuit t *circ)\n41\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Description: MJOLNIR checks the exit policy of the circuit’s exit hop and\nreturns non-zero if the address is reachable or zero if the address is unreachable.\n– Arguments:\n1. ip addr : the address to reach, as a string in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx form.\n2. port: the port to use at ip addr.\n3. circ: the circuit to check.\n– Return Value: If ip addr:port is reachable, returns 1. If not, returns 0.\n– Notes: This function just converts the string address to an integer and calls\ncircuit should reach addr.\n\nE.4\n\n(S//SI) Smartlists and certificate masking\n\n• (U) smartlist t\n(TS//SI) The smartlist t structure contains an array of void *s, the number\nof elements used, and its total capacity. However, the programmer should never\nhave to deal with the internals directly. Instead, he should use smartlist create,\nsmartlist add, and SMARTLIST FOREACH. We use this to define custom X.509 certificates; it is nearly ubiquitous in the rest of the Tor code.\n• (U) smartlist t *smartlist create (void)\n– Description: Allocate and return an empty smartlist.\n– Arguments: None.\n– Return Value: A pointer to the new smartlist.\n– Notes: Any smartlist the programmer wants to use must first be returned by\nthis function.\n• (U) void smartlist add (smartlist t *sl, void *element)\n– Description: Appends an element to the end of the list.\n– Arguments: sl is the smartlist that is receiving the element. It must have\nbeen returned by smartlist create.\n– Return Value: None.\n– Notes: Technically, a smartlist may contain pointers to different kinds of objects, though this is highly unrecommended. Individual elements of the smartlist\nmay be accessed through its list, e.g. sl->list[i].\n• (U) void smartlist remove (smartlist t *sl, void *element)\n– Description: Removes the element from the list.\n\n42\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Arguments: sl is the smartlist that is losing the element. sl must have been\nreturned by smartlist create.\n– Return Value: None.\n– Notes: Preserves the order of any elements before element, but elements after\nit may be rearranged.\n• (TS//SI) SMARTLIST FOREACH (smartlist, type, var, code)\n– Description: SMARTLIST FOREACH is a macro that will run code for every\nelement in a smartlist. All elements of the smartlist must be of the given type.\n– Arguments:\n1. smartlist: The smartlist over which MJOLNIR runs the code.\n2. type: The type of data held by the smartlist.\n3. var : The variable name by which the macro access the elements of the\nsmartlist. The variable does not need to be declared before being used.\n4. code: The code to be executed. If there is more than one statement, it\nshould be in curly braces.\n– Return Value: None.\n– Notes: Remember that this is a macro. If the code is bracketed, it must be\nfollowed the closing brace with a right parenthesis and semicolon.\n• (TS//SI) field value pair t\n(TS//SI) This is a very simple structure containing two strings: a field and a value.\nThese should be allocated and set as any other strings. In the example program, this\nstructure is added to a smartlist so that MJOLNIR can use custom X.509 certificates.\n• (TS//SI) Subject and issuer smartlists (smartlist t)\n(TS//SI) Tor uses self-signed X.509 certificates during its TLS handshake. By default, it sends only commonName (normally the client or server’s nickname) and\norganizationName (normally the string “TOR”) for both subject and issuer, with\nthe only difference being that the issuer common name is followed by the string\n’<identity>’.\n(TS//SI) A Tor server will check for required X.509 fields, but not anything else\nexcept the subject’s commonName, and the only restrictions are that the length is\ngreater than 0 and it consists of alphanumeric characters. (The commonName can\nalso contain a period, but this creates a log message on the other server. Currently,\nMJOLNIR treats the period as an illegal character.) These lists allow the programmer to send any X.509 certificate he wishes, instead of always sending the same ones.\nIf there is no commonName in the subject section, the client will generate a random\nstring of characters 10-20 bytes long to act as the commonName.\n\n43\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n(TS//SI) If the commonName has an illegal character, MJOLNIR will generate a\nrandom one. If MJOLNIR receives as input an invalid X.509 field, it will ignore that\nfield/value pair entirely. In this way, MJOLNIR provides relatively robust X.509\ncertificate generation.\n(TS//SI) The programmer must create two smartlists of field value pair t structures (one each for subject and issuer) where the field variable is the name of the\nfield in the certificate and value is set to the appropriate string. These two smartlists\nmust then be passed to init keys (subject first, issuer second).\n(TS//SI) See the documentation for smartlist t, field value pair t, smartlist add,\nsmartlist create, and init keys.\n\nE.5\n\n(TS//SI) DoS-style attacks\n\n(TS//SI) The purpose of these attacks is not actual DoS per se. These simply do not\ngenerate enough traffic. However, they may be able to generate sufficient traffic to force a\nnode into hibernation, which takes the server out of the Tor cloud until the next hibernation\nperiod begins (could be a day, week, or month).\n• (TS//SI) circuit t *flower attack one router (char *routernick, int num petals)\n– Description: Set up a (D)DoS network attack on one Tor node. The program\nwill create a circuit consisting of random routers alternating with the given\nrouter. This results in the given router doing much more work than the rest of\nthe nodes on the circuit.\n– Arguments:\n1. routernick : the nickname of the router to attack.\n2. num petals: he number of times the attacked router will be in the resultant\ncircuit. Therefore, the circuit will be 2 * num petals long.\n– Return Value:\ncircuit.\n\nA pointer to the circuit t structure of the newly-formed\n\n– Notes: When setting up a circuit with n hops, the client must send n cells\nalong the circuit. So setting up a large circuit can be very time-consuming, as\nwell as expensive with regards to both traffic generated and CPU time used.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established. For even a moderately long circuit, this can\ntake a substantial amount of time.\n• (TS//SI) circuit t *append flower to circuit (char *routernick1,\nint num petals, circuit t *circ)\n– Description: Similar to append coil to circuit, this function appends a\nflower to the end of the given circuit. Using this, MJOLNIR is anonymized by\nthe structure of the Tor cloud.\n44\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Arguments:\n1. routernick1 : The router in the middle of the flower.\n2. num petals: The number of times the middle router appears in the flower.\nSo the flower will be 2 * num petals long.\n3. circ: The original circuit to append the new flower to.\n– Return Value: The circuit with the flower added.\n– Notes: See the flower attack documentation.\n• (TS//SI) circuit t *coil attack two routers(char *routernick1,\nchar *routernick2, int num coils)\n– Description: Similar to the flower attack, except that this function generates\na circuit that bounces back and forth between two nodes in the Tor cloud instead\nof targeting only one router.\n– Arguments:\n1. routernick1 : nickname of the first attacked router.\n2. routernick2 : nickname of the second attacked router; if MJOLNIR sends a\npayload down this circuit, the second router will be the final one.\n3. num coils: the number of times each router will appear in the circuit. So\nthe circuit is actually 2 * num coils long.\n– Return Value: A pointer to the newly-formed circuit.\n– Notes: See the notes under flower attack one router; the same applies\nhere.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully established.\n• (TS//SI) circuit t *append coil to circuit (char *routernick1,\nchar *routernick2, int num coils, circuit t *circ)\n– Description: Similar to the coil attack, but puts the coil at the end of a\ngiven circuit. Using this, MJOLNIR is anonymized by the structure of the Tor\ncloud.\n– Arguments:\n1. routernick1 : the first router in the coil.\n2. routernick2 : the second router in the coil.\n3. num coils: The number of times each router appears in the coil. The\nresulting circuit will be as long as circ plus 2 * num coils.\n4. circ: The circuit to which MJOLNIR appends the coil.\n– Return Value: the newly-formed circuit.\n\n45\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n– Notes: See the documentation for the coil attack.\nWarning : This call is blocking. It will halt program execution until a circuit\nhas been successfully extended.\n\nF\nF.1\n\n(U//FOUO) MJOLNIR for Windows\n(U) Interface\n\n(TS//SI) The GUI provides the user with a list of all the circuits created by the client.\nThe list displays relevant information about each circuit, including its length, state, and\npurpose. Additionally, each circuit has an light icon next to its name. The light is red if\nthe circuit is closed (cannot be used). The light is green if the circuit is open and ready\nfor use. Beneath the circuit list, a list of the servers in a circuit is displayed for the last\ncircuit clicked. Similar to the circuits, the servers each have a light next to their names to\nindicate whether the circuit is open up to that server. The displays for the circuit list and\nthe node list are set to update on a timer (currently set to three seconds.) On the right,\nthe GUI provides a list of servers that are available for use in a circuit. The router list\ndoes not update on the timer. To update the router list, the user must click the “Load\nRouters” button.\n\nF.2\n\n(S//SI) Creating new circuits\n\n(TS//SI) The GUI provides a few different ways to create new circuits. The most general\nway to create a new circuit is to click the “New Circuit” button. This will create a\nnull circuit with a user-specified name and purpose (see the Tor documentation for more\ninformation on circuit purpose.) The user can then proceed to build a circuit by appending\nservers individually to the end of the circuit. Alternatively, the user can create a random\ncircuit of arbitrary length by clicking the “New Random Circuit” button. The user then\nspecifies a name and length n, and MJOLNIR will choose n random servers from the\navailable router list and create a new circuit. Currently, all random circuits are made with\n“General” purpose. Modifying the program so that the user can specify the purpose of a\nrandom circuit only requires a minor change at the library level. However, it is likely that\ncreating circuits of certain purposes will cause the program to crash (see below.) Circuits\ncan also be created using the coil or flower attacks (see section 7.1, DoS-Style Attacks.)\n(TS//SI) To append a server to a circuit, the user must first select the desired circuit\nby clicking on its name in the circuit list. This causes the chosen circuit to become current,\nwhich means it is the circuit whose node list is currently displayed. Then the user rightclicks on the name of the desired server in the router list and selects “Append to Current\nCircuit.” Any “General” purpose circuit that is open can have a server appended to it.\n(TS//SI) It should be noted that circuits created with certain purposes cannot have\nservers appended to them, and trying to do so will crash the program. Currently, only\n“General”, “Introducing”, and “Establish Rend” circuits are able to have servers appended\n\n46\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//20291123\n\nFigure 3: (TS//SI) Appending a server to a pre-existing circuit.\nto them. Once a server is appended to an “Establish Rend” circuit, its purpose becomes\n“Rend Ready” (a one-hop circuit to a rendezvous point) and attempting to append any\nmore servers will cause a crash. This will need to be cleaned up as functionality for creating\nrendezvous circuits and accessing hidden services is added.\n\nF.3\n\n(TS//SI) DoS-style attacks\n\n(TS//SI) The GUI provides an interface for performing the coil and flower DoS attacks\nfrom the MJOLNIR library. In the coil attack, the user chooses two servers to attack and\nthe number of coils in the circuit. Each server appears once in the circuit for each coil, so\nthe length of the circuit will be twice the number of coils. For the flower attack, the user\nchooses a server to attack and the number of petals, where the number of petals is the\nnumber of times the selected server will appear in the circuit.\n(TS//SI) For both attacks, the user has the option to create the coil or flower as a\nnew circuit or to append it to an existing circuit.

Upon clicking “Send”, the packet is encrypted with the\nappropriate layers of encryption and sent through the circuit.

Carried out as Op MULLENIZE, this\noperation is beginning to yield positive results, particularly in . User Agent Staining is\na technique that involves writing a unique marker (or stain) onto a target machine. Each stain is visible in\npassively collected SIGINT and is stamped into every packet, which enables all the events from that stained\nmachine to be brought back together to recreate a brow sing session.\n\nMuch of the work in CT operations involves understanding extremists? use of the Internet. Generally, this\nis achieved by looking through passively collected SIGINT data and using that information to recreate an\nInternet session, based on what was happening on a particular IP address at a particular time.\n\nThe location of collection assets or the telecoms infrastructure of some countries means that the IP address\nseen attached to each event collected might not be the one actually used by the target to access the Internet.\nThese IP addresses might be servers, proxies or NATs (Network Address Translators the Internet?facing\ndevice in a private network of machines) and they can play havoc with the ability to recreate an internet\nsession for an individual.\n\nexample of a region using massive NATs, with thousands of users on one IP address at\nany one time making it virtually impossible to identify our targets in that country. The idea of large scale\nstaining of machines seemed to present a solution to this problem.\n\nIn order to deploy these stains at scale across machines used by the extremist community\n\ndecided to target machines where the users visited extremist web forums\n\nused to deliver the stains to each target machine. mechanism that leverages \nhuge passive SIGINT accesses to deliver CNE payloads to targets. As this is a very new approach to\ntackling a tough target, it took 12 months for policy, collection, processing and CNE issues to be resolved,\nbut after a lot of hard work by some committed individuals across Benhall, Bude and SOUNDER,\nsuccessful implementation of staining at scale was achieved.\n\nOver 150 stains are now deployed against machines the technique has been adopted to help\nwith work agains with nearly 200 stains deployed there in the last 2 months. Analysis\nis becoming easier and the benefits are being felt outside of the teams that started the work. An unexpected\nbenefit from this work is that targeting any of the machines that have been stained for further CNE efforts\nis much easier.\n\nThis is a great example of CNE effects enabling passive SIGINT and then this in turn enabling CNE and\nwill hopefully lead the way for future joint projects on hard targets.\n\nIf you would like to hear more about the techniques and tools used in Op MULLENIZE sign up for a\nMission News Live presentation on Tuesday, 16 October.\n\n \n\n",

All SID employees are welcome to attend.\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) Analysts and Mission Managers: On 29 November, SIGINT\nsigned SID Management Directive (SMD) 424, which changes\nprocedures regarding metadata analysis. Specifically, these new procedures\npennit contact chaining, and other analysis, from and through\nany selector, irrespective ofnationality or location, in order to\nfollow or discover validforeign intelligence targets. (Formerly\nanalysts were required to determine whether or not selectors were associated\nv.>ith US communicants.)\n(U) The Impact\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) These new procedures allow NSA to fully exploit\ncommunications metadata (which is strictly defined in the procedures), for\nforeign intelligence purposes, without the restrictions associated with selection\nof communications content. The impact of the new procedures is two-fold. In\nthe first place it allows NSA to discover and track connections between foreign\nintelligence targets and possible 2nd Party or US communicants. In the second\nplace it enables large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of\ncommunications metadata v.>ithout having to check foreignness of every node\nor address in the graph. Analysts in S2 have used this to great benefit over the\npast year and a half under a pilot program.\n\n\f(U) Compliance Issues\n\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) SIGINT Management Directive 424 (\"SIGINT Development-Communications Metadata Analysis\") provides guidance on the NSA/ CSS\nimplementation of the \"Department of Defense Supplemental Procedures\nGoverning Communications Metadata Analysis\" (SPCMA), as approved by the\nU.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense. The SPCMA covers\ncommunications metadata collected under Executive Order 12333 authorities.\n(S/ / SI/ / REL) As does any new authority or capability, the Supplemental\nProcedures (SPCMA) come with a cost in terms of additional care that we must\ntake '~ith respect to compliance responsibilities and obligations. The\nprimary new responsibility is the requirement:\n\n• to enter a foreign intelligence (FI) justification for making a query\nor starting a chain,\nand\n• to perform spot-checks of user qu eries.\nAdditionally, the analyst must remain cognizant of minimization procedures\nassociated with retention and dissemination of US person information.\nSPCMA covers analytic procedures and does not affect existing procedures\nfor collection, retention or dissemination of US person information.\n(S/ SI/ / REL) SPCMA obligations also include the need for additional training\non what the procedures do and do not cover, advisory banners on SPCMA\nenabled metadata databases, query auditing, and annual reports to the\nDepartment of Justice.

In addition to the required online informational briefmg, a series of\nlive information briefmgs are being planned.

(U) PURPOSE\na.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) This agreement between NSA and The Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU) prescribes\nprocedures and responsibilities for ensuring that ISNU handling of materials provided by NSA - including, but\nnot limited to, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) technology and equipment and raw SIGINT data (i.e., signals\nintelligence information that has not been reviewed for foreign intelligence purposes or minimized) - is\nconsistent with the requirements placed upon NSA by U.S. law and Executive Order to establish safeguards\nprotecting the rights of U.S. persons under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nb. (TS//SI//REL) This agreement will apply to any SIGINT raw traffic, technology, or enabling that NSA may\nprovide to ISNU. This agreement applies only to materials provided by NSA and shall not be construed to\napply to materials collected independently by ISNU.\nc.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) ISNU also recognizes that NSA has agreements with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the\nUnited Kingdom that require it to protect information associated with U.K. persons, Australian persons,\nCanadian persons and New Zealand persons using procedures and safeguards similar to those applied for U.S.\npersons. For this reason, in all uses of raw material provided by NSA, ISNU agrees to apply the procedures\noutlined in this agreement to persons of these countries.\n\nd. (U) This agreement is not intended to create any legally enforceable rights and shall not be construed to be\neither an international agreement or a legally binding instrument according to international law.\nII. (U) DEFINITIONS\na. (C//SI//REL) Raw SIGINT is any SIGINT acquired either as a result of search and development, or targeted\ncollection operations against a particular foreign intelligence target before the information has been evaluated\nfor foreign intelligence and minimized. Raw SIGINT includes, but is not limited to. unevaluated and\nunminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) metadata and\ncontent.\nb. (U//FOUO) Minimization is the process used to determine whether U.S. person information encountered in\nraw SIGINT is essential to assess or understand the significance of the foreign intelligence. The NSA Special\nUS Liaison Advisor Israel (SUSLAIS) should be consulted any time U.S. person information is found in raw\nSIGINT data supplied by NSA.\nc. (U) A U.S. Person is:\n1) (U) a citizen of the United States;\n2) (U) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States (informally referred to as a\n\"green card\" holder);\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, ISR\n\n\f1 wr\n\nIVI^ i ' > V^ v^lVlli>l 1 ' i IVCL 1U UJrt,\n\n3) (U) an unincorporated group or association, a substantial number of the members of which constitute (1)\nor (2) above; or\n4) (U) a company incorporated within the United States, including U.S.-flagged non-governmental aircraft\nor vessels, but not including those entities which are openly acknowledged by a foreign government or\ngovernments to be directed and controlled by them.\n5) (U) Additionally, a person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a \"U.S. person\"\nunless that person is reasonably identified as an alien who has not been admitted for permanent\nresidence, or if the nature of the person's communications or other information in the contents or\ncircumstances of such communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a U.S.\nperson. Any person located outside the United States will be treated as a non-U.S. person unless there is\na reasonable belief that such person is a U.S. person.\nIII. (U) BACKGROUND\na.\n\n(TS//S1//REL) NSA routinely sends ISNU minimized and unminimized raw collection associated with\nselectors from multiple Target Office Primary Interest (TOPI) offices in Analysis and Production, S2 as part of\nthe SIGINT relationship between the two organizations. This mutually agreed upon exchange has been\nbeneficial to both N S A ' s and ISNU's mission and intelligence requirements.\n\nb. (TS//SI//REL) NSA and ISNU have previously discussed the protection of U.S. Person information, in relation\nto tasking joint collection operations, and agreed in principle to not task communications of U.S. citizens. The\nproposal to share unminimized raw collection requires additional procedures to meet formal requirements.\nIn March 2009, ISNU was given an overview briefing during the Raw Material conference and agreed, in\nprincipal to protect U.S. Person information. It was determined that more formalized training is needed. The\ndate of this training is TBD.\nIV. (U) RESPONSIBILITIES\na.\n\n(U) NSA shall:\n1) (TS//SI//REL) Provide an annual review and training of these procedures with ISNU.\n2) (TS//SI//REL) Regularly review a sample of files transferred to ISNU to validate the absence of U.S.\nPersons identities.\n\nb. (U) ISNU shall:\n1 ) (TS//SI//REL) Not use any technology or equipment that is furnished under the accommodation\nprocurement process to (a) intentionally target communications to, from, or about U.S. Persons\nanywhere in the world or (b) intentionally target any person meeting the definition of a U.S. Person\nprovided in Section II above.\n2) (TS//SI//REL) Not use any information provided by NSA, as raw material or otherwise, to intentionally\nintercept the communications to, from or about a U.S. person. \"Intercept\" means the use of words or\nphrases, such as a name, telex number or answerback, address, telephone number, email address or any\nTOP S EC RE T//COMIN T//RE L TO USA, ISR\n\n\fiur\n\nivr: 1 ' ^vjiviu*\n\ni\n\ni yj\n\nu^rt,\n\ncombination of such terms, to acquire non-public communications. It applies to both electronic and\nmanual acquisition, including follow-on queries of stored communications.\n3) (TS//SIVREL) Strictly limit access to storage systems containing raw SIGINT provided by NSA\nexclusively to properly cleared ISNU personnel and to properly cleared members of Israeli Intelligence\nservices who ISNU has determined have a strict need to know. Access will be limited to those\nindividuals who have been trained in the aforementioned procedures.\n4) (TS//SI//REL) Disseminate foreign intelligence information concerning U.S. persons derived from raw\nSIGINT provided by NSA - to include any release outside ISNU in the form of reports, transcripts,\ngists, memoranda, or any other form of written or oral document or transmission ~ only in a manner\nthat does not identify the U.S. person. ISNU agrees that it will shield the identities of U.S. persons both\nby name and by context, i.e. its disseminations shall be in such a way that a reasonably well-informed\nperson cannot identify the U.S. person from the other contents of the dissemination.\n5) (U//FOUO) Ensure that any files containing the identities of U.S. persons withheld from dissemination\nare retained for no more than one year.\n6) (TS/7SI/7REL) Ensure that any requests from outside parties, including all ISNU customers, for release\nof such identities are referred to NSA, and that same is not released without written permission from\nNSA.\n7) (U//FOUO) Destroy upon recognition any communication contained in raw SIGINT provided by NSA\nthat is either to or from an official of the U.S. Government. \"U.S. Government officials\" include\nofficials of the Executive Branch (including the White House, Cabinet Departments, and independent\nagencies); the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate (members and staff); and the U.S. Federal\nCourt system (including, but not limited to, the Supreme Court). \"Officials\" include civilian and\nmilitary members and employees performing the official business of these branches of government, and\nis independent of seniority or position.\n8) (U//FOUO) Process only for purposes unrelated to intelligence against the U.S any communications\ncontained in raw SIGINT provided by NSA that include references to activities, policies, and views of\nU.S. officials.\nV. (U) PROCEDURES\na.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) ISNU must inform NSA immediately upon detection, via the SUSLA1S. when the identity of a\nU.S. person is found in the raw SIGINT provided to ISNU. Additionally, ISNU must provide a written report,\nvia the SUSLAIS and CHIPPEWA on a quarterly basis, detailing the circumstances of those instances.\n\nb. (TS//SI//REL) ISNU must inform NSA immediately upon discovery, via the SUSLAIS, of inadvertent\nintercept of U.S. person communications where a selector that is believed to belong to a valid foreign target is\nsubsequently found to belong to a U.S. person. ISNU further agrees to detask any and all such selectors, and to\ndestroy any intercept collected as a result of such selectors, whether processed or not.\nVI. (U) OVERSIGHT\na.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) ISNU agrees to put in place appropriate management controls to ensure adherence to the above\npolicies, and to provide NSA with an annual report describing these controls and enumerating any and all\nTOP SECRET7COMINT//REL TO USA. ISR\n\n\fi vyr\n\nvA/iviiiN i\n\nivr.i-\n\nioiv\n\nviolations of the above policies regarding access, collection, and dissemination. This report will be filed with\nthe SUSLA1S, who will send it to NSA HQS Office of Inspector General and ISNU Oversight and\nCompliance.\nb.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) NSA agrees to assist ISNU with the implementation of appropriate management controls. NSA\nwill also provide an annual review and training of these procedures to ISNU.\n\nVII. (U) REV IEW AND AMENDMENTS\na.\n\n(U) This MOU is effective immediately upon execution and shall remain valid until modified or rescinded by\nmutual agreement. It may be terminated unilaterally upon written notice by either party to the other.\n\nb. (U) The terms and conditions of this MOU shall be reviewed at least every two years or upon request by any of\nthe parties.\nc.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) Amendments to this MOU will be in writing, mutually agreed to by both Parties, and executed\nby authorized delegates for the Israeli and U.S. Government. A copy of all amendments will be appended to\neach copy of this document, dated, and consecutively numbered.\n\nd.\n\n(U) Any disputes or disagreements with regard to the interpretation of this MOU will be resolved through\ndiscussion by all parties. The parties agree that they will not attempt to enforce the terms of the MOU in any\ndomestic, third party, or international court or tribunal.\n\nVIII. (U) LANGUAGE\n(U//FOUO) This agreement is executed in the English language.\nIX. (U) FUNDING\na.\n\n(U) Except as provided herein, this agreement does not sanction the transfer or exchange of appropriated funds\nor authorized manpower between the parties.\n\nb. (U) No appropriated funds are obligated by this agreement. Funding is subject to availability of appropriated\nfunds, and must comply with the Anti-Deficiency Act, 21 U.S.C. § 1341 and § 1517.\nX. (U) POINTS OF CONTACT\na.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) The NSA HQS point of contact for this MOU is the Country Desk Officer (CDO) for Israel,\nForeign Affairs Directorate.\n\nb.\n\n(TS//SI//REL) The NSA representative to Israel is the Special U.S. Special Liaison Advisor Israel (SUSLAIS).\n\nc.\n\n(U//FOUO) The ISNU point of contact is the Head of ISNU Foreign Relations.\n\nXI.

These design changes make the systems\nin question exploitable through SIGINT collection (e.g., Endpoint, MidPoint, etc.) with foreknowledge of the\nmodification. To the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact. In this\nway, the SIGINT Enabling approach uses commercial technology and insight to manage the increasing cost and\ntechnical challenges of discovering and successfully exploiting systems of interest within the ever-more integrated\nand security-focused global communications environment.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project supports the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity\nInitiative (CNCI) by investing in coiporate partnerships and providing new access to intelligence sources,\nreducing collection and exploitation costs of existing sources', and enabling expanded network operation and\nintelligence exploitation to support network defense and cyber situational awareness. This Project contains the\nSIGINT Enabling Sub-Project.\n(U) Base resources in this project are used to:\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems,\nnetworks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Collect target network data and metadata via cooperative network carriers\nand/or increased control over core networks.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Leverage commercial capabilities to remotely deliver or receive information\nto and from target endpoints.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Exploit foreign trusted computing platforms and technologies.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Influence policies, standards and specification for commercial public key\ntechnologies.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Make specific and aggressive investments to facilitate the development of\na robust exploitation capability against Next-Generation Wireless (NGW) communications.\n• (U//FOUO) Maintain understanding of commercial business and technology trends.\n• (U//FOUO) Procure products for internal evaluation.\n• (U//FOUO) Partner with industry and/or government agencies in developing technologies of strategic\ninterest to NSA/CSS.\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n115\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support the SIGINT exploitation of NGW, a MIP/NIP collective\ninvestment. This request reflects only the NIP portion of the program. Refer to MIP NSA volume for details\non MIP related activities.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide for continued partnerships with major telecommunications carriers\nto shape the global network to benefit other collection accesses and allow the continuation of partnering with\ncommercial Managed Security Service Providers and threat researchers, doing threat/vulnerability analysis.\n• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Continue relationships with commercial IT partners and capitalize on new\nopportunities, including the enabling of cryptography used by the\ngovernments; enable the encryption being used in a high interest satellite signal, which allows access to the\ncommunications being carried on a commercial satellite provider.\n(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.\n(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:\n• (TS//SI//NF) Reach an initial operating capability for SIGINT access to data flowing through a commercial\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ anonymous\nservice.

We face\nworldwide threats that are expanding in scope and complexity. This Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 National Intelligence\nProgram (NIP) budget reflects hard choices to ensure critical national security requirements are addressed in the\nface of a reduced budget environment. We must be prepared to accept -- and manage -- reasonable risk.\n(U//FOUO) Keeping America safe by providing the finest intelligence support to our policymakers, military,\nlaw enforcement partners, and allies remains our highest priority. With the superb talent and ingenuity of our\nworkforce, the IC will continue to deploy the most technologically sophisticated and innovative intelligence\ncapabilities in the world. Through integration and efficiency, we will sustain responsive, insightful intelligence\nsupport.\n(S//NF) The FY 2013 NIP budget of $52.6 billion (including $4.9 billion for Overseas Contingency\nOperations (OCO)) and 107,035 positions supports the National Intelligence Strategy and advances our Nation’s\nsecurity priorities. This budget represents a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 2.4 percent, below the FY 2012 enacted\nlevel; and it reduces personnel by 1,241 positions, or one percent. The request meets the fiscal demands laid out\nin the Budget Control Act by setting the IC on a path to reduce expenditures by $25 billion for ten years; with\nover $15 billion of that amount saved by FY 2017.\n\n(U) Developing a Balanced Intelligence Budget\n(S) The IC leadership worked as a corporate body to develop the budget. The team first drew on lessons learned\nfrom the drawdown in the 1990s, which left the IC with a distorted workforce that lacked sufficient mid-career\npersonnel and technical expertise. As a result of that drawdown, the IC reverted to extraordinary measures to\nrebuild and balance the workforce. Moreover, we deferred infrastructure recapitalization, resulting in obsolete\nfacilities, single point failures, and inadequate power, space, and cooling. We also delayed investment, reducing\nour ability to keep pace with technical advances to meet mission needs.\n(U) Second, we looked forward to determine how best to meet increasing mission requirements over the next\ndecade in a resource-constrained environment. The IC leadership weighed the relative merit of capabilities and\nlooked at dependencies across the components. In addition, we coordinated closely with the Defense and domestic\ndepartments to minimize disconnects and ensure balance.\n(S) At the outset, I determined that we would not take a proportional reduction from each IC program, but\nrather compare relative merits of programs. We carefully weighed cost and risk to understand both the short\nand long term impact of our actions. To maximize investments for the future, we focused reductions on lower\npriority capabilities; sought efficiencies and smarter ways to do business; and prudently accepted risk. Overall,\nthis budget is guided by the imperative to achieve the right balance against competing demands. Our guiding\nprinciples were to:\n• (U) Sustain a skilled workforce;\n• (U) Focus on further integration and collaboration;\n• (U) Bolster agile capabilities that support multiple missions;\n• (S) Enhance counterintelligence; and\n• (U) Protect key investment for the future.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n(U) Reductions\n(U) To the extent possible, we protected the activities highlighted above; but with the magnitude of the\nreduction, we could not avoid limited, targeted cuts to priority areas. The following are some activities reduced\nfrom the base budget plan:\n• (S//NF) Sustained Congressional Cuts. We sustain FY 2012 cuts to the CIA’s Global Deployment Initiative\nand NRO’s Integrated Ground Architecture.\n• (S) Workforce. We continue Congressional reductions to the government workforce; curtail plans for future\npersonnel growth, and take targeted reductions to baseline personnel where the risk can be managed.\nFurthermore, we reflect savings from a lower than projected civilian pay raise and continue to reduce our\nreliance on core contractors.\n• (TS//NF) Operations. We decrease collection, production, and hard copy media generation in the GEOINT\nsystem, slow SIGINT network exploitation and processing modernization; cut GDIP HUMINT, non-core\nMASINT, covert action programs, and some Specialized Reconnaissance Programs (SRP) operations;\nand streamline the ODNI business transformation activities. Furthermore, we discontinue or terminate\nsome lower-priority missions, such as de-orbiting the Baseline ONYX satellite and transferring funding\nresponsibility to the MIP for legacy satellites.\n• (S//TK//NF) Long-Term Investments. We are terminating an NRO compartmented project, delaying\nTOPAZ performance enhancements until the second generation of TOPAZ satellites; and reducing\ntechnology insertion opportunities in other satellites. In addition, we are delaying some SRP investments\nand terminating the Community’s investment in a consolidated human resources information system.\n• (S//NF) Infrastructure. We reduce enterprise management activities; eliminate the IC Data Center;\ndownsize the IC Bethesda Campus; suspend some facility improvements; and delay the replacement of\naged facility components. As a result, we will continue to house some of the IC workforce in older and less\ncapable facilities that may not meet current antiterrorism/force protection requirements and we will accept\nsome degradation in the IC’s facility condition index.\n• (S//NF) Information Technology. We reduce capital equipment replacement and recapitalization; decrease\nsupport for heritage systems; delay consolidation of older systems; and eliminate plans for additional backup\nsystems. These offsets prevent spending to sustain or improve legacy environments when our direction is\nto establish a new IT environment based on more centralized common services. Investments required to\nestablish a more efficient IC IT Enterprise are protected.\n(U) Investments\n(U) Although the budget is declining, the mission is not. Prioritizing our requirements was a key element to\nproduce a budget that meets customer needs, supports critical capabilities, addresses gaps, and helps to maintain\na strategic advantage. In the FY 2013 NIP budget, the IC makes targeted investments in:\n• (TS//SI//NF) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). We are bolstering our support for clandestine SIGINT\ncapabilities to collect against high priority targets, including foreign leadership targets. Also, we are\ninvesting in groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit\ninternet traffic.\n• (S//NF) Cybersecurity. As the cyber threat continues to grow, we sustain the budget for the Comprehensive\nNational Cybersecurity Initiative and begin construction of a second High Performance Computing Center\nat Fort Meade, Maryland to keep pace with cyber processing demands.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n• (TS//NF) Counterintelligence (CI). To further safeguard our classified networks, we continue to strengthen\ninsider threat detection capabilities across the Community. In addition, we are investing in target\nsurveillance and offensive CI against key targets, such as China, Russia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and Cuba.\n• (S//TK//NF) Major System Acquisitions (MSA). We are sustaining the acquisition baseline and maintaining\nthe schedule for the MSAs that replace current capabilities. For example, the NRO is modernizing overhead\nSIGINT, geospatial, and communications major system acquisitions. To reduce reliance on the Tracking and\nData Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), the NRO begins investing in a special communications capability.\nAlso, launch requirements are fully funded.\n• (S//NF) Ballistic Missile Collection. We are pursuing an affordable MASINT solution for integrating,\nimproving, and sustaining coverage of and collection against North Korean, Iranian, Chinese, Russian,\nPakistani and other ballistic missiles threats.\n• (S//NF) Mission Focused Science & Technology (S&T). We continue investing in cutting edge S&T that\nenables new mission capabilities. We are tackling hard problems in quantum computing, biometrics, cyber,\nweapons of mass destruction, and large complex data sets.\n\n(U) Optimizing Our Efforts\n(U) To succeed, the IC must employ its resources judiciously. The need to integrate all elements of the IC\nis essential to identify opportunities as well as dangers. In FY 2011, the elimination of Usama Bin Ladin along\nwith 32 other high value targets is just one testament to IC collaboration. Our ability to rapidly respond to\nthe requirements of Operation Unified Endeavor, while simultaneously maintaining support for operations in\nAfghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, is another. We achieved this by reducing the cultural, technological and\npolicy barriers to sharing information, and exploring new strategies for integrating our intelligence efforts. The\nFY 2013 budget sustains the imperative of integration, and provides the framework and common solutions to\nfurther collaboration.\n(U) Focusing on Integration\n(U) The Office of the DNI has promoted information sharing and collaboration through the integration of\nanalysis and collection at the strategic level. This has improved mission management of key intelligence problems,\nleading to a sharper focus on, and encouragement of, integration within the Community. The heightened attention\non intelligence integration has changed the dynamics of intelligence activities. Without requiring individual IC\nelements to reorganize, the emphasis on integration has led Community elements to think and operate in ways\nthat are responsive to strategic management and direction that encourages, recognizes, and rewards integrated\nintelligence operations.\n(U//FOUO) The National Intelligence Managers (NIM) are the principal agents of mission integration. They\noversee and integrate all aspects of the IC’s efforts against a particular regional or functional problem to provide a\nmore complete understanding of the associated issues. A major responsibility includes the development, planning,\nexecution, and oversight of Unifying Intelligence Strategies (UIS) for their individual accounts, with the principal\naim of managing the relevant policies, priorities, and relationships among the IC elements who participate in\neach of these target domains.\n(U//FOUO) These UIS are the instruments that are used to integrate IC efforts against critical priorities. Each\nUIS supports decision-making by outlining gaps and challenges, as well as opportunities that would most benefit\nfrom integration of IC efforts. In addition, the UIS present a select number of integration initiatives to provide\na holistic perspective across the strategies.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n(U) Promoting Information Sharing\n(U) Information sharing also is a critical enabler of integration across the Community. This budget begins to\nimplement a restructuring of the IC information technology (IT) architecture that will provide a strong backbone\nenabling greater IC integration, information sharing, and improved safeguarding of networks. The need for the\nIC to contribute to deficit reduction was the catalyst for achieving greater efficiencies in information technology.\nThe IC IT Enterprise will transform from agency-centric IT programs which are often duplicative and costly, to\ngreater centralization of common services for IC-wide use. Within this framework, we are leveraging existing\nefforts across the Community and sustaining unique approaches only when they are essential to the mission.\nFurthermore, we are investigating data management solutions and their associated security issues, such as the\nviability of comingling data in virtualized data stores to facilitate analytical integration of different data from\ndifferent sources and Agencies. This includes new management and operating practices for the secure storage and\nhandling of the varied information contained in different intelligence systems through the use of cloud computing.\n(U) Engaging Partners\n(U) Expanding the IC’s culture of sharing with our partners is essential to leverage and maximize our collective\ncapabilities. We are strengthening relationships with federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners to fuse\ndomestic and foreign intelligence to quickly understand and act on threats. Through coordinated efforts, we can\noptimize our efforts to improve intelligence support.\n(U) As part of the Administration's overall foreign trade initiative, the IC will more closely coordinate its\nintelligence gathering and analysis efforts with federal agencies responsible for monitoring foreign trade barriers\nand enforcing U.S. trade rights under international trade agreements. The IC will directly support and strengthen\nU.S. interagency trade enforcement efforts to address unfair trade practices through the World Trade Organization\nand under other domestic and international trade enforcement authorities\n(U) Furthermore, the IC is postured to support the warfighter as the Department of Defense implements a new\nstrategy. The strategy is consistent with the IC approach to the FY 2013 budget. We will support the increased\nfocus on the Pacific region, and surge as needed for military operations. In addition, we expect there will be a\ngreater reliance on the IC to provide global coverage and warning of emerging threats.\n(U) Aligning Resources\n(U) This year, the IC implemented guiding principles to clarify responsibility for programming NIP resources.\n(S) The IC developed guidelines to more clearly delineate programming responsibility for the NIP and the\nMIP to further optimize resource allocation. These guidelines better align NIP and MIP resources with mission\nrequirements, reduce the number of split funded projects, and enable more efficient budget execution. The\nFY 2013 budget begins to implement the guidelines by transferring $165 million and 1,078 positions between\nthe NIP and MIP. This transfer maintains the mission, function, and execution of activities; it does not represent\ngrowth in either program.\n(S) In addition, the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) implemented a change in how it accounts\nfor resources that support the intelligence mission. Beginning in the FY 2013 budget, activities that predominately\nsupport departmental missions are funded outside the NIP. Under the new methodology, $11 million and\n44 positions are transferred out of the NIP.\n\n(U) Supporting Current Intelligence Operations\n(S//NF) In FY 2013, the IC will continue to provide crucial intelligence support to military operations in\nAfghanistan and to combat terrorism worldwide.\n(S//SI//NF) The request for Afghanistan and Pakistan decreases as support for the military’s counterterrorism\nand counterinsurgency operations declines, coincident with planned troop reductions. Accordingly, this request\nsustains HUMINT and CI operations, along with the related analytic, processing, and exploitation capabilities.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\nAlso, NSA is augmenting SIGINT access and penetration, and Treasury enhances threat finance analysis to track\nterrorist and insurgent networks.\n(TS//NF) With the completion of the military drawdown in Iraq, intelligence support transitions to a smaller\nlong-term presence. The IC’s request is significantly reduced from FY 2012 as our support focuses on providing\nforeign intelligence in support of diplomatic activities and monitoring Iraq’s plans and intentions and those of its\nvolatile neighbor, Iran. This budget sustains HUMINT operations, with a smaller footprint, as well as SIGINT\ncollection capabilities. Most support for media exploitation, commercial imagery, and other operational enablers\nis eliminated.\n(TS//NF) The counterterrorism (CT) mission requires a global perspective to predict, penetrate, and preempt\nglobal threats to U.S. security. Therefore, the IC is sustaining operations, analytic, and enabling activities. With\nYemen, Somalia, and other Horn of Africa countries emerging as the most recent breeding ground for terrorism,\nthe IC is increasing efforts in those regions. Furthermore, we are sustaining CT capabilities in Libya to deny\nextremists a safe haven. In an effort to reduce our reliance on OCO as a funding vehicle, we transfer to the base\nsome enduring long term activities.\n(S//NF) The counterproliferation (CP) mission continues to support a variety of actions to deter, disrupt, and\nprevent proliferation. This includes improving our understanding of Pakistani nuclear weapons and dangerous\nnuclear material security; intelligence on proliferators, such as Iran and North Korea, to roll back and block\nweapons programs; increasing our ability to ascertain global chemical and biological threats; and better\nintegrating multidiscipline coverage of WMD targets such as chemical weapons in Libya and Syria.\n\n(U) Moving Forward\n(S//NF) Today’s national security threats virtually defy rank-ordering. Capabilities, technologies, know-how,\ncommunications, and environmental forces are not confined by borders, and can trigger transnational disruptions\nwith astonishing speed. Never before has the IC been called upon to master such complexity and so many issues\nin such a resource-constrained environment. We are rising to the challenge by continuing to integrate the IC,\ncapitalize on new technologies, implement new efficiencies, and, as always, remaining vigilant 24/7 worldwide.\n(U//FOUO) The pressure to maintain the world’s premier intelligence enterprise in the face of shrinking\nbudgets will be difficult. We will accept and manage risk, more so than we’ve had to in the last decade.\n(U//FOUO) This NIP budget proposed is balanced and executable. It does not reflect the potential for a\nsequester in January 2013. Instead, the FY 2013 President’s Budget proposes savings in other areas that exceed\nthe Joint Committee threshold, and as a result seeks to cancel the automatic reductions and restore the caps to\nthe original definitions in the Budget Control Act.\n(U) Intelligence is the first line of defense. This budget provides the programs and initiatives vital to our\nnational security. Our partnership with you -- our Congressional oversight committees -- is critical to our\ncollective success. With your continued support, the IC can continue to fulfill our mission to keep America and\nits interests secure.\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\nFY 2013 Mission Objective Funding*\n$52.0 Billion\nCIARDS funding not included.\n\nIntegrate\nCounterintelligence\n7%\n\nEnhance\nCybersecurity\n8%\n\nCombat Violent\nExtremism\n33%\n\nProvide Strategic\nIntelligence and Warning\n39%\nCounter Weapons\nProliferation\n13%\n\n* MO6: Support to Current Operations is covered in other MO sections.\n\nFigure 1.\nThis Figure is SECRET//NOFORN\n\n116030_vol01_ill01.ai\n\nTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN\n\nFY 2011 Intelligence Community Civilian Workforce\nGrade Distribution by Average Age\n30,000\n\n75\n\n60\n\n20,000\n45\n15,000\n30\n10,000\n\nNumber of Years\n\nNumber of Civilians\n\n25,000\n\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\n0\nGrade\n6 Below\n\nGS 7-10 GS 11-12 GS 13-14\n\nGS-15\n\nAverage Age\n\nPayband Payband Payband Payband Payband\n\nSES\n\nAverage Years of Service\n\nGrade by Years of Service\n100\n\n>35\n\nPercentage of Workforce\n\n31-34\n26-30\n\n80\n\n21-25\n16-20\n11-15\n\n60\n\n6-10\n1-5\n<1\n\n40\n\n\n0\nGrade\n6 Below\n\nGS 7-10\n\nGS 11-12 GS 13-14\n\nGS 15\n\nPayband Payband Payband Payband Payband\n\nSES\n\nNote: This chart contains data adjusted to facilitate display in whole percentages only and some categories with <0.50% will display as 0%.

The number of incidents in\neach category and a reference to the annex related to each incident category are contained in the body of the\nreport.\n(U//FOUO) As part of SID Oversight and Compliance’s (SV) charge to provide comprehensive trends and\nanalysis information as it pertains to incidents of non-compliance, this Executive Summary provides analysis\nand evaluation of incidents reported throughout the current quarter to better address the “whys” and “hows”\nbehind NSAW SID’s compliance posture.\n(U//FOUO) Section II, Metrics, has been broken down into several sub-sections: metrics and analysis of\nNSAW SID-reported incidents by authority, type, root cause, and organization. Also included is an assessment\nof how incidents were discovered (i.e., methods of discovery) for SID-reported incidents (see Figure 7).\n(U//FOUO) Significant Incidents of Non-compliance and Report Content follow in Sections III and IV,\nrespectively.\n(S//REL) Overall, the number of incidents reported during 1QCY12 increased by 11% as compared to the\nnumber of incidents reported during 4QCY11. This included a rise in the number of E.O. 12333 incidents, as\nwell as for incidents across all FISA authorities. The majority of incidents in all authorities were database\nquery incidents due to human error. Of note, S2 continued to be the NSAW SID organization with the largest\nnumber of reported incidents (89%), although S2 experienced an overall decrease in reported incidents. SV\nnoted an overall improvement in timeliness regarding 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report submissions from the SID\nelements.\n\nPage 1 of 13\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\nII.\n\n(U) Metrics\na.

From\n4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an overall increase in incidents of 11%. There was also an increase of 11% for\nboth E.O. 12333 and FISA incidents. The increase in incidents reported for 1QCY12 was due to an increase in\nthe number of reported Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) roamer 1 incidents, which may be\nattributed to an increase in Chinese travel to visit friends and family for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.\n(U//FOUO) Figure 1a: Table of the Number of NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Authority\n(U//FOUO)\n\nE.O. 12333\nFISA\nTOTAL\n\n2QCY11\n396\n150\n546\n\n3QCY11\n390\n198\n588\n\n4QCY11\n601\n176\n777\n\n1QCY12\n670\n195\n865\n(U//FOUO)\n\n(U//FOUO) Figure 1b: Line Graph of the Number of NSAW SID-reported Incidents by Authority\nU//FOUO\n800\n\nNumber of Incidents\n\n700\n600\n500\n400\n\nE.O. 12333\n\n300\n\nFISA\n\n200\n100\n0\n2QCY11\n\n3QCY11\n\n4QCY11\n\n1QCY12\n\nQuarter\n\nU//FOUO\n\n(TS//SI//NF) FISA Incidents: As reflected in Figures 1a-b, during 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total\nof 195 FISA incidents, 185 of which were associated with unintentional collection.

Figure 2 illustrates the most common root causes for incidents involving FISA authorities\nas determined by SV.\n•\n\n63% (123) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to Operator Error as the root cause, and\ninvolved:\no Resources ( i.e., inaccurate or insufficient research information and/or workload issues (60);\no Lack of due diligence (i.e., failure to follow standard operating procedures) (39);\no Human error (21) which encompassed:\n Broad syntax (i.e., no or insufficient limiters / defeats / parameters) (12);\n Typographical error (6);\n Query technique understood but not applied (2); and\n Incorrect option selected in tool (1); and\no Training and guidance (i.e., training issues) (3).\n\n(U//FOUO) The Resources root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of Operator Error\nincidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. Analysis identified that these incidents could be reduced if\nanalysts had more complete and consistent information available about selectors and/or targets at the time of\ntasking and if analysts consistently applied rules for conducting queries.\n•\n\n37% (72) of 1QCY12 FISA incidents can be attributed to System Error as the root cause, and\ninvolved:\no System limitations (i.e., system lacks the capability to ‘push’ real-time travel data out to\nanalysts, system/device unable to detect changes in user) (67);\no System engineering (i.e., system/database developed without the appropriate oversight\nmeasures, data flow issues, etc.) (4); and,\no System disruptions (i.e., glitches, bugs, etc.) (1).\n\n(U//FOUO) The System Limitations root cause category accounted for the largest percentage of System\nError incidents under FISA authorities for 1QCY12. The largest number of incidents in the System Limitations\ncategory account for roamers where there was no previous indications of the planned travel. These incidents are\nlargely unpreventable. Consistent discovery through the Visitor Location Register (VLR) occurs every quarter\nand provides analysts with timely information to place selectors into candidate status or detask. Analysis\nidentified that these incidents could be reduced if analysts removed/detasked selectors more quickly upon\nlearning that the status of the selector had changed and more regularly monitored target activity. This analysis\nindicates that continued research on ways to exploit new technologies and researching the various aspects of\npersonal communications systems to include GSM, are an important step for NSA analysts to track the travel of\nvalid foreign targets.\n\nPage 3 of 13\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n(U//FOUO) Figure 2: 1QCY12 FISA Incidents – Root Causes\nU//FOUO\n\n11%\n\nOperator | Human Error (21)\n\n20%\n\nOperator | Due Diligence (39)\nOperator | Resources (60)\nOperator | Training (3)\n\n34%\n31%\n\nSystem | Disruptions (1)\nSystem | Engineering (4)\n\n2%\n\nSystem | Limitations (67)\n\n2%\n\nU//FOUO\n\nTotal: 195\n\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Delayed Detasking FISA Incidents: As reflected in Figures 1a-b, during\n1QCY12, NSAW SID reported a total of 195 FISA incidents. 19 (10%) of the total FISA incidents were\nassociated with detasking delays.

When collection occurs with one or\nboth communicants inside the U.S., this constitutes inadvertent collection. From 4QCY11 to 1QCY12, there was an\nincrease of transit program incidents submitted from 7 to 27, due to the change in our methodology for reporting and\ncounting of these types of incidents. (*See Annex G in SID’s 1QCY12 IO Quarterly Report for additional details\n\nregarding these incidents.)\n\nPage 5 of 13\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN\n(U//FOUO) Figure 4b: NSAW SID-reported Collection Incidents Under\nAll FISA Authorities\nU//FOUO\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n0\n\n2QCY11\n81\n\n87\n\n3QCY11\n\n4QCY11\n\n1QCY12\n\n95\n69\n\n55\n\n49\n\n54\n\n36\nRoamers\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNo FISC/AG\nAuth\n\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nComputer\nNetwork\nExploitation\n(CNE)\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Queries\n\n\n\n\nTask/Detask\nDelays/Errors\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nUSP\n\nOther Inadvertent\n\nU//FOUO\n\n(U//FOUO) Figure 4b: During 1QCY12, NSAW SID reported an increase of 9% of roamer incidents under\nall FISA Authorities. There was also a 260% increase in database query FISA Authority incidents during\n1QCY12.

However, in the 80-page opinion, the judge ordered certain \"upstream\" or\n\"passive\" FAA DNI collection to cease after 30 days, unless NSA implements solutions\nto conect all deficiencies identified in the opinion document. PRISM operations are not\naffected by these caveats. All PRISM providers, except Yahoo and Google, were\nsuccessfully transitioned to the new Certifications. We expect Yahoo and Google to\ncomplete transitioning by Friday 6 Oct. Regarding the non-PRISM FAA collection\nprograms, the Court cited targeting and minimization procedures related to collection of\nMultiple Communications Transactions as \"deficient on statutory and constitutional\ngrounds.\" SSO, Technology Directorate, OGC, and other organizations are coordinating a\nresponse, which includes planning to implement a conservative solution in which the\nliigher-risk collection will be sequestered. It is possible that this higher risk collection\ncontains much of the 11011-duplicative FAA collection resulting in FAA reporting from\nupstream accesses. This solution is designed to comply with the judge's order; however,\nthe judge will have to determine if it does. If the solution is installed, SSO will then work\nwith OPIs and OGC to modify the solution over time such that the filtering process will\nbe optimized to permit more valid collection to be processed and forwarded to OPIs.\nFinally, in parallel with these efforts, the OGC is contemplating filing an appeal to the\nruling.\n\n\f",

Bush issued a\nmemorandum entitled \" A U T H O R I Z A T I O N F O R SPECIFIED\nELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES DURING A LIMITED\nP E R I O D TO D E T E C T A N D P R E V E N T A C T S O F T E R R O R I S M\nW I T H I N T H E U N I T E D STATES.\" The m e m o r a n d u m was based on the\nPresident's determination that after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks\nin the United States, an extraordinary emergency existed for national\ndefense purposes.\n(TS//SI//OR/NF) The 4 October 2001 Presidential authorization delegated\nauthority to the Secretary of Defense, w h o further delegated it to the\nDirector of National Security Agency/Chief. Central Security Service\n( D I R N S A/CHCSSJ to conduct specified electronic surveillance on targets\nrelated to Afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days. Because the\nsurveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of\nthe United States, it would otherwise have required FISC authority.\n(TS//SI//OR/NF) The Authorization specified that N S A could acquire the\ncontent and associated metadata of telephony and Internet communications\nf o r which there was probable cause to believe that one of the\ncommunicants was in Afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged\nin or preparing for acts of international terrorism. In addition, N S A was\nauthorized to acquire telephony and Internet metadata 1 for communications\nwith at least one communicant outside the United States or for which no\ncommunicant w a s known to be a citizen of the United States. N S A w a s\nalso allowed to retain, process, analyze and disseminate intelligence from\nthe communications acquired under the authority. 2\n\n(U) T h i s Report\n(U//FOUO) This report provides the classified results of the N S A Office of\nthe Inspector General (OIG) review of the President's Surveillance\nProgram (PSP) as mandated in the FISA A m e n d m e n t s Act (FAA) of 2008.\nIt includes the facts necessary to describe from N S A ' s perspective:\n\n(U)Metadata is data that describes content, events, or networks associated with SIGINT targets.\n(U)The Authority changed over time. See Appendix B for details.\n\nWORKING\n\nDRAFT\n\nTOP SECRET//STL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nGjf] establishment of the PSP (Section One)\n[x] implementation and product of the PSP (Section Two)\nH\n\naccess to legal reviews of the PSP and access to information about\nthe PSP (Section Three)\n\n(x) interaction with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)\nand transition to court orders related to the PSP (Section Four)\n(¥] oversight of PSP activities at N S A (Section Five)\n\n(U) President's Surveillance Program Terminology\n(U//FOUO) For purposes of this report, the PSP, or \"the Program,\" refers\nto NSA activities conducted under the authority of the 4 October 2001\nmemorandum and subsequent renewals, hereafter known as \"the\nAuthorization.\" As mandated by the FAA, this review includes activities\nauthorized by the President between 11 September 2001 and 17 January\n2007 and those activities continued under FISC authority. This includes\nthe program described by the President in a\n17 December 2005 radio address as the Terrorist Surveillance Program,\nwhich was content collected under the Authorization.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING\n\nII.\n\nDRAFT\n\nREVIEW CATEGORIES\n\n(U) ONE: ESTABLISHMENT OF T H E A U T H O R I T Y\n(U//FOUO) Immediately after the attacks of 11 September 2001, NSA considered\nhow to work within existing SIGINT authorities to counter the terrorist threat\nwithin the United States and adjusted SIGINT processes accordingly. Shortly\nthereafter, in response to a White House request, the Director of NSA identified\nSIGINT collection gaps. The Counsel to the Vice President used this information\nto draft the Presidential authorization that established the PSP.\n\n(U) Actions Taken After 9/11\n(TS//SI//NF) On 14 September 2001, three days after terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States, General Hayden approved the targeting of terroristassociated foreign telephone numbers on communication links between the\nUnited States and foreign countries where terrorists were known to be\noperating. Only specified, pre-approved numbers were allowed to be\ntasked for collection against U.S.-originating links. He authorized this\ncollection at Special Collection Service and Foreign Satellite sites with\naccess to links between the United States and countries of interest,\nincluding Afghanistan. According to the Deputy General Counsel, General\nHayden determined by 26 September that any Afghan telephone number in\ncontact with a U.S. telephone number on or after 26 September was\npresumed to be of foreign intelligence value and could be disseminated to\nthe FBI.\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A OGC said General Hayden's action was a lawful\nexercise of his power under Executive Order (E.O.) 12333, United States\nIntelligence Activities, as amended. The targeting of communication links\nwith one end in the United States was a more aggressive use of E.O. 12333\nauthority than that exercised by former Directors. General Hayden was\noperating in a unique environment in which it was a widely held belief that\nadditional terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were imminent. General Hayden\nsaid this was a \"tactical decision.\"\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U//FOUO) On 2 October 2001, General Hayden briefed the House\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) on this decision and\nlater informed members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(SSCI) by telephone. He had also informed DCI George Tenet.\n(TS) At the same time NSA was assessing collection gaps and increasing\nefforts against terrorist targets immediately after the 11 September attacks,\nit was responding to Department of Defense (DoD), Director of Central\nIntelligence Community Management Staff questions about its ability to\ncounter the new threat.\n\n(U) Need to Expand NSA Authority\n(U//FOUO) General Hayden said that soon after he told Mr. Tenet about\nN S A actions to counter the threat, Mr. Tenet shared the information with\nthe \"Oval Office.\" Mr. Tenet relayed that the Vice President wanted to\nknow if N S A could be doing more. General Hayden replied that nothing\nelse could be done within existing N S A authorities. In a follow-up\ntelephone conversation, Mr. Tenet asked General Hayden what could be\ndone if he had additional authorities. General Hayden said that these\ndiscussions were not documented.\n\n(U//FOUO) NSA Identifies SIGINT Collection Gaps\n(TS//SI//NF) To respond to the Vice President, General Hayden met with\nN S A personnel who were already working to identify and fill SIGINT\ncollection gaps in light of the recent terrorist attacks. General Hayden\nstated that he met with personnel to identify which additional authorities\nwould be operationally useful and technically feasible. In particular,\ndiscussions focused on how N S A might bridge the \"international gap.\" An\nN S A Technical Director described that gap in these terms:\n\"Here is NSA standing at the U.S. border looking outwardfor\nforeign threats. There is the FBI looking within the United\nStates for domestic threats. But no one was looking at the\nforeign threats coming into the United States. That was a\nhuge gap that NSA wanted to cover. \"\n(TS//SI//NF) Possible Solutions. Among other things, N S A considered\nhow to tweak transit collection—the collection of communications\ntransiting through but not originating or terminating in the United States.\nN S A personnel also resurfaced a concept proposed in 1999 to address the\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nMillennium Threat. N S A proposed that it would perform contact chaining\non metadata it had collected. Analysts would chain through masked U.S.\ntelephone numbers to discover foreign connections to those numbers,\nwithout specifying, even for analysts, the U.S. number involved. In\nDecember 1999, the Department of Justice (DoJ), Office of Intelligence\nPolicy Review (OIPR) told N S A that the proposal fell within one of the\nFISA definitions of electronic surveillance and, therefore, was not\npermissible when applied to metadata associated with presumed U.S.\npersons (i.e., U.S. telephone numbers not approved for targeting by the\nFISC).\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Collection gaps not adequately filled by FISA\nauthorized intercept. N S A determined that FISA authorization did not\nallow sufficient flexibility to counter the new terrorist threat. First, it\nbelieved that because of technological advances, the jurisdiction of the\nFISC went beyond the original intent of the statute. For example, most\ncommunications signals no longer flowed through radio signals signals or\nvia phone systems as they did in 1978 when the FISA was written. By\n2001, Internet communications were used worldwide, undersea cables\ncarried huge volumes of communications, and a large amount of the\nworld's communications passed through the United States. Because of\nlanguage used in the Act in 1978, N S A was required to obtain court orders\nto target email accounts used by non-U.S. persons outside the United States\nif it intended to intercept the communications at a webmail service within\nthe United States. Large numbers of terrorists were using such accounts in\n2001.\n(TS//SI//NF) Second, NSA believed that the FISA process was unable to\naccommodate the number of terrorist targets or the speed with which they\nchanged their communications. From the time N S A sent FISA requests to\nthe DoJ, OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average wait was\nbetween four and six weeks. Terrorists could have changed their telephone\nnumbers or internet addresses before N S A received FISC approval to target\nthem. N S A believed the large number of terrorist targets and their\nfrequently changing communications would have overwhelmed the\nexisting FISA process.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Emergency FISA provision not an option. NSA\ndetermined that even using emergency FISA court orders would not\nprovide the speed and flexibility needed to counter the terrorist threat.\nFirst, although the emergency authorization provision permitted 72 hours\nof surveillance without obtaining a court order, it did not—as many\nbelieved—allow the Government to undertake surveillance immediately.\nRather, the Attorney General had to ensure that emergency surveillance\nwould ultimately be acceptable to the FISC. He had to be certain the court\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nwould grant a warrant before initiating emergency surveillance.\nAdditionally, before N S A surveillance requests were submitted to the\nAttorney General, they had to be reviewed by N S A intelligence officers,\nNSA attorneys, and Department of Justice attorneys. Each reviewer had to\nbe satisfied that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the\nnext review group, and each request was certified by a senior official in the\nDoD, usually the Secretaiy or Deputy Secretaiy. From the time N S A sent a\nrequest to Justice's OIPR until the time data arrived at NSA, the average\nwait was between a day and a day and a half. In the existing threat\nenvironment with U.S. interests at risk, N S A deemed the wait too long.\n\n(U//FOUO) Early\n\nEfforts\n\nto Amend\n\nFISA\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Given the limitations of FISA, there were early\nefforts to amend the statute. For example, shortly after 11\nSeptember, the HPSCI asked NSA for technical assistance\nin drafting a proposal to amend Section III of FISA that\nwould give the President the authority to conduct electronic\nsurveillances without a court order for the purpose of\nobtaining foreign intelligence information. On\n20 September 2001, the NSA General Counsel wrote to\nJudge Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the President, asking\nwhether the proposal had merit. We found no record of a\nresponse.\n(U//FOUO) We could not determine why early efforts to\namend FISA were abandoned. Anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that government officials feared the public debate\nsurrounding any changes to FISA would compromise\nintelligence sources and methods.\n\n(U) NSA identifies SIGINT collection gaps to Vice President's Office.\n(TS//SI//NF) Because early discussions about expanding NSA's authority\nwere not documented, we do not have records of specific topics discussed\nor people who attended General Hayden's meetings with White House\nrepresentatives. General Hayden stated that after consulting with N S A\npersonnel, he described to the White House how N S A collection of\ncommunications on a wire inside the United States was constrained by the\nFISA statute. Specifically, N S A could not collect from a wire in the United\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nStates, without a court order, either content or metadata from\ncommunications links with either one or both ends in the United States.\nFurthermore, General Hayden pointed out that communications metadata\ndid not have the same level of constitutional protection as content and that\naccess to metadata of communications with one end in the United States\nwould significantly enhance NSA's analytic capabilities. General Hayden\nsuggested that the ability to collect communications with one end in the\nUnited States without a court order would increase NSA's speed and\nagility. General Hayden stated that after two additional meetings with the\nVice President, the Vice President asked him to work with his Counsel,\nDavid Addington.\n\n(U) Presidential Authorization Drafted and Signed\n(TS//SI//OR/NF) According to General Hayden, the Vice President's\nCounsel, David Addington, drafted the first Authorization. General\nHayden described himself as the \"subject matter expert\" but stated that no\nother NSA personnel participated in the drafting process, including the\nGeneral Counsel. He also said that Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrepresentatives were not involved in any of the discussions that he attended\nand he did not otherwise inform them.\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden said he was \"surprised with a s m a l l ' s ' \"\nwhen the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, and that it only\nchanged the location from which N S A could collect communications.\nRules for minimizing U.S. person information still had to be followed.\n\n(U//FOUO) SIGINT Activity Authorized by the President\n(TS//SI//OR/NF) On 4 October 2001, the President delegated authority\nthrough the Secretary of Defense to the Director of N S A to conduct\nspecified electronic surveillance on targets related to Afghanistan and\ninternational terrorism for 30 days. Because the surveillance included wire\nand cable communications carried into or out of the United States, it would\notherwise have required FISC authority.\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) The Authorization allowed NSA to conduct four types\nof collection activity:\n[k] Telephony content\n@ Internet content\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n0\n\nTelephony metadata\n\n(¥) Internet metadata\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A could collect the content and associated metadata of\ntelephony and Internet communications for which there was probable cause\nto believe that one of the communicants was in Afghanistan or that one\ncommunicant was engaged in or preparing for acts of international\nterrorism. In addition, N S A was authorized to acquire telephony and\nInternet metadata for communications with at least one communicant\noutside the United States or for which no communicant was known to be a\ncitizen of the United States. N S A was also allowed to retain, process,\nanalyze and disseminate intelligence from the communications acquired\nunder the authority.\n\n(U//FOUO) Subsequent Changes to the Authorization\n(TS//SI//NF) After the first Presidential authorization, the specific terms,\nwording, or interpretation of the renewals periodically changed. (See\nAppendix B for a completed listing of changes.)\n(TS//SI//NF) Domestic Collection. The wording of the first\nauthorization could have been interpreted to allow domestic content\ncollection where both communicants were located in the U.S. or were U.S.\npersons. General Hayden recalled that when the Counsel to the Vice\nPresident pointed this out, General Hayden told him that NSA would not\ncollect domestic communications because 1) N S A was a foreign intelligence\nagency, 2) N S A infrastructure did not support domestic collection, and 3) his\npersonal standard was so high that there would be no problem getting a\nFISC order for domestic collection.\n(TS//SI//NF) Afghanistan. In January 2002, after the Taliban was forced\nout of power, Afghanistan was no longer specifically identified in the\nAuthorization.\n(TS//SI//NF) Iraqi Intelligence Service. For a limited period of time\nsurrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the President authorized the use of\nPSP authority against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. On 28 March 2003,\nthe DCI determined that, based on then current intelligence, the Iraqi\nIntelligence service was engaged in terrorist activities and presented a\nthreat to U.S. interests in the United States and abroad. Through the\nDeputy DCI, Mr. Tenet received the President's concurrence that PSP\nauthorities could be used against the Iraqi Intelligence Service. N S A\nceased using the Authority for this purpose in March 2004.\n\nTOP\n\nSECRET//STLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) TWO: IMPLEMENTATION OF T H E A U T H O R I T Y A N D\nRESULTING S I G I N T PRODUCT\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden said that although he felt comfortable\nexercising the Presidential authorization and believed it to be legal, he\nrecognized that it was politically sensitive and controversial and would be\nsubjected to scrutiny at some point in time. He and NSA leadership strove\nto ensure that NSA personnel executed the terms of the Authorization with\ncare and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized.\nPSP-related operations began on 6 October. Early on, personnel worked\nunder the assumption that the Authorization was temporary and that\noperations would stop in the near future. After it became evident that the\nAuthority would be continuously renewed, management focused on\ndesigning processes and procedures for Program activity.\n\n(U//FOUO) Stand Up of Operations\n(TS//SI//NF) On 4 October 2001, after receiving the Authorization, General\nHayden informed the SIGINT Director and other key personnel of NSA's\nnew authorities and asked the N S A General Counsel if the Authorization\nwas legal. The General Counsel said that the next day, 5 October, he told\nGeneral Hayden that he believed it was legal (see Appendix D).\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Under General Hayden's direction, immediate steps were\ntaken to implement the temporary authority.\n0\n\nA 24-hour watch operation, the Metadata Analysis Center (MAC),\nwas created in the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID).\n\n0\n\nThe first Program Manager was identified and informed of his new\nresponsibilities.\n\nQjO A cadre of experienced operational personnel was chosen to\nimplement the Program.\n(¥] Office space was identified to accommodate newly assigned\npersonnel.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR\n\n\nCON/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n[x] A new security compartment with the temporary cover term\nS T A R B U R S T was established. 3\n[k) Fifty computer servers to store and process data acquired under the\nnew authority were ordered. 4\n@\n\nInitial funding of $25 million for PSP operations was obtained from\nthe DCI.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) On Saturday and Sunday, 6 and 7 October, small groups of\noperational personnel were called at h o m e and asked to report to work for\nspecial PSP clearance briefings.\n(TS//SI//OR/NF) On Monday, 8 October 2001, Columbus Day, General\nHayden briefed the analysts, programmers, and mathematicians that had\nbeen selected to implement the Authorization. At that briefing, General\nHayden said he did not share the specific content of the Authorization with\nattendees but relayed key information such as:\n[w] The Authorization came from the President.\n[w] The Authorization was temporary.\n[x] The Authorization w a s intended to be an early warning system of\nimpending terrorist attacks in the United States.\n0\n\nThe N S A General Counsel had reviewed the Authorization and\nconcluded that it was legal.\n\n0\n\nN S A would do exactly what the Authorization stated and \"not one\nelectron or photon more.\"\n\n(¥] The Authorization should be kept secret and it required strict\ncompartmentation.

On 11 October 2001, the Associate General\nCounsel for Operations and the N S A Deputy General Counsel were cleared\nfor the Program and agreed with the NSA General Counsel's determination\nthat the Authorization was legal. N S A OGC did not formally document its\nopinions or legal rationale (see Appendix D).\n(TS//SI-STLW//NF) The M A C was created to analyze metadata obtained\nunder PSP authorization. By 7 October 2001, it was a 24-hour 7-day a\nweek watch center with 20 analysts, reporters, and software developers\nworking in three shifts. Many M A C employees were former Russian traffic\nanalysts with manual call chaining analysis experience. Initially, the M A C\nreported directly to General Hayden and the Deputy Director. The M A C\nChief briefed the Director eveiy week, and the Deputy Director visited\nM A C spaces for a briefing each evening.\n(TS//SI//NF) While the M A C was setting up to analyze PSP metadata, the\nCounterterrorism (CT) Product Line was realigning to conduct PSP content\ntasking and analysis. The M A C and the CT Product Line worked closely\ntogether to coordinate efforts and share information. The CT Product Line\nwas growing rapidly as handpicked employees were moved to support the\nnew mission.\n(TS//SI//NF) Within 30 days, the PSP was fully operational. While\nawaiting delivery of requested computer servers, the FBI and CIA gave\nN S A lead telephone numbers, and the M A C was able to immediately chain\nwithin the United States with SIGINT collected overseas. Private sector\npartners began to send telephony and Internet content to NSA in October\n2001. They began to send telephony and Internet metadata to N S A as early\nas November 2001.\n\n(U//FOUO) On-Going Operations\n(TS//SI//NF) After operations began and it became evident that the\nAuthorization was likely to be renewed indefinitely, NSA management\nbecame increasingly focused on designing processes and procedures to\nimplement the Program effectively and to ensure compliance with the\nAuthorization.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U) Organizational\n\nStructure\n\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A conducted all PSP analysis and reporting at its\nheadquarters at Ft. Meade, Maiyland, within the S I G I N T Directorate.\nSpecifically, tasking approvals, analysis, and reporting were conducted in\nthe C T Product Line within SID, Analysis and Production. Collection of\ndata w a s managed in SID, Directorate for Acquisition. N o PSP activities\nwere managed at N S A field sites.\n[OIG will insert high level SID org chart from 2001 here]\n(TS//SI//NF) Although the formal chain of c o m m a n d for SIGINT\noperations w a s through SID, in practice, the Director and Deputy Director\nof N S A / C S S managed the Program while keeping the S I G I N T Director\ninformed. Over time, the SIGINT Director became more involved, but the\nDirector and Deputy Director always maintained direct operational control.\n(TS//SI//NF) P r o g r a m Manager. Five officials held the Program\nManager position over the life of the PSP. 5 Initially, the Program Manager\nreported to the Chief of the C T Product Line. In 2004, the Program\nManager position was restructured as the SID Program Manager for CT\nSpecial Projects and elevated to report to the S I G I N T Director. This\nallowed the Program Manager jurisdiction of PSP elements across SID, not\nj u s t those within the Directorate for Analysis and Production. At that time,\nthe position was also formally designated as a senior level civilian position.\nA small staff w a s added to form the Program M a n a g e m e n t Office.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) SID Analysis and Production. Initially, the MAC\nanalyzed PSP metadata (data that describes the content, events, or networks\nassociated with SIGINT targets), while S I G I N T Development in the C T\nProduct Line analyzed non-PSP metadata. The C T Product Line performed\nPSP content analysis. SIGINT Development, a separate organization\nwithin the SID, managed approvals for content tasking. In 2004, the\nanalysis and production of metadata and content were consolidated into a\nn e w organization called the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD). A A D\nw a s divided into three teams: internet metadata, telephony metadata, and\ncontent.\n(TS//SI//NF) Coordination with FBI and CIA. By 2004, four FBI\nintegrees and two CIA integrees, operating under S I G I N T authorities in\naccordance with written agreements, were co-located with N S A PSP-\n\n\n(TS//SI//NF) The Chief of the CT Product Line was Acting Program Manager for a brief time in 2004.\n\nTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\ncleared analysts. The purpose of co-locating these individuals w a s to\nimprove collaborative analytic efforts.\n(TS//SI//NF) SID Data Acquisition. Through the life of the Program,\ndata collection was managed by Special Source Operations in SID, Data\nAcquisition Directorate. Collection managers were responsible for putting\ntelephone numbers and email selectors on PSP-authorized collection by\nprivate sector companies and taking them off collection.\n\n(U) Metadata\n(TS//SI//NF) The authority to collect bulk telephony and Internet metadata\nsignificantly enhanced N S A ' s ability to identify activity that may have been\nterrorist-related. Contact chaining is the process of building a network\ngraph that models the communication (e-mail, telephony, etc.) patterns of\ntargeted entities (people, organizations, etc) and their associates from the\ncommunications sent or received by the targets. 6 Metadata is data that\ndescribes other data, specifically information that describes the content,\nevents or networks associated with S I G I N T targets. For example, for an\nemail message, it would include the sender and recipient email addresses.\nIt does not contain the subject line or the text of the email; they are\nconsidered to be content. Likewise, for a telephone conversation, metadata\nwould include the called number and the calling number as well as the\nduration of the call.\n(TS//SI//NF) Although N S A had the capability to collect bulk telephony\nand Internet metadata prior to the PSP, its application w a s limited because\nN S A did not have the authority to collect communications in which one\nend (the number being called or the recipient address of an e-mail) was in\nthe United States. PSP significantly increased the data available to N S A\nanalysts and allowed them to create more thorough contact chaining. This\ngave N S A the key to an early warning system—the ability to identify\nindividuals in the United States or individuals outside the U.S. using U.S.\ntelecommunications structures in contact with a foreign target, a terrorist.\n(TS//SI//NF) Because metadata was not constitutionally protected, N S A\ndid not consider it to be as sensitive as content collection. Nevertheless,\nprocesses were set up to document requests for metadata analysis and\njustifications for conducting such analysis under Program authority. The\n\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Additional chaining can be performed on the associates' contacts to determine patterns in\nthe way a network of targets may communicate. Additional degrees of separation from the initial target are\nreferred to as \"hops.\" For example a direct contact is one hop away from the target. A contact of the direct\ncontact would be described as being 2 hops away from the target. The resulting contact-graph is subsequently\nanalyzed for intelligence and to develop potential investigative leads.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nfollowing describes the process used to obtain requests, conduct analysis,\nand report results under the PSP. (See Appendix E for a flowchart of the\nend-to-end process.)\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Requests for Information and Leads. Contact chaining\nanalysis requests were received from FBI, CIA, or NSA. Requests\ntypically took one of two forms, Requests for Information (RFI) and Leads.\nRFIs were specific questions about a target's telephone numbers or email\naddresses, called \"selectors\" at NSA. Leads were more general requests\nabout a target's contacts. Requestors submitted leads to discover new\ninvestigative leads. Contact chaining requests were documented from the\ninception of the PSP.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Approvals to Chain. Prior to chaining, N S A\ncounterterrorism shift coordinators reviewed chaining requests to\ndetermine whether they met criteria provided by the OGC and based on the\nterms of the Authorization. They had to have enough information to\nidentify a terrorism nexus and demonstrate compliance with criteria\nrequired by the Authorization before analysis could begin. Shift\ncoordinators either approved requests, approved them for 1-hop (direct\ncontact) analysis, or denied them. Approved requests were passed to\nanalysts for contact chaining.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Analysis. NSA used a variety of tools to conduct\nmetadata analysis and view the results. NSA's primary tool for conducting\nmetadata analysis, for PSP and traditional SIGINT collection, was\nMAINWAY. MAINWAY was used for storage, contact chaining, and for\nanalyzing large volumes of global communications metadata. At the\nbeginning of the PSP, only the \"SIGINT Navigator\" tool was available to\nview MAINWAY output. Over time, new tools and new processes, such as\nautomated chaining alerting, were created to improve analysts' efficiency.\nTo obtain the most complete results, analysts used data collected under PSP\nand non-PSP authorities. Typically, they analyzed networks with two\ndegrees of separation (two hops) from the target. Analysts determined if\nresulting information was reportable.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) In addition, an automated chaining alert process was\ncreated to alert analysts of new potentially reportable selectors. Previously\napproved selectors were compared to incoming MAINWAY data\nauthorized by the PSP, E.O. 12333, or the FISC. Alerts of direct contacts\nwith approved selectors were reported to N S A analysts for further analysis\nand potential reporting to FBI and CIA.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//NF) Storage. N S A stored metadata obtained under PSP\nauthorities in a protected database. Only cleared and trained analysts were\ngiven access to PSP metadata.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Reporting. Reports based on metadata analysis were\ntypically referred to as \"tippers.\" Tippers contained contact chaining\nanalysis results relevant to terrorism or with potential links to terrorism that\nwarranted the attention of the FBI or the CIA for further investigation.\nBefore releasing reports with U.S. person information, analysts obtained\npermission to do so in accordance with established N S A dissemination\nprocedures.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) For each published report, NSA retained documentation\nof the analysis, supporting RFI or lead information, and a justification\nstatement explaining the link to terrorism. If a report was not published,\ndocumentation was not retained. Counterterrorism personnel manually\nupdated information in a computer tracking system to reflect the\ndisposition of chaining requests.\n\n(U) Content\n(TS//SI//NF) Collection and analysis of content is NSA's traditional wav of\nreporting means of conducting SIGINT. Content generally refers to words\nspoken during a telephone conversation or the written text of an email\nmessage. NSA collection of the content of telephony and Internet\ncommunications under the PSP improved its ability to produce intelligence\non terrorist-related activity. For example, by allowing N S A access to links\ncarrying communications with one end in the United States, NSA\nsignificantly increased its access to transiting foreign communications, i.e.,\nwith both communicants outside the United States. General Hayden\ndescribed this as \"the real gold of the Program.\" And, by allowing the\nintercept of international communications, N S A was able to identify threats\nwithin the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) From the start of the Program until January 2007, N S A issued\n490 reports based on PSP-derived content information. Also, as shown\nbelow, approximately 37,664 telephony and Internet selectors were tasked\nfor\nPSP-authorized content collection during that time period. Only 8 percent\nwere U.S. targets. The vast majority\n(92 percent) were foreign.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF)\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nApproximate Number of Selectors Targeted for PSP Content Collection\n4 Oct 2001 to 17 Jan 2007\n\n*\n\nU.S. Telephony\n\n(TS//SI//OC/NF)\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A leadership considered selectors for targets located in the\nUnited States to be extremely sensitive. As such, processes were set up to\nensure strict compliance with the terms of the Authorization. The\nfollowing describes the general process for tasking, collecting, storing and\nreporting telephony and Internet content under the PSP. (See Appendix F\nfor a flowchart of the end-to-end process.)\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) Tasking Approvals. Under the PSP, each domestic\nselector tasked for content collection was formally approved and tracked.\nAnalysts submitted content collection requests, also called tasking\npackages, to the Chief of CT for approval. Tasking packages contained a\nnarrative analysis, conclusion, supporting information, documentation, and\na checklist of package contents. In the Chief's absence, the Deputy Chief\nof CT or the Program Manager could approve the requests. The approving\nofficials reviewed the tasking packages to ensure that the proposed target\nand related metadata selectors met criteria in the Authorization. If criteria\nwere not met, the officials requested additional information or denied the\nrequest. In limited cases, collection was approved for specific time\nperiods. If the content contained foreign intelligence, the time period for\ncollection would be extended. If it did not, collection was stopped. All\napprovals were documented in tasking packages.\n\nTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//NF) Foreign selectors tasked for PSP content collection did not\nrequire formal approvals or tasking packages. Analysts were responsible\nfor determining whether a foreign selector met the criteria for foreign\nintelligence terms of the Authorization.\n(TS//SI//NF) Collection. After a domestic selector was approved for PSP\ncontent collection, it was identified as \"tasked\" in the STELLARWIND\nAddresses Database by CT/AAD tasking managers who then emailed a\ncollection tasking request to the SSO Collection Manager for telephony\nand Internet content collection. Foreign selector content collection\nrequests were sent directly to the SSO Collection Manager. They did not\nrequire special approval.\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) SSO collection managers were responsible for\nensuring that telephony and Internet content selectors were put on or taken\noff collection. For telephony telephony content selectors, collection\nmanagers sent content collection tasking instructions to private sector\ncompanies. Private sector companies were responsible for implementing\ntasking at front-end devices to obtain the required content collection. For\nInternet content selectors, collection managers sent content tasking\ninstructions directly to equipment installed at\ncompany-controlled locations. Collected data was sent back to NSA/SSO\nand made available to analysts through the HYBRID voice processing\nsystem for telephony content selectors or the PINWALE database for\nInternet content selectors. SSO collection managers worked with private\nsector companies and the CT Product Line to ensure that collected data was\nas intended and legally authorized.\n(TS//SI//NF) storage. Content (voice or dOata) collected under PSP was\nstored in protected partitions in existing NSA databases. Access to the\npartitions was restricted to PSP-cleared personnel.\n(TS//SI//NF) Reporting. After analyzing content data collected under\nPresidential authority and identifying foreign intelligence information,\ncounterterrorism analysts wrote reports. After an initial review within the\nCT Product Line, some reports were sent to SID Oversight and Compliance\n(O&C) for a second review for U.S. person identities. O&C reviewers\ndetermined whether the U.S. identities in the report were necessary to\nassess or understand the foreign intelligence information being reported or\nwas required within the conduct of recipient's official duties . If an identity\nwas found to be unnecessary, it was not reported. Before any U.S. person\ninformation was disseminated in reporting, internal NSA approvals were\nobtained as required by United States Signals Intelligence\nDirective\n\nSP0018 - Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR\n\n\nCON/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) Initially, NSA responded to FBI and CIA information\nrequests in encrypted email. These initial reports, sometimes called\n\"Tippers\" or \"Snippets,\" were \"hidden in plain sight,\" meaning the\ninformation in the report did not reveal the source of the information.\nLater, FBI and CIA wanted to understand how NSA knew certain\ninformation that could not be provided in normal reporting channels.\nEventually, \"tear line\" reporting was established. Tear lines are used\nregularly by N S A as a way to report SIGINT-derived information and\nsanitized information in the same report to appropriately cleared\nindividuals. The sanitized \"tear line\" information conveys the same basic\nfacts as the COMINT-controlled information while hiding COMINT as the\nsource.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Dissemination of S I G I N T Product\n(TS//SI//NF) Regardless of which organization submitted requests or leads\nto NSA, all resulting reports were sent to CIA and FBI. Reports answered\nspecific RFI questions or provided new investigative leads developed from\nchaining analysis. Reports contained selectors of interest (potential leads)\nwith potential terrorist connections, not full chaining results. NSA had\nminimal insight into how CIA and FBI used PSP products.\n\n(U) Discovery Requests\n(U) On occasion, the Department of Justice (DoJ) attorneys determine that\nthe facts of a particular matter justify a search of N S A files and submit a\nsearch request. In response to those requests or in response to discovery\norders, N S A conducts a search of its databases to locate records that may\nfall within the scope of DoJ's discovery obligations and Rule 16 of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Typically the search process begins\nwith a written request from DoJ including the names and aliases of\nindividuals. N S A attorneys work with personnel trained in the retrieval of\nN S A reports to craft search strategies reasonably designed to identify\nreporting that may be responsive to the request. These search strategies are\nthen used to perform electronic searches of N S A repositories of\ndisseminated foreign intelligence reports. All responsive reports, to the\nextent any exist, are made available for review by DoJ.\n(TS//SI) N S A searches only databases of reported intelligence and does not\nsearch databases containing acquired but not processed information (e.g.,\nraw traffic) or acquired and processed but not reported or disseminated\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\ninformation/communications (e.g., gists).

The\nfunds were given annually to SID for Project MAINWAY hardware and\ncontract support, analytic tools and contract analytic support, and\ncollaborative partnerships with private sector companies.

The original Authorization and renewals were kept\nin the NSA Director's safe, and access to the documents was tightly\ncontrolled. By January 2007, nearly 3,000 people had been briefed\non the PSP, including members of Congress and the FISC.\n\n(U) A c c e s s to Legal Reviews\n(TS//SI//NF) The NSA did not have access to the early DoJ Office of\nLegal Counsel (OLC) opinions supporting the Attorney General's\nstatement that the PSP was legal. General Hayden, NSA lawyers, and the\nNSA Inspector General agreed that it was not necessary for them to see the\nearly opinions in order to execute the terms of the Authorization, but felt it\nwould be helpful to do so. NSA was, however, given access and provided\ncomments to the OLC opinion issued in 2004.\n\n(U) Access to OLC's Original Legal Review\n(TS//SI//NF) Two NSA requests for access to the original OLC legal\nopinion were denied.\n(TS//SI//NF) First Request. NSA General Counsel Robert Deitz stated that\nhe asked the Vice President's Counsel if he could see the opinion. Even\nthough Mr. Deitz's request was denied, the Vice President's Counsel read a\nfew paragraphs of the opinion to him over the classified telephone line.\n(TS//SI//NF) Second Request. At a 8 December 2003 meeting with the\nDoJ Associate Deputy Attorney General to discuss collection of metadata\nand an upcoming NSA OIG compliance audit, NSA's IG and Deputy GC\nrequested to see the OLC legal opinion. The Counsel to the Vice President,\nwho unexpectedly attended the meeting, denied the request and said that\nany request to see the opinion had to come directly from General Hayden.\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden stated he never asked for or read the OLC\nlegal opinion supporting the PSP. The Deputy GC stated that it was his\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nunderstanding that the opinion was not shared with N S A because it was\nconsidered confidential legal advice to the President.\n(TS//SI//NF) The IG, GC, and Deputy GC agreed that their inability to read\nthe OLC opinion did not prevent or impair them from executing and\noverseeing the Program. They were able to determine legality of the\nProgram independently from DoJ (see Appendix D). However, the IG said\nthat he found the secrecy surrounding the legal rationale to be \"odd.\"\nSpecifically, he said that it was \"strange that N S A was told to execute a\nsecret program that everyone knew presented legal questions, without\nbeing told the underpinning legal theoiy.\" The IG, GC, and Deputy GC all\nstated that they had yet to see the full text of the original OLC opinion.\n\n(U//FOUO) Access to the May 2004 Opinion\n(U//FOUO) In 2003 and 2004, the DoJ Associate Deputy Attorney General\nand the O L C Assistant Attorney General visited N S A to receive briefings\non the PSP. On 04 May 2004, NSA, at the request of the OLC Assistant\nAttorney General, provided comments on the OLC's draft opinion on the\nLegality of the PSP. The OLC Assistant Attorney General submitted his\nopinion on 06 May 2004.\n\n(U//FOUO) A c c e s s to t h e Presidential Authorization\n(TS//SI//NF) As directed by the White House, access to the original\nPresidential authorization and subsequent renewals was tightly controlled.\n(C) The Vice President's Counsel drafted the Authorizations and personally\ndelivered them to NSA. On a few occasions, N S A picked up the\nAuthorization at the White House.\n(C) The first Authorization and subsequent renewals were kept in a safe in\nthe Director's office. Initially, access was limited to General Hayden and a\nfew others, including three OGC attorneys, Program Managers, and certain\noperational personnel. Those with access were not allowed to disseminate\nthe Authorizations.\n(TS//SI//NF) Importantly, most N S A operations personnel, including the\nChief of the CT Product Line, who approved tasking for content collection,\nwere not allowed to see the actual authorization. Rather, OGC answered\ntargeting, information sharing, and implementation legal questions on an\n\"on call\" basis for operators. When the Authorization changed, OGC\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nsummarized those changes in emails distributed to key program executives\nor communicated changes in due diligence meetings.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Such limited access to the Authorization was documented\nin an IG investigation as a primary cause of two early violations of the\nAuthorization. At the IG's recommendation, in March 2003, General\nHayden began issuing Delegation of Authority letters that explained the\nAuthorization as it applied to executing the Program. A new Delegation of\nAuthority was promulgated with each renewal of the Authorization. The\nDelegation of Authority letters were sent to the Program Manager and the\ntwo managers of the SID CT Product Line and not further disseminated.\n(See Section Six.)\n\n(U) A c c e s s to Program Information\n(TS//SI//STLW//NF) Between 4 October 2001 and 17 January 2007, NSA\ncleared over 3,000 people for the PSP.

This number included Senators\nRobert Graham and Richard Shelby, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi,\nPresident George W. Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney, Counsel to the\nVice President David Addington, and Presidential Assistant I. Lewis\n\"Scooter\" Libby. By 31 January 2002, FISC Judge Royce Lamberth was\ncleared. By June 2002, over 500 people had been cleared, including two\nadditional members of Congress, Senator Daniel Inouye and former\nSenator Theodore Stevens, as well as FISC Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.\nSee Appendix G for a list, by date, of the number of people briefed into the\nProgram.\n\n(U) Non-Operational Personnel\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Knowledge of the PSP was strictly limited at the express\ndirection of the White House. General Hayden, over time, delegated his\nPSP clearance approval authority for NSA, FBI, and CIA operational\npersonnel working the mission to the N S A PSP Program Manager. For\nmembers of Congress, FISC, outside counsel for providers, and the NSA\nIG, General Hayden had to obtain approval from the White House.\n(U//FOUO) From the start, General Hayden and N S A leadership pushed to\nkeep members of the legislative and judicial branches of government\ninformed. General Hayden said he told the Vice President that he had no\n\nTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nconcerns about the lawfulness of the Authorization but worried about the\npolitics. After some hesitancy, the White House gave General Hayden\npermission to brief certain members of Congress. In addition, the Chief\nJudge of the FISC was first cleared in January 2002 (see Section\n).\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Interactions with Members of Congress. Between 25\nOctober 2001 and 17 January 2007, General Hayden, sometimes supported\nby operational target experts from the CT Product Line and SSO office,\nconducted over 49 briefings to members of Congress or their staff. (See\nAppedix\nfor a complete list of briefings.)\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden first briefed the following members of\nCongress on 25 October 2001:\n[¥] Chair - House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\n®\n\nRanking Minority Member of the House Permanent Select\nCommittee on Intelligence\n\n[¥) Chair - Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n0\n\nVice Chair - Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n(TS//SI//NF) In addition, N S A received and responded to a variety of\nProgram-related inquiries from members of Congress, including Senators\nInouye, Stevens, Pelosi, and Rockefeller.\n(U//FOUO ) General Hayden always believed that the PSP was legal. He\nsaid that during the many PSP-related briefings he gave to members of\nCongress, no one ever said that NSA should stop what it was doing. He\nemphasized that he did not just \"flip through slides\" during the briefings.\nThey lasted as long as attendees desired.\n(TS//SI//NF) Interactions with the FISC. On 31 Januaiy 2002, Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth was briefed on the PSP and on 17 May 2002, his\nsuccessor, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, was briefed. A law clerk was also\nbriefed in April 2004. (See Section Five.)\n\n(U//FOUO) The Clearance Process\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) N S A managed the NSA clearance process. Clearance\nrequests were submitted to the PSP Program Office for Program Manager\napproval or disapproval. Access was granted only to those who needed it\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR\n\n\nCON/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nto perform assigned job duties. The Program Manager questioned access\nrequests with unclear justifications. Approved requests were forwarded to\nthe Program security officer, who performed a security check. If the\nsecurity check yielded nothing to impede access, individuals were\ninstructed to go to the security office to read the \"Security Pre-Brief\nAgreement\" and sign a \"Sensitive Compartmented Information\nNondisclosure Agreement\" form. NSA's General Counsel also had the\nauthority to read in Attorneys from other agencies.\n(TS//SI//NF) On 20 May 2005, the Program Manager changed the PSP\nclearance request and re-certification process. The Project Security Officer\nassigned to Special Source Operations in the SIGINT Directorate assumed\nresponsibility for the PSP clearance process. (Special Source Operations\nmanaged all PSP-related collection for NSA.) Additionally, the Program\nManager initiated monthly PSP clearance briefings.\n(TS//SI//NF) From 4 October 2001 until 23 May 2005, a two-level PSP\nclearance structure was used. One level was limited to the \"fact o f '\nProgram existence. A second level included access to PSP targeting data\nthrough a \"must know\" principle. Access lists were maintained in the SSO\nSecurity Director's office on an internal SSO compartmented LAN.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Regular zero-based reviews were conducted by the SSO\nSecurity Director's office quarterly to validate that cleared individuals had\na continuing need for access to PSP information. The clearance did not\nautomatically transfer with individuals who moved to new assignments.\nThe clearance had to be re-justified for the new position, or the individual\nwould be debriefed from the Program.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) FOUR: NSA PRIVATE SECTOR RELATIONSHIPS\n(TS//SI//NF) To conduct foreign intelligence-gathering activities\nunder the PSP, NSA required the assistance of private companies,\nwhich provided access to international communications chokepoints\nin United States. Immediately after 11 September 2001, some private\ncompanies contacted NSA to offer support. Subsequent to PSP\nauthorization, NSA sent request letters to companies stating that\ntheir assistance was authorized by the President with legal\nconcurrence of the Attorney General.\n\n(U) Need for Private Sector Cooperation\n(TS//SI//NF) The United States carries out foreign intelligence activities\nthrough a variety of means. One of the most effective means is to partner\nwith commercial entities to obtain access to information that would not\notherwise be available.\n\n(U//FOUO) Telephony\n(TS//SI//NF) Most international telephone calls are routed through a small\nnumber of switches or \"chokepoints\" in the international telephone\nswitching system en route to their final destination. The United States is a\nmajor crossroads for international switched telephone traffic. For example,\nin 2003, circuit switches worldwide carried approximately 180 billion\nminutes of telephone communications. Twenty percent of this amount,\nover 37 billion minutes, either originated or terminated in the United\nStates, and another thirteen percent, over 23 billion minutes, transited the\nUnited States (neither originating nor terminating here). [NSA is\nauthorized under Executive Order 12333 to acquire transiting telephone\ncalls.]\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A determined that under the Authorization it could gain\naccess to approximately 81 % of the international calls into and out of the\nUnited States through three corporate partners: COMPANY A had access to\n39%, COMPANY B 28%, and COMPANY C 14%. N S A did not seek\nassistance from local exchange carriers, because that would have given\nN S A access primarily to domestic calls.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U//FOUO) Internet Communications\n(TS//SI//NF) A1 Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations have made\nextensive use of the Internet. It is their preferred method of\ncommunication. Terrorists use Internet communications, particularly webbased services, because they are ubiquitous, anonymous, and usually free\nof charge. They can access Web-based email accounts and similar services\nfrom any origination point around the world.\n(TS//SI//NF) The United States is a major Internet communications hub.\nThe industry standard for characterization of the volume of Internet\ncommunications is bandwidth, which measures the amount of digital data\ntransmitted in one second - bits per second or bps. For example, data\navailable from 2002 shows that at that time, worldwide international\nbandwidth w a s slightly more than 290 Gbps 7 . O f that total, less than 2.5\nGbps w a s between two regions that did not include the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) The United States is also h o m e to computer servers providing\nInternet communications services often used by terrorists. The majority of\nknown terrorist email addresses that N S A has tracked are hosted on U.S.based providers or foreign-managed providers hosted on servers in the\nUnited States.\n\n(U//FOUO) Evolution of NSA Partnerships w i t h Private S e c t o r\n(U) History of NSA Partnerships with Private Sector\n(TS//SI//NF) A s far back as World War II, N S A has had classified\nrelationships with carefully vetted U.S. companies that assist with essential\nforeign intelligence-gathering activities. N S A maintains relationships with\nover 100 U.S. companies. Without their cooperation, N S A would not be\nable respond to intelligence requirements on a variety of topics important\nto the United States.\n(TS//SI//NF) Two of the most productive SIGINT collection partnerships\nthat N S A has with the private sector are with C O M P A N Y A and\nC O M P A N Y B. These two relationships enable N S A to access large\nvolumes of foreign-to-foreign communications transiting the United States\n\n(U) Gpbs is an abbreviation for Gigabits per second, which can also be described as one billion bits per second\nor 1,000,000,000 bps.\n\nTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nthrough fiber-optic cables, gateway switches, and data networks. They also\nprovide foreign intelligence authorized under the FISA.\n(TS//SI//NF) According to General Alexander, General Hayden's\nreplacement as Director of NSA/CSS, if the relationships with these\ncompanies were ever terminated, the U.S. SIGINT system would be\nirrevocably damaged, because NSA would have sacrificed America's home\nfield advantage as the primaiy hub for worldwide telecommunications.\n\n(U) Partnerships after 11 September 2001\n(TS//SI//NF) According to the former Deputy Chief of SSO, between 11\nSeptember 2001 and the 4 October 2001 Authorization, COMPANY A and\nCOMPANY B contacted NSA and asked \"what can we do to help?\"\nCOMPANY B personnel approached N S A SSO personnel through an\nexisting program. They said they noticed odd patterns in domestic calling\nrecords surrounding the events of 11 September and offered call records\nand analysis. With no appropriate authority under which to accept the call\nrecords, N S A suggested the company contact the FBI.\n\n(U//FOUO) Partnerships Supporting t h e PSP\n(TS//SI//NF) Once the Authorization was signed on 4 October 2001, N S A\nbegan a process of identifying and visiting commercial entities requesting\ntheir support. While requesting help from corporate entities to support the\nPSP, N S A personnel made it clear that the PSP was a cooperative program\nand participation was voluntary. N S A knew that the PSP was an\nextraordinary program and understood if companies viewed it as too much\nof a liability.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA Approaches to Private Sector Companies\n(TS//SI//NF) 2001: On Columbus Day, 8 October 2001, N S A Special\nSource Operations (SSO) personnel responsible for the access relationships\nwith corporate partners COMPANY A, COMPANY B, and COMPANY C\nwere called in to work and informed that the President had authorized the\nPSP on 4 October 2001. The SSO personnel were tasked with initiating a\ndialog with the respective TS/SCI-cleared officials from COMPANIES A,\nB, and C to seek their cooperation under the new Authorization. Over the\nnext few business days, SSO personnel met separately with officials from\nthe three companies. Each company agreed to cooperate.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n29\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(TS//SI//NF) Upon confirmation that formal NSA letters requesting their\nassistance were forthcoming, the providers, acting independently and\nofficially unaware of the cooperating agreements with other companies,\ninitiated collection to support the PSP.\n(TS//SI//NF) 2002: In early 2002, NSA SSO personnel met with the Senior\nVice President of Government Systems and other employees from\nCOMPANY E. Under the authority of the PSP, N S A asked COMPANY E\nto provide call detail records (CDR) in support of security for the 2002\nOlympics in Salt Lake City. On 11 February 2002, the company's CEO\nagreed to cooperate with NSA. On 19 February 2002, COMPANY E\nsubmitted a written proposal that discussed methods it could use to\nregularly replicate call record information stored in a COMPANY E facility\nand potentially forward the same information to NSA. Discussions with\nCOMPANY E continued in 2003. However, the COMPANY E General\nCounsel ultimately decided not to support NSA.\n(TS//SI//NF) On 5 September 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with internet provider COMPANY D's General Counsel to discuss the\nPSP and ask for the company's support. COMPANY D provided support,\nbut it was minimal. (For a description of COMPANY D's support, see\npage\n, \"What Providers Furnished.\").\n(TS//SI//NF) On 29 October 2002, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with internet provider COMPANY F's Legal and Corporate Affairs\npersonnel, and a former NSA OGC employee hired by COMPANY F as\nindependent counsel. NSA requested COMPANY F's support under the\nPSP for email content. At the meeting, COMPANY F requested a letter\nfrom the Attorney General certifying the legality of the PSP. In December\n2002, NSA's Commercial Technologies Group was informed that the\ncompany's CEO agreed to support the PSP. According to NSA's General\nCounsel, COMPANY F did not participate in the PSP because of corporate\nliability concerns.\n(TS//SI//NF) 2003: In April 2003, NSA legal and operational personnel\nmet with the President and Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel, and\nother personnel from private sector COMPANY G. After the meeting, the\ncompany's General Counsel wanted to seek the opinion of outside counsel.\nNSA determined the risk associated with additional disclosure outweighed\nwhat COMPANY G would have provided. NSA decided to not pursue a\npartnership with this company.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n30\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U//FOUO) NSA Letters to Private Sector\n(TS//SI//NF) The Director sent letters to private sector companies\nrequesting their assistance with the PSP. NSA OGC drafted the letters for\nthe Director, tracked each renewal of the President's_authorization and\nmodified the letters accordingly, and ensured the letters were delivered to\nthe companies. Between 16 October 2001 and 14 December 2006, NSA\nsent 147 request-for-assistance letters to private sector partners.\n\n[U\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nCOMPANY\nCOMPANY\nCOMPANY\nCOMPANY\nCOMPANY\n\nA:\n44 Letters\nB:\n44 Letters\nC:\n46 Letters\nD: 11 Letters\nE:\n2 Letters\n\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2001. In his first PSP-related letter on 16 October 2001\nto COMPANIES A, B and C, General Hayden stated that the National\nSecurity Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation required their\nassistance \"to collect intelligence vital to the national security arising from\nthe events of 11 September 2001,\" and specifically requested that they\n\"provide survey, tasking and collection against international traffic, some\nof which terminates in the United States; provide aggregated call record\ninformation; and supply computer to computer data which can be used to\ndetermine the communicants.\" Their assistance was \"needed to identify\nmembers of international terrorist cells in the United States and prevent\nfuture terrorist attacks against the United States.\" These first letters also\nstated that the requested assistance was authorized by the President with\nthe legal concurrence of the Attorney General, pursuant to Article II of the\nConstitution.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2002: Subsequent letters were sent to COMPANIES A,\nB, and C by General Hayden (or his deputy) each time the President\nreauthorized the PSP. Throughout 2002, these written requests for\nassistance referenced the 16 October letter; repeated the need to provide\nthe Presidentially-authorized assistance; emphasized that such assistance\nwas necessary to counter a future terrorist attack; and stated that such\nassistance was reviewed by the Attorney General and had been determined\nto be a lawful exercise of the President's powers as Commander-in-Chief.\nStarting in mid-2003, the wording of the letters was revised but in\nsubstance remained the same.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Two request letters for assistance were sent to private\nsector COMPANY E.

All letters were signed by\nGeneral Hayden.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) In addition to the letters sent to COMPANY A,\nCOMPANY B, COMPANY C and COMPANY E, eleven request letters for\nassistance were prepared for internet provider COMPANY D. The first\nletter was on 9 October 2002 and the last letter was 11 September 2003.\nAll letters were signed by General Hayden or his designee.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2003: In June 2003, COMPANY C's General Counsel\nand Chief of Staff requested a written Attorney General opinion on the\nlegality and lawfulness of the PSP, to include a directive to comply.\nCOMPANY C cited corporate liability concerns as their reason. On 8\nAugust 2003, the Attorney General sent COMPANY C a letter stating that\nthe request for support was a lawful exercise of authorities assigned to the\nPresident under Article II of the Constitution. Additionally, the Attorney\nGeneral directed COMPANY C to comply with NSA's request.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2004: On 26 March 2004, the President amended his 11\nMarch 2004 authorization after deciding to discontinue bulk collection of\nInternet metadata. Before 11 March 2004, all authorizations covering\nInternet metadata collection (as well as content collection and telephony\nmetadata collection) were approved for form and legality by the Attorney\nGeneral. Accordingly, NSA's 12 March 2004 letters to the companies\nstated that the most recent authorization had been approved for form and\nlegality by the Counsel to the President, not the Attorney General as with\nprevious authorizations.\n(TS//SI//ECI//NF) 2005: Beginning 19 September 2005 through 14\nDecember 2006, new NSA/CSS Director General Alexander, or his\ndesignee, signed the request letters to the companies.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2006 Attorney General Letters. On 24 Januaty 2006,\nthe Attorney General sent letters to COMPANIES A, B, and C, certifying\nunder 18 U.S.C. 251 l(2)(a)(ii)(B) that \"no warrant or court order was or is\nrequired by law for the assistance, that all statutory requirements have been\nmet, and that the assistance has been and is required.\"\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) 2006 DNI Letters. On 13 April 2006, the Director of\nNational Intelligence (DNI) sent letters to Companies A, B, and C to\nunderscore the continuing critical importance of their assistance.

COMPANY B sometimes picked up its\nletters at NSA Headquarters. Letters for COMPANY D were stored at NSA\nsince no one at the company had the proper clearance to store them.\n\n(U//FOUO) PSP Authorized Support to NSA\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Private sector companies provided assistance to NSA\nunder the PSP in three categories: telephone and Internet Protocol content,\nMetadata from Call Detail Records, and Internet Protocol Metadata.\n(TS//ECI//NF) The PSP allowed content to be collected if the selected\ncommunication was one-end foreign or the location of the communicants\ncould not be determined. Selectors (email addresses and telephone\nnumbers) were provided by NSA's Office of Counterterrorism.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Content: Telephony. Under the PSP, companies\nprovided the content of one-end-foreign international telephone calls\n(telephony content) and the content of electronic communications (email\ncontent) of al Qaeda and its affiliates. COMPANIES A, B, and C provided\ntelephony content from communications links they owned and operated.\nThey had been providing telephony content to NSA before 2001 under\nFISA and E.O. 12333 authorities. NSA began to receive telephony content\nfrom COMPANIES A and B on 6 October 2001 and COMPANY C on 7\nOctober 2001. This support ended on 17 January 2007.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Content: Internet Email. COMPANIES A, B, and C\nprovided access to the content of Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda-affiliate email\nfrom communication links they owned and operated. NSA received email\ncontent from COMPANY A as early as October 2001 until 17 January\n2007, from Company B beginning February-March 2002 through 17\nJanuary 2007, and from COMPANY C from April 2005 until 17 January\n2007. From April 2003 through November 2003, COMPANY D provided\na limited amount of email content under the PSP. It did not provide PSPrelated support after November 2003, but it did provide support under\nFISA.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Metadata from Call Detail Records. COMPANIES A\nand B provided Call Detail Records to NSA. The records were used by\nNSA Counter-Terrorism metadata analysts to perform call chaining and\nnetwork reconstruction between known al Qaeda and al Qaeda-affiliate\ntelephone numbers and previously unknown telephone numbers with which\nthey had been in contact. Providers generated Call Detail Records as a\nnormal course of doing business (e.g., billing purposes and traffic\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n33\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nengineering). Records included all call events from the companies' long\ndistance and international communication networks. The Call Detail\nRecords were aggregated as large files by TS/SCI-cleared groups at\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY B and forwarded, on an hourly or daily\nbasis, across classified communications circuits to a PSP-restricted NSA\ndata repository.\nCOMPANY A provided PSP-authorized CDRs as early as November 2001,\nand COMPANY B began to provide CDRs in February 2002. Both\ncontinued to provide this support through the end of the PSP, and support\ncontinues today under the FISC Business Records Order. COMPANY C\nprovided select PSP-authorized CDRs from December 2002 through March\n2003.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) Internet Metadata. The last category of private sector\nassistance was access to Internet Protocol (IP) metadata associated with\ncommunications of al Qaeda (and affiliates) from data links owned or\noperated by COMPANIES A, B, and C. In order to be a candidate for PSP\nIP metadata collection, data links were first vetted to ensure that the\npreponderance of communications was from foreign sources, and that there\nwas a high probability of collecting al Qaeda (and affiliate)\ncommunications. NSA took great care to ensure that metadata was\nproduced against foreign, not domestic, communications.\n(TS//SI-ECI//NF) COMPANY A began providing PSP IP metadata\ncollection as early as November 2001. Although COMPANY B began\nproviding CD-ROMs of PSP IP metadata in October 2001, an automated\ntransfer of data was not available until February-March 2002. The\nPresidential authority to collect IP metadata was terminated in March 2004.\nCOMPANY A and COMPANY B IP metadata collection resumed after the\nFISC Pen Register/Trap & Trace (PR/TT) Order authorizing this activity\nwas signed on 15 July 2004. COMPANY C provided IP metadata\nbeginning in April 2005.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n34\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nThis page intentionally left blank.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n35\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) FIVE: NSA'S I N T E R A C T I O N W I T H T H E FISC A N D\nT R A N S I T I O N TO COURT ORDERS\n(TS//SI//NF) Until 2006, NSA's PSP-related interaction with members of\nthe FISC was limited to informational briefings to the Chief Judge. Chief\nJudge Royce Lamberth, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who replaced Judge\nLamberth as Chief Judge in May 2002, and one law clerk were the only\nmembers of the FISC that NSA had briefed on the PSP. In the spring of\n2004, NSA's interaction with Judge Kollar-Kotelly increased as NSA and\nDoJ began transitioning PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders in 2004.\nIt was not until after parts of the PSP were publicly revealed in\nDecember 2005 that all members of the FISC were briefed on the\nProgram.\n\n(U) NSA's Interaction with the FISC\n(TS//SI//NF) General Hayden stated that from the start of the PSP, he and\nother N S A leaders recognized the importance of keeping all three branches\nof the Government informed of the Program and pressed the White House\nto do so.\n(TS//SI//NF) In all of its interactions, neither N S A nor DoJ presented\nbefore the FISC the factual and legal issues arising from the PSP in any\ncase or controversy. Therefore, the FISC did not express any view or\ncomment on the legality or illegality of the PSP.\n\n(U//FOUO) NSA Briefings on the PSP to Members of the FISC\n(TS//SI//NF) The White House first permitted NSA to brief the Chief Judge\nof the FISC in January 2002. General Hayden stated that on 31 January\n2002, he provided Judge Lamberth a veiy detailed PSP briefing, and the\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General in the DoJ OLC explained the\nProgram's legality. General Hayden stated that this briefing was prompted\nby a concern expressed by DOJ that PSP-derived information would be\nused in FISA applications\n(TS//SI//NF) On 17 May 2002, General Hayden briefed incoming Chief\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly, with Judge Lamberth in attendance, on the PSP.

Judge Kollar-Kotelly added that she was allowed to\nread the memorandum but not to retain it for study.\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A records show that Judge Kollar-Kotelly was briefed\nagain on 12 August 2002 at the White House. Although w e found no\ndocumentation of the purpose of the meeting or topics discussed, Judge\nKollar-Kotelly stated in the Januaiy 2005 letter to the Counsel for\nIntelligence Policy that, at her request, she was permitted to review the\nAuthorization of the PSP on that date.\n(TS//SI//NF) In response to a New York Times \"warrantless wiretapping\"\nstory published in December 2005, General Alexander briefed all FISC\nmembers on the PSP on 9 January 2006. 9\n\n(U) Transition of PSP Authorities to FISC Orders\n(TS//SI//NF) The transition of PSP-authorized activities to FISC orders\nwas precipitated by preliminary results of DoJ O L C legal review of the\ncomponents of the Program. In March 2004, O L C found three of the four\ntypes of collection authorized under the PSP to be legally supportable.\nHowever, it determined that, given the method of collection, bulk Internet\nmetadata was prohibited by the terms of FISA and Title III.10\nConsequently, the White House Counsel rather than the Attorney General\nsigned the 11 March 2004 Authorization.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) NSA Implements\nControversial\n11 March 2004 Authorization\n\n\n(TS//STLW//SI//OR/NF)Judge Scullin did not attend this briefing, but was later briefed on 31 January 2006.\nJudge Bates, a new judge, was briefed on 21 March 2006.\n°(TS//STLW//SI//OR/NF) OLC ultimately issued three opinions: 15 March 2004, 6 May 2004, and 16 July\n2004.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n37\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Until March 2004, NSA considered its\ncollection of bulk Internet metadata under the PSP to be\nlegal and appropriate. Specifically, NSA leadership,\nincluding OGC lawyers and the IG, interpreted the terms of\nthe Authorization to allow NSA to obtain bulk Internet\nmetadata for analysis because NSA did not actually\n\"acquire\" communications until specific communications\nwere selected. In other words, because the Authorization\npermitted NSA to conduct metadata analysis on selectors\nthat met certain criteria, it implicitly authorized NSA to\nobtain the bulk data that was needed to conduct the\nmetadata analysis.\n(TS//SI//NF) On 11 March 2004, General Hayden had to\ndecide whether NSA would execute the Authorization\nwithout the Attorney General's signature (IV-A/32-11).\nGeneral Hayden described a conversation in which David\nAddington asked, \"Willyou do it (IV-A/32-11)?\" At that time,\nGeneral Hayden also said that he asked Daniel Levin,\nCounsel to the Attorney General, in March 2004 if he\nneeded to stop anything he was doing. Mr. Levin said that\nhe did not need to stop anything (IV-A/32-7 and IV-A/32a7&8). After conferring with NSA operational and legal\npersonnel, General Hayden stated that he decided to\ncontinue the PSP because 1) the members of Congress he\nbriefed the previous day, 10 March, were supportive of\ncontinuing the Program, 2) he knew the value of the\nProgram, and 3) NSA lawyers had determined the Program\nwas legal.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Eight days later on 19 March 2004, the President rescinded the\nauthority to collect bulk Internet metadata and gave N S A one week to stop\ncollection and block access to previously collected bulk Internet metadata. N S A\ndid so on 26 March 2004. To close the resulting collection gap, DoJ and NSA\nimmediately began efforts to recreate this authority in what became the PR/TT\norder. By January 2007, the remaining three authorities had also been replicated in\nFISC orders: the Business Records (BR) Order, the Foreign Content Order, and the\n\nTOP SECRET//STL\n\nW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n38\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nDomestic Content Order. On 1 February 2007, the final Authorization was allowed\nto expire and was not renewed.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Transition of Internet Metadata Collection to Pen Register/Trap\nand Trace Order Authority\n(TS//SI//NF) According to NSA personnel, the decision to transition\nInternet metadata collection to a FISC order was driven by DoJ. At a\nmeeting on 26 March 2007, DoJ directed N S A representatives from OGC\nand SID to find a legal basis, using a FISC order, to recreate NSA's PSP\nauthority to collect bulk Internet metadata.\n(TS//SI//NF) After extensive coordination, DoJ and N S A devised the\nPR/TT theory to which the Chief Judge of the FISC seemed amenable.\nDoJ and N S A worked closely over the following months, exchanging\ndrafts of the application, preparing declarations, and responding to\nquestions from court advisers. NSA representatives explained the\ncapabilities that were needed to recreate the Authority, and DoJ personnel\ndevised a workable legal basis to meet those needs. In April 2004, N S A\nbriefed Judge Kollar-Kotelly and a law clerk because Judge Kollar-Kotelly\nwas researching the impact of using PSP-derived information in FISA\napplications. In May 2004, NSA personnel provided a technical briefing\non N S A collection of bulk Internet metadata to Judge Kollar-Kotelly. In\naddition, General Hayden said he met with Judge Kollar-Kotelly on two\nsuccessive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the on-going\nefforts.\n(TS//SI//NF) The FISC signed the first PR/TT order on 14 July 2004.\nAlthough N S A lost access to the bulk metadata from 26 March 2004 until\nthe order was signed, the order essentially gave NSA the same authority to\ncollect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP, except that it\nspecified the datalinks from which N S A could collect, and it limited the\nnumber of people that could access the data. The FISC continues to renew\nthe PR/TT approximately every 90 days.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Transition of Telephony Metadata Collection to the Business\nRecords Order\n(TS//SI//NF) According to N S A General Counsel Vito Potenza, the\ndecision to transition telephony metadata to the Business Records Order\nwas driven by a private sector company. After the New York Times article\nwas published in December 2005, Mr. Potenza stated that one of the PSP\nproviders expressed concern about providing telephony metadata to N S A\nunder Presidential Authority without being compelled. Although OLC's\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n39\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nM a y 2004 opinion states that N S A collection of telephony metadata as\nbusiness records under the Authorization w a s legally supportable, the\nprovider preferred to be compelled to do so by a court order.\"\n(TS//SI//NF) A s with the P R / T T Order, DoJ and N S A collaboratively\ndesigned the application, prepared declarations, and responded to questions\nfrom court advisers. Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT Order\nm a d e this process more efficient.\n(TS//SI//NF) The FISC signed the first Business Records Order on 24 May\n2006. The order essentially gave N S A the same authority to collect bulk\ntelephony metadata from business records that it had under the PSP. And,\nunlike the PRTT, there was no break in collection at transition. The order\ndid, however, limit the number of people that could access the data and\nrequired more stringent oversight by and reporting to DOJ. The FISC\ncontinues to renew the Business Records Order every 90 days or so. (See\nAppendix H.)\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Transition of Internet and Telephony Content Collection to the\nForeign and Domestic Content Orders\n(TS//SI//NF) According to N S A O G C , the transition of PSP content\ncollection to FISC orders w a s driven by DoJ. DoJ had contemplated a\ntransition in July 2004 when the F I S C ' s signing of the PR/TT order\nindicated its willingness to authorize PSP activities under court order.\nGiven this precedent, DoJ concluded the FISC might also accept content\ncollection. However, little progress was made until June 2005 when the\nDoJ O I P R with N S A O G C and SID representatives began researching the\nfeasibility of collecting PSP content under court order. In essence, D O J\nand N S A needed to find a legal theoiy that would allow N S A to add and\ndrop thousands of foreign targets for content collection. Because the law\nw a s more restrictive for content than metadata, N S A had serious\nreservations about whether it would be possible to find a workable solution\nusing a FISC order at that time, especially given the large number of\nselectors to be tasked and the complexity f r o m legal and operational\nperspectives. For example:\n\n\"(TS//STLW//SI//OR/NF) In addition to the telephony metdata that NSA was receiving from private sector\ncompanies as business records, it was also obtaining \"live\" telephony metadata from its own SIGINT\ncollection sources. It continued until mid-2005. (***We will include a reference to the corresponding\nnotification here.***)\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n40\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n0\n\n(TS//SI//NF) N S A risked losing flexibility in the means of\ncollection, given that facilities and collection accesses were\ncomplex and in constant flux.\n\n0\n\n(TS//SI//NF) In executing the P R / T T and Business Records Orders,\nthe F I S C ' s and DoJ's consistently increasing demands for\ninformation took N S A analysts away from target-related duties.\n\n@\n\n(TS//SI//NF) The process imposed by the FISA statute w a s not able\nto handle the large volume of N S A requests for FISC authorization\nneeded after\n11 September 2001.\n\n0\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Because O L C ' s May 2004 opinion found that the\nexisting Authorization for content collection was lawful, there was\nno pressing need to find an alternative legal vehicle.\n\n(TS//SI//NF) In a letter dated 21 Februaiy 2006, the N S A G C expressed the\naforementioned concerns, among others, to the Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral suggesting that:\n\" . . . . now might be the right time to seek substantial revisions to\nthe FISA. The purpose of the legislation was to protect the\nprivacy of U.S. persons who could be subjected to surveillance,\neither intentionally or incidentally. Twenty-seven years later, the\nUnited States Government finds itself obtaining FISA orders so\nthat it can carry out surveillance on foreign intelligence targets\nwho are outside the United States and, more often than not,\ncommunicating only with others outside the United States. This\nserves no U.S. person's privacy interests, was never anticipated by\nthe statute's drafters, and diverts valuable resources from the fight\nagainst terrorism. The FISA needs to be simplified and\nstreamlined.\"\n(TS//SI//NF) Ultimately, DoJ decided to pursue a FISC order for content\ncollection wherein the traditional FISA definition of a \"facility\" as a\nspecific telephone number or email address w a s changed to encompass the\ngateway or cable head that foreign targets use for communications.\nMinimization and probable cause standards would then be applied. A s\nwith the P R T T and Business Records orders, N S A collaborated with DoJ to\nprepare the application and declarations and provided the operational\nrequirements needed to continue effective surveillance.\n(TS//SI//NF) A f t e r 18 months of concerted effort and coordination, the\nFISC ultimately accepted the theory for foreign selectors but rejected it for\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n41\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\ndomestic selectors. Consequently, on 10 Januaiy 2007, the FISC signed\ntwo separate orders: the Foreign Content Order and the Domestic Content\nOrder.\n(TS//SI//NF) The Foreign Content Order negatively affected SIGINT\nexploitation. Most notably, the number of foreign selectors on collection\ndropped by 73 percent, from 11,000 selectors under PSP to 3,000 under the\norder. In addition, the administrative workload for NSA analysts to put\ncritical foreign selectors on collection was so burdensome that the order\nbecame operationally unsustainable. The order was eventually superseded\nby Congress' FISA modernization. It was temporarily replaced by the\nProtect America Act in August 2007 and then permanently replaced by the\nFISA Amendments Act in July 2008.\n(TS//SI//NF) The Domestic Content Order did not create a similar loss in\ncollection because so few domestic numbers were tasked at that time. It\ndid, however, slow operations because of the documentation required, and\nit took considerably longer to task under the order than under the PSP.\nOver time, the scope of the Domestic Content Order gradually decreased to\na single selector tasked for collection in January 2009. In January 2009,\nthe FBI, at NSA's request, assumed responsibility for the Domestic Content\nOrder and became the declarant before the FISC.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n42\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\n(U) SIX: NSA OVERSIGHT OF PSP S I G I N T A C T I V I T I E S\n(U//FOUO) NSA Office of General Counsel and SID, Oversight and\nCompliance provided oversight of NSA PSP activities from October 2001\nuntil January 2007. NSA OIG initiated PSP oversight in 2002.\n\n(U) Office of General Counsel\n(U//FOUO) The OGC was the first NSA organization with oversight\nresponsibilities to learn of the PSP, and it continued to provide significant\noversight over the life of the Program. The GC was briefed on 4 October\n2001, the day the Authorization was signed. On 6 October, he gave the\nDirector and Deputy Director talking points for briefing N S A personnel on\nthe new authority. The talking points included the fact that General\nHayden had instructed the GC and the lead attorney for operations to\nconduct routine review and oversight of PSP activities.\n(U//FOUO) The N S A Assistant General Counsel for Operations provided\nmost of the Program oversight before the OIG learned of the PSP in 2002.\nHe and his successors reviewed proposed target packages and rejected\nthose not compliant with the Authorization, answered questions, gave\nbriefings, reviewed program implementation, and coordinated programrelated issues with DoJ.\n\n(U) SIGINT Directorate\n(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Directorate Office of Oversight and Compliance\n(O&C) represents the Director NSA/CSS and the Signals Intelligence\nDirector in overseeing compliance with authorities that govern the\ncollection, production, and dissemination of intelligence by the National\nSecurity Agency. The Chief of O & C was briefed on the PSP on 10\nOctober 2001. Initially, O&C's ability to provide effective oversight was\nlimited by insufficient staffing and a lack of methodologies to provide\nmeaningful oversight of PSP collection. It, therefore, focused on\nidentifying problem areas while documenting program activity. It also\nhelped establish database partitions and assisted with data flow compliance\nissues to prevent uncleared personnel from seeing Presidentially-authorized\ncollection. Later, it reviewed justification statements for tasked selectors.\nAlso, it directed PSP-cleared SIGINT operations personnel to follow\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR\n\n43\n\nCON/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\nestablished procedures for the dissemination of U.S. person information\nand obtained approvals to permit dissemination of U.S. person information\n\n(U) Office of Inspector General\n(U//FOUO) NSA OIG conducted oversight of PSP activities from August\n2002 until the Program ended in January 2007. It issued 12 formal reports\nand 14 Presidential Notifications on PSP activities at NSA.\n@ Investigations were conducted in response to specific incidents or\nviolations to determine the cause, effect, and remedy.\n0 Reviews were conducted to determine the adequacy of management\ncontrols to ensure compliance with the Authorization and related\nauthorities; to assess the efficiency and effectiveness in mitigating\nhigh-risk activities associated with the Program; and to identify\nimpediments to satisfying the requirements of the Authorization and\nrelated authorities.\n[¥] Presidential Notifications were drafted for the Director's signature\nto notify the President's Counsel about violations of the\nAuthorization. (See below for additional details.)\n@ Monthly Due Diligence Meetings were held by program officials\nto exercise \"due diligence\" in addressing program issues and\ndevelopments. The OIG attended these meetings to stay aware of\nprogram activities.\n(U//FOUO) OIG also provided oversight of FISC-authorized activity\npreviously conducted under Authorization.\n(U//FOUO) See Appendix H for a list of OIG reports on PSP activity at\nNSA.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n44\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n(U) NSA IG Not Cleared\n\nuntil\n\n2002\n\n(TS//SI//NF) We could not determine exact reasons for\nwhy the NSA IG was not cleared for the PSP until\nAugust 2002. According to the NSA General Counsel,\nthe President would not allow the IG to be briefed\nsooner. General Hayden did not specifically recall why\nthe IG was not brought in earlier, but thought that it\nhad not been appropriate to do so when it was\nuncertain how long the Program would last and before\noperations had stabilized. The NSA IG pointed out\nthat he did not take the IG position until April 2002, so\nNSA leadership or the White House may have been\nresistant to clearing either a new or an acting IG.\n(TS//SI//NF) Regardless, by August 2002, General\nHayden and the NSA General Counsel wanted to\ninstitutionalize oversight of the Program by bringing in\nthe IG. General Hayden recalled having to \"make a\ncase\" to the White House to clear the IG at that time.\n\n(U//FOUO) OIG concerns lead to change\n(C) In addition to formal recommendations made in review and\ninvestigative reports, OIG concerns about access to the terms of the\nPresidential authorization and about the means of reporting PSP violations\nresulted in three major changes.\n(C) First, in December 2002, the IG recommended that General Hayden\nformally delegate authority to NSA operational personnel, some of whom\nhad unknowingly violated terms of the Authorization. The Counsel to the\nVice President, demanding secrecy, refused to let them see terms of the\nauthority, which had been delegated by the President to the Secretary of\nDefense, who delegated it to the Director of NSA. General Hayden issued\nthe first \"Delegation of Authority\" letter to key operational personnel in the\nSID on 4 March 2003. Subsequent delegation letters were issued each time\nthe President renewed the authority.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR\n\n45\n\nCON/NOFORN\n\n\fTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\nWORKING DRAFT\n(C) Second, in March 2003, the IG advised General Hayden that he should\nreport violations of the Authorization to the President. In February of\n2003, the OIG learned of PSP incidents or violations that had not been\nreported to overseers as required, because none had the clearance to see the\nreport.\n(TS//SI//OC/NF) Before March 2003, N S A quarterly reports on\nintelligence activities sent to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board\n(through the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence\nOversight) stated that the Director was not aware of any unlawful\nsurveillance activities by N S A other than that described in the report.\nBeginning in March 2003, at the IG's direction, N S A quarterly reports\nstated that except as disclosed to the President, the Director was not aware\nof any unlawful surveillance activities by N S A . Also beginning in March\n2003, PSP violations, including those not previously reported to the\nIntelligence Oversight Board, were reported in \"Presidential Notifications.\"\n(U//FOUO) Third, shortly after learning about the Program, the IG\nparticipated in a September 2002 meeting of key cleared personnel at\nwhich important PSP matters were discussed. He recommended that these\ntypes of meetings be held every month. A s a result, monthly \"due\ndiligence\" meetings were held until the Program ended.\n\nTOP SECRET//S TL W//COMINT/OR CON/NOFORN\n\n46\n\n\fTOP\n\nSECRET//STLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nThis page intentionally left blank.\n\nTOP\n\nSECRET//STLW//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\n47\n\n\f\fTOP SECRET//STL W//COMINT/ORCON/NOFORN\n\nST-09-0002\n\nWORKING DRAFT\n\nWORKING DRAFT\nTOP SECRET//STL W//COMINT/OR CO N/NOFORN\n\n\f",

Wainstein ^\n^\nAssistant Attorney General\nNational Security Division\n\n' ..j\n\nCC:\n\nSteven G. Bradbury\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel\n\nSUBJECT:\n\nProposed Amendment to Department of Defense Procedures to Permit the\nNational Security Agency to Conduct Analysis of Communications\nMetadata Associated with Persons in the United States (S//SI)\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo Recommend Attorney General Approval Pursuant to Executive Order\n12333 of a Proposed Amsndment to Procedures Governing the National\nSecurity Agency's Signals Intelligence Activities (S//SI)\n\nO\n\nj:\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nThe Secretary of Defense seeks your approval of proposed Department of\nDefense Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis\n(\"Supplemental Procedures\"). The Supplemental Procedures, attached at Tab A, would clarify\nthat the National Security Agency (NSA) may analyze communications metadata associated with\nUnited States persons and persons believed to be in the United States. These Supplemental\nProcedures would amend the existing procedures promulgated pursuant to Executive Order\n\nSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN\nClassified by:\nReason:\nDeclassify on: 20 November. 2032\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\n12333.' That Order requires the NSA to conduct its signals intelligence activities involving the\ncollection, retention, or dissemination of information concerning United States persons in\naccordance with procedures approved by the Attorney General. Accordingly, changes to these\nprocedures, such as those proposed here, also require your approval. We conclude that the\nproposed Supplemental Procedures are consistent with applicable law and we recommend that\nyou approve them.2 (S//SI)\nThe communications metadata that the NSA wishes to analyze—which relates to both\ntelephone calls and electronic communications—is dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling\ninformation that does not concern the substance, purport, or meaning of the communication. The\nprocedures divide communications metadata into two categories: telephony metadata and\nelectronic communications metadata. Telephony metadata includes such information as the\ntelephone numbers of the calling and the called party. Electronic communications metadata\nincludes such information as the e-mail address and the Internet protocol (IP) address of the\ncomputer of the sender and the recipient. This communications metadata has been obtained by\nvarious methods, including pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 50\nU.S.C. § 1801, et seq., and resides in NSA databases.3 NSA plans to analyze this data primarily\nusing a technique known as \"contact chaining.\" Contact chaining involves the identification of\ntelephone numbers, e-mail addresses, or IP addresses that a targeted telephone number, IP\naddress, or e-mail address has contacted or attempted to contact. Through the use of computer\nalgorithms, NSA creates a chain of contacts linking communicants and identifying additional\ntelephone numbers, IP addresses, and e-mail addresses of intelligence interest. On the basis of\nprior informal advice of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, NSA's present practice is\nto \"stop\" when a chain hits a telephone number or address believed to be used by a United States\nperson. NSA believes that it is over-identifying numbers and addresses that belong to United\nStates persons and that modifying its practice to chain through all telephone numbers and\naddresses, including those reasonably believed to be used by a United States person, will yield\nvaluable foreign Intelligence information primarily concerning non-United States persons outside\n\n\nProcedures Governing the Activities of DOD Intelligence Components That Affect\nUnited States Persons (DOD Reg. 5240.1-R)(Dec. 1982)(approved by the Attorney General on\nOct. 4, 1982)(\"DOD Procedures\") and its Classified Annex. The proposed Supplemental\nProcedures would clarify Procedure 5 of the DOD Procedures and its Classified Annex. (U)\n\nThis memorandum was prepared in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel. (U)\n\n\nThis memorandum assumes that the NSA's initial acquisition of the information it\nwishes to analyze was lawful. (U)\n\nSEC RET//COM INT//O RCO N ,NO FO RN// X1\n\n- 2-\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\nthe United States. It is not clear, however, whether NSA's current procedures permit chaining\nthrough a United States telephone number, IP address or e-mail address. (S//SI)\nWe conclude that the proposed communications metadata analysis, including contact\nchaining, is consistent with (i) the Fourth Amendment; (ii) FISA; and (iii) the electronic\nsurveillance provisions contained in Title 18 of the United States Code. The Supplemental\nProcedures are also consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 12333. (S//SI)\nAs you consider this proposed change, you should be aware of the following:\n(1) Congressional Oversight. At the request of the Secretary of Defense, NSA briefed\nthe Select Committee on Intelligence of the United States Senate and the Permanent Select\nCommittee on Intelligence of the United States House of Representatives on this proposed\nchange before the Secretary signed the Supplemental Procedures.\n(2) Oversight of NSA's Activities Under the Supplemental Procedures. Because NSA\nhas in its databases a large amount of communications metadata associated with persons in the\nUnited States, misuse of this information could raise serious concerns. The General Counsel of\nNSA has provided a letter, attached at Tab B, describing how NSA will oversee access to and use\nof this data and committing to report annually to you on NSA's communications metadata\nprogram. As part of this reporting, NSA undertakes to inform the Department of \"the kinds of\ninformation that NSA is collecting and processing as communications metadata.\" Particularly as\ntechnology changes, this requirement is important because the legal standards governing\nmetadata are quite different from those governing the contents of a communication. We believe\nthat the oversight and reporting regime that this letter describes is a reasonable one, and it\ninforms our recommendation that you approve the Supplemental Procedures. (S//SI)\n(3) The Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Interest in Conducting Similar\nCommunications Metadata Analysis. On July 20, 2004, the General Counsel of CIA wrote to the\nGeneral Counsel of NSA and to the Counsel for Intelligence Policy asking that CIA receive from\nNSA United States communications metadata that NSA does not currently provide to CIA. The\nletter from CIA is attached at Tab C. Although the proposed Supplemental Procedures do not\ndirectly address the CIA's request, they do resolve a significant legal obstacle to the\ndissemination of this metadata from NSA to CIA. (S//SI//NF)\n(4) Department of Defense's (DOD) Interest in Allowing Other DOD Entities to Have\nAccess to this Data and to Conduct Similar Analysis. The DOD's General Counsel's Office has\ninformed us that, in the future, other DOD entities may wish to obtain and analyze\ncommunications metadata using the same rules that NSA uses to do so. The proposed\nSupplemental Procedures do not apply to these other DOD entities, but you should be aware that\n\nSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\n- 3-\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\nsuch a request may be forthcoming. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the National\nSecurity Division will be briefed by DOD concerning what these other DOD entities are doing,\nor are seeking to do, in this area before approving any such request. (S//SI)\n\nDISCUSSION: (U)\nThe Fourth Amendment (U)\nThe Fourth Amendment provides that:\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants\nshall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\nseized.\nU.S. Const, amend. IV. This provision protects against the unreasonable search and seizure of\nthe contents of a communication in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. See\nKatz v. U.S., 389 U.S. 347 (1967). We conclude that a person has no such expectation, however,\nin dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information that does not concern the substance,\npurport, or meaning of communications.4 We reach this conclusion with respect to \"metadata\"\n\n\nAs an initial matter, we note that the analysis of information legally within the\npossession of the Government is likely neither a \"search\" nor a \"seizure\" within the meaning of\nthe Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Jabara v. Webster\\ 691 F.2d 272, 277-79 (6th Cir 1982)\n(holding that the disclosure of information by an agency that lawfully possessed it to another\nagency does not implicate the Fourth Amendment); Memorandum for the Attorney General from\nTheodore B. Olson, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Constitutionality of\nCertain National Security Agency Electronic Surveillance Activities Not Covered Under the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of1978, at 59 (May 24 1984) (\"Olson Memorandum\")\n(\"Traditional Fourth Amendment analysis holds that once evidence is constitutionally seized, its\ndissemination or subsequent use raises no additional Fourth Amendment question.\"). As noted,\nwe assume for the purpose of this memorandum that the NSA has lawfully acquired the\ninformation it wishes to analyze. Nevertheless, die Olson Memorandum went on to consider the\nlimits on the subsequent use of information when assessing the constitutionality of NSA's\nsurveillance activities under the Fourth Amendment. See id. In an abundance of caution, then,\nwe analyze the constitutional issue on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment may apply\neven though the Government has already obtained the information lawfully. (S//SI)\n\nSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n_ 4_\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\nassociated with both telephone calls and electronic communications.5 (S//SI)\nThe Supreme Court has held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in\ntelephone numbers dialed because a caller must convey the numbers to the telephone company to\ncomplete the call. See Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979). In Smith, the Court\nconcluded that the installation of a pen register was not a \"search\" within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment, and thus that no warrant was required to collect such information. Id. at\n745-46. This conclusion followed from the Court's previous holding in U.S. v. Miller, 425 U.S.\n435 (1976), that an individual has no Fourth Amendment privacy interest in information released\nto a third party and later conveyed by that third party to a governmental entity. Id. at 440.\nAccordingly, it is well settled that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephony\nmetadata the NSA proposes to analyze.6 (S//SI)\nLikewise, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic communications\nmetadata. For Fourth Amendment purposes, courts have considered e-mails to be analogous to\ntelephone calls and to letters sent through the postal system. See U.S. v. Charbonneau, 979 F.\nSupp 1177, 1184 (S.D. Ohio 1997); U.S. v. Maxwell, 45 M.J. 406, 417 (C.A.A.F. 1996).\nFollowing the same approach as Smith, courts have consistently held that the Fourth Amendment\nis not implicated when the Government gathers information that appears on mail covers,\nincluding the name and address of the addressee and of the sender, the postmark, and the class of\nmail. See U.S. v. Choate, 576 F.2d 165, 174 (9th Cir. 1978); U.S. v. DePoli, 628 F:2d 779 (2nd\nCir. 1980); U.S. v. Huie, 593 F.2d 14 (5th Cir. 1979)(per curiam). See also Vreeken v. Davis,\n718 F.2d 343, 347-48 (10th Cir. 1983) (concluding that a mail cover, which records information\nabout the sender and recipient of a letter, is \"indistinguishable in any important respect from the\npen register at issue in Smith\"). And courts have consistently found that individuals do not have\na reasonable expectation of privacy in information pertaining to the use of electronic media that\n\n\nIt is important to note that this memorandum addresses only those types of metadata\nspecifically identified in the Supplemental Procedures. As described above, NSA is required to\nreport regularly to the Department on new types of information that it is treating as \"metadata.\"\nIf NSA does so, we will evaluate whether such new information also falls outside the Fourth\nAmendment. (S//SI)\n\nSmith continues to be cited by the Supreme Court and lower courts for the proposition\nthat acquisition of telephone numbers does not implicate the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Kyllo\nv. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001); U.S. Telecom Commission v. FCC, 227 F.3d450,454\n(D.C. Cir. 2000). (U)\nSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n_ 5_\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\ndoes not reveal the substantive content of a communication.7 The electronic communications\nmetadata the NSA proposes to analyze—dialing, routing, addressing or signaling information—is\nidentical in all material respects to the information deemed not to implicate the Fourth\nAmendment in these lines of cases. (S//SI)\nThus, when interpreting the Fourth Amendment, the courts have drawn a consistent\ndistinction between the substantive content of the communications (found to be protected in\nKatz) and the non-content information (found to be unprotected in Smith, Miller and a number of\nlower court cases). The communications metadata implicated by the proposed Supplemental\nProcedures is limited to dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information and is defined\nspecifically to exclude any information that concerns the substance, purport or meaning of the\ncommunication. Thus it falls clearly within the second, unprotected category of information.\nWe conclude, therefore, that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in this metadata and\nthat the communications metadata analysis proposed by NSA does not implicate the Fourth\nAmendment. (S//SI)\nFISA's Electronic Surveillance Provisions (U)\nTo fall within FISA's coverage of \"electronic surveillance,\" an action must satisfy one of\nthe four definitions of that term. None of these definitions cover the communications metadata\nanalysis at issue here.8 (S)\n\n\nSee Thygeson v. U.S. Bancorp, WL 2066746 (D. Or. 2004) (noting the distinction\nbetween the website addresses at issue there, in which an employee had no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, and the contents of websites visited or e-mails sent). See also U.S. v.\nHambrick, 225 F.3d 656 (4th Cir. 2000) (unpublished opinion) (holding that, although in certain\ncircumstances a person may have a privacy interest in \"content information\" such as the\nsubstance of an e-mail, there is no privacy interest in information provided to the ISP for\npurposes of establishing the account, which, according to the court, is non-content information);\nU.S. v. Ohnesorge, 60 M J . 946 (N.M. Ct. Crim. App. 2005) (holding that there is no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy regarding information provided to an ISP). (S//SI)\n\nAs noted above, some of the metadata the NSA would analyze has been acquired\npursuant to FISA and thus is subject to the minimization procedures applicable to that collection.\nThe standard NSA FISA minimization procedures contain no restrictions that would prohibit the\nmetadata analysis described herein. The NSA will continue to comply with these procedures,\nincluding with any restrictions on the dissemination of information. In addition, to the extent\nthat any orders authorizing, under FISA, the collection of metadata impose minimization\nprocedures that would restrict the metadata analysis in the manner proposed here by NSA, the\nNSA must continue to abide by the conditions in those orders. (S//SI)\nSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\n- 6 -\n\n\fS EC RET//COMINT//0 RCON,N O FO RN//X1\n\nThree of the four definitions of electronic surveillance are satisfied only when the\ncommunication is acquired \"under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation\nof privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.\" 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1801(f)(1), (3), (4). This statutory expectation-of-privacy requirement adopts a term of art\nfrom Fourth Amendment case law. See, e.g., Katz, 389 U.S. at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring).\n\"[W]here Congress borrows terms of a r t . . . it presumably knows and adopts . . . the meaning\n[their] use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.\" Morissette v. United\nStates, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952). The legislative history confirms the applicability of this\npresumption in this instance. It repeatedly adverts to constitutional standards when discussing\nthis provision. See, e.g., S. Rep. 95-701, at 37, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4006 (noting that the\nprovision \"require[s] that the acquisition of information be under circumstances in which a\nperson has a constitutionally protected right of privacy\"); H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, at 53 (same);\nS. Rep. No. 95-604, at 35, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3937 (same). For the reasons stated above,\nthere is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the communications metadata at issue here;\ntherefore, NSA's proposed activity would not come within the definitions of electronic\nsurveillance contained in subsections 1801(f)(1), (3) or (4). (S)\nThe fourth definition of electronic surveillance involves \"the acquisition by an electronic,\nmechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication . . . . \" 50\nU.S.C. § 1802(f)(2). \"Wire communication\" is, in turn, defined as \"any communication while it\nis being carried by a wire, cable, or other like connection furnished or operated by any person\nengaged as a common e a r n e r . . . . \" Id. § 1801(1). The data that the NSA wishes to analyze\nalready resides in its databases. The proposed analysis thus does not involve the acquisition of a\ncommunication \"while it is being carried\" by a connection furnished or operated by a common\ncarrier. (S//SI)\nPen Register and Trap and Trace Provisions (U)\nThe pen register and trap and trace surveillance provisions of FISA, 50 U.S.C. §§ 18411846, and of the criminal law, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27, do not apply to the communications\nmetadata analysis that NSA wishes to conduct. (S//SI)\nFirst, for the purpose of these provisions, \"pen register\" is defined as \"a device or process\nwhich records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing or signaling information.\" 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3127(3); 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2). When NSA will conduct the analysis it proposes, however, the\ndialing and other information will have been already recorded and decoded. Second, a \"trap and\ntrace device\" is defined as \"a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other\nimpulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing and\nsignaling information.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3127(4); 50 U.S.C. § 1841(2). Again, those impulses will\nalready have been captured at the point that NSA conducts chaining. Thus, NSA's\ncommunications metadata analysis falls outside the coverage of these provisions. (S//SI)\n\nSECRET//COMINT//QRCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\n\fS EC RET//CO M I N T//O RCO N ,N O FO RN//X1\n\nTitle III (U)\nThe federal criminal wiretap statute, Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe\nStreets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2510, et seq., prohibits the unauthorized \"interception]\" of any wire,\noral or electronic communication, id. at § 2511(1), which is defined as the acquisition of the\n\"contents\" of the communication, id. at § 2510(4). It also prohibits the use and disclosure of the\n\"contents\" of such a communication if it was unlawfully intercepted. See id. at § 2511(1). For\nthe purpose of these prohibitions, \"contents\" is defined as \"information concerning the substance,\npurport, or meaning of that communication.\" Id. § 2510(8); see United States v. New York\nTelephone Co., 434 U.S. 159 (1977) (holding that Title III does not cover the acquisition of\nmetadata with pen registers). By its terms, the Supplemental Procedures' definition of the\ncommunications metadata to be analyzed excludes information about the substance, purport, or\nmeaning of the communication. For this reason at least, the prohibitions of section 2511 (1 ) do\nnot apply to the proposed communications metadata analysis. (S//SI)\nExecutive Order 12333 and Related Procedures (U)\nExecutive Order 12333 requires the NSA to conduct its signals intelligence activities\ninvolving the collection, retention, or dissemination of information concerning United States\npersons in accordance with procedures approved by the Attorney General. See id. § 2.3; § 2.4.9\nThese procedures must permit the collection, retention, and dissemination of certain types of\ninformation including foreign intelligence information in a manner that protects constitutional\nand other legal rights and limits the use of the information to lawful government purposes. See\nid. § 2.4. The Attorney General approved the current Department of Defense procedures and\nClassified Annex in October 1982. (U)\nThe current DOD procedures and their Classified Annex may be read to restrict NSA's\nability to conduct the desired communications metadata analysis, at least with respect to metadata\nassociated with United States persons. In particular, this analysis may fall within the procedures'\ndefinitions of, and thus restrictions on, the \"interception\" and \"selection\" of communications.\n\n\nhi addition, section 2.5 of Executive Order 12333 provides that the \"Attorney General\nhereby is delegated the power to approve the use for intelligence purposes, within the United\nStates or against a United States person abroad, of any technique for which a warrant would be\nrequired if undertaken for law enforcement purposes.\" Because individuals have no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the types of metadata at issue here, no warrant would be required to\nanalyze this information for law enforcement purposes. In addition, the analysis of information\nlegally within the possession of the government is likely neither a \"search\" nor a \"seizure\" within\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment. See note 4, supra. Section 2.5 thus does not require the\nAttorney General to approve NSA's proposed analysis of communications metadata. (S)\n\nSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n- 8-\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//ORCON,NOFORN//Xl\n\nAccordingly, the Supplemental Procedures that would govern NSA's analysis of communications\nmetadata expressly state that the DOD Procedures and the Classified Annex do not apply to the\nanalysis of communications metadata. Specifically, the Supplemental Procedures would clarify\nthat \"contact chaining and other metadata analysis do not qualify as the 'interception' or\n'selection' of communications, nor do they qualify as 'usfing] a selection term,' including using a\nselection term 'intended to intercept a communication on the basis o f . . . [some] aspect of the\ncontent of the communication.\" Once approved, the Supplemental Procedures will clarify that\nthe communications metadata analysis the NSA wishes to conduct is not restricted by the DOD\nprocedures and their Classified Annex. (S//SI)\nThe Supplemental Procedures define the terms \"communications metadata,\" \"contact\nchaining,\" and \"metadata analysis.\" The Supplemental Procedures also state that NSA will\nconduct contact chaining and other metadata analysis only for valid foreign intelligence\npurposes; disseminate the results of its analysis in accordance with current procedures governing\ndissemination of information concerning U.S. persons as set forth in Section 4.A.4 of the\nClassified Annex; and investigate any apparent misuse or improper dissemination of metadata\nand report the same to the appropriate oversight organization(s). (S//SI)\nIn addition, the NSA letter accompanying the Supplemental Procedures proposes a\nregulatory and oversight regime for the handling of communications metadata of U.S. persons.\nNSA states that access to communications metadata will be restricted to only those personnel\nwith a need for this data in the performance of their official duties. Before gaining access to\ncommunications metadata, NSA or other personnel working under the authority of the Director\nof NSA will receive mandatory training approved by the General Counsel of NSA on the proper\nuse of such databases and chaining tools. When logging into the electronic data system, users\nwill view a banner that re-emphasizes key points regarding use of the data, chaining tools, and\nproper dissemination of results. NSA will also create an audit trail of every query made in each\ndatabase containing U.S. communications metadata, and a network of auditors will spot-check\nactivities in the database to ensure compliance with all procedures. In addition, the NSA\nOversight and Compliance Office will conduct periodic super audits to verify that activities\nremain properly controlled. Finally, NSA will report any misuse of the information to the NSA's\nInspector General and Office of General Counsel for inclusion in existing or future reporting\nmechanisms related to NSA's signals intelligence activities. (S//SI//OC,NF)\nNSA also states it will report any changes to this oversight regime to the Assistant\nAttorney Genera] for the National Security Division, and, by October 15 of each year, will submit\na report to the Attorney General regarding the kinds of information the NSA is collecting and\nprocessing as communications metadata, NSA's implementation of its compliance procedures,\nand any significant new legal or oversight issues that have arisen in connection with NSA's\nactivities described in this memorandum.

Together with the current approved procedures, they continue to permit the collection of\nforeign intelligence and other information and, as explained above, the metadata analysis will be\nfor lawful government purposes and consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law.\n\n(S)\nRECOMMENDATION:\nBased on the information provided by NSA and our analysis of\napplicable law, we conclude that there are no constitutional or statutory restrictions on NSA's\nproposed use of communications metadata. We therefore recommend that you approve the\nSupplemental Procedures.

These procedures govern NSA's\nanalysis of data that it has already lawfully collected and do not authorize\ncollection of additional data. These procedures also clarify that, except as stated\nin section 3 below, the Procedures in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and the Classified\nAnnex thereto do not apply to the analysis of communications metadata.\nSec. 2: Definitions\n(S//SI) Communications metadata means the dialing, routing, addressing, or\nsignaling information associated with a communication, but does not\ninclude information concerning the substance, purport or meaning of the\ncommunication. The two principal subsets of communications metadata are\ntelephony metadata and electronic communications metadata.\n(a) Telephony \"metadata\" includes the telephone number of the calling\nparty, the telephone number of the called party, and the date, time, and\nduration of the call. It does not include the substance, purport, or\nmeaning of the communication.\n(b) For electronic communications, \"metadata\" includes the information\nappearing on the \"to,\" \"from,\" \"cc,\" and \"bee\" lines of a standard\ne-mail or other electronic communication. For e-mail communications,\nthe \"from\" line contains the e-mail address of the sender, and the \"to,\"\n\"cc,\" and \"bcc\" lines contain the e-mail addresses of the recipients.\n\"Metadata\" also means (1) information about the Internet-protocol (IP)\naddress of the computer from which an e-mail or other electronic\ncommunication was sent and, depending on the circumstances, the IP\naddress of routers and servers on the Internet that have handled the\ncommunication during transmission; (2) the exchange of an IP address and\ne-mail address that occurs when a user logs into a web-based e-mail\nservice; and (3) for certain logins to web-based e-mail accounts, inbox\nmetadata that is transmitted to die user upon accessing the account.\n\"Metadata\" associated with electronic communications does not include\ninformation from the \"subject\" or \"re\" line of an e-mail or information\nfrom the body of an e-mail.\n\n\f(S//S1) Contact chaining. Contact chaining is a process by which\ncommunications metadata is organized. It shows, for example, the telephone\nnumbers or e-mail addresses that a particular telephone number or e-mail address\nhas been in contact with, or has attempted to contact. Through this process,\ncomputer algorithms automatically identify not only the first tier of contacts made\nby the seed telephone number or e-mail address, but also the further contacts made\nby the first tier of telephone numbers or e-mail addresses and so on.\nSec. 3: Procedures\n(a) (S//SI) NSA will conduct contact chaining and other communications\nmetadata analysis only for valid foreign intelligence purposes.\n(b) (S//SI) NSA will disseminate the results of its contact chaining and other\nanalysis of communications metadata in accordance with current procedures\ngoverning dissemination of information concerning US persons. See Section\n4.A.4 of the Classified Annex to Procedure 5 of DoD Regulation 5240.1-R.\n(c) (U//FGUO) Any apparent misuse or improper dissemination of metadata\nshall be investigated and reported to appropriate oversight organization(s). See\nProcedure 15 of DoD Regulation 5240.1 -R.\nSec. 4: Clarification\n(S//SI) For purposes of Procedure 5 of DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and the\nClassified Annex thereto, contact chaining and other metadata analysis do n.<t\nqualify as the \"interception\" or \"selection\" of communications, nor do they qualify\nas \"usfing] a selection term,\" including using a selection term \"intended to\nintercept a communication on the basis o f . . .

(U)\nIf NSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these minimization\nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force protection or\nhostage situations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these\nprocedures, NSA may take such action immediately. NSA will report the action taken to the\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence and to the National Security Division of the\nDepartment of Justice, which will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt of such activity. (U)\nSection 2 - Definitions (U)\nIn addition to the definitions in sections 101 and 701 of the Act, the following definitions\nwill apply to these procedures:\n(a) Acquisition means the collection by NSA or the FBI through electronic means of a nonpublic communication to which it is not an intended party. (U)\n(b) Communications concerning a United States person include all communications in which\na United States person is discussed or mentioned, except where such communications\nreveal only publicly-available information about the person. (U)\n(c) Communications of a United States person include all communications to which a United\nStates person is a party. (U)\n(d) Consent is the agreement by a person or organization to permit the NSA to take particular\nactions that affect the person or organization. To be effective, consent must be given by\nthe affected person or organization with sufficient knowledge to understand the action\nthat may be taken and the possible consequences of that action. Consent by an\norganization will be deemed valid if given on behalf of the organization by an official or\ngoverning body determined by the General Counsel, NSA, to have actual or apparent\nauthority to make such an agreement.

All other communications, including communications in\nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are reasonably believed to be located in the\nUnited States at the time of acquisition, are domestic communications. (S//SI)\n(f) Identification of a United States person means the name, unique title, address, or other\npersonal identifier of a United States person in the context of activities conducted by that\nperson or activities conducted by others that are related to that person. A reference to a\nproduct by brand name, or manufacturer's name or the use of a name in a descriptive\nsense, e.g., \"Monroe Doctrine,\" is not an identification of a United States person. (S//SI)\n(g) Processed or processing means any step necessary to convert a communication into an\nintelligible form intended for human inspection. (U)\n(h) Publicly-available information means information that a member of the public could\nobtain on request, by research in public sources, or by casual observation. (U)\n(i) Technical data base means information retained for cryptanalytic, traffic analytic, oxsignal exploitation purposes. (S//S1)\n(j) United States person means a United States person as defined in the Act. The following\nguidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is unknown is a United\nStates person: (U)\n(1) A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United States\nperson unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for\npermanent residence, or unless the nature or circumstances of the person's\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a United\nStates person. (U)\n(2) A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is\nunknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be\npositively identified as such, or the nature or circumstances of the person's\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States\nperson. (U)\n(3) A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence loses status as a\nUnited States person if the person leaves the United States and is not in compliance\nwith 8 U.S.C. § 1203 enabling re-entry into the United States. Failure to follow the\nstatutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that the alien has\nabandoned any intention of maintaining his status as a permanent resident alien. (U)\n(4) An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located\noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is\ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the\nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

(S//SI)\n(b) Monitoring, Recording, and Processing (U)\n(1) Personnel will exercise reasonable judgment in determining whether information\nacquired must be minimized and will destroy inadvertently acquired communications\nof or concerning a United States person at the earliest practicable point in the\nprocessing cycle at which such communication can be identified either: as clearly not\nrelevant to the authorized puipose of the acquisition (e.g., the communication does\nnot contain foreign intelligence information); or, as not containing evidence of a\ncrime which may be disseminated under these procedures. Such inadvertently\nacquired communications of or concerning a United States person may be retained no\nlonger than five years in any event. The communications that may be retained\ninclude electronic communications acquired because of limitations onNSA's ability\nto filter communications. (S//SI)\n(2) Communications of or concerning United States persons that may be related to the\nauthorized puipose of the acquisition may be forwarded to analytic personnel\nresponsible for producing intelligence information from the collected data. Such\ncommunications or information may be retained and disseminated only in accordance\nwith Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of these procedures. (C)\n(3) Magnetic tapes or other storage media that contain acquired communications may be\nprocessed. (S)\n(4) As a communication is reviewed, NSA analyst(s) will determine whether it is a\ndomestic or foreign communication to, from, or about a target and is reasonably\nbelieved to contain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime. Only\nsuch communications may be processed. All other communications may be retained\nor disseminated only in accordance with Sections 5, 6, and 8 of these procedures.\n(S//SI)\n(5) Magnetic tapes or other storage media containing communications acquired pursuant\nto section 702 may be scanned by computer to identify and select communications for\nanalysis. Computer selection terms used for scanning, such as telephone numbers,\nkey words or phrases, or other discriminators, will not include United States person\nSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310108\nnames or identifiers and will be limited to those selection terms reasonably likely to\nreturn information about foreign intelligence targets. (S//S1)\n(6) Further processing, retention and dissemination of foreign communications will be\nmade in accordance with Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8 as applicable, below. Further\nprocessing, storage and dissemination of inadvertently acquired domestic\ncommunications will be made in accordance with Sections 4, 5, and 8 below. (S//SI)\n(c) Destruction of Raw Data (C)\nCommunications and other information, including that reduced to graphic or \"hard copy\"\nform such as facsimile, telex, computer data, or equipment emanations, will be reviewed for\nretention in accordance with the standards set forth in these procedures. Communications\nand other information, in any form, that do not meet such retention standards and that are\nknown to contain communications of or concerning United States persons will be destroyed\nupon recognition, and may be retained no longer than five years in any event. The\ncommunications that may be retained include electronic communications acquired because of\nlimitations on NSA's ability to filter communications. (S//SI)\n(d) Change in Target's Location or Status (S//SI)\n(1) In the event that NSA determines that a person is reasonably believed to be located\noutside the United States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside\nthe United States, or if NSA concludes that a person who at the time of targeting was\nbelieved to be a non-United States person is in fact a United States person, the\nacquisition from that person will be terminated without delay. (S//SI)\n(2) Any communications acquired through the targeting of a person who at the time of\ntargeting was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States but is in fact\nlocated inside the United States at the time such communications were acquired, and\nany communications acquired by targeting a person who at the time of targeting was\nbelieved to be a non-United States person but was in fact a United States person, will\nbe treated as domestic communications under these procedures. (S//SI)\nSection 4 - Acquisition and Processing - Attorney-Client Communications (C)\nAs soon as it becomes apparent that a communication is between a person who is known to\nbe under criminal indictment in the United States and an attorney who represents that\nindividual in the matter under indictment (or someone acting on behalf of the attorney),\nmonitoring of that communication will cease and the communication will be identified as an\nattorney-client communication in a log maintained for that purpose. The relevant portion of\nthe communication containing that conversation will be segregated and the National Security\nDivision of the Department of Justice will be notified so that appropriate procedures may be\nestablished to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal prosecution,\nwhile preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein. Additionally, all\nproposed disseminations of information constituting United States person attorney-client\nSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310108\nprivileged communications must be reviewed by the NSA Office of General Counsel prior to\ndissemination. (S//SI)\nSection 5 - Domestic Communications (U)\nA communication identified as a domestic communication will be promptly destroyed upon\nrecognition unless the Director (or Acting Director) of NSA specifically determines, in\nwriting, that: (S)\n(1) the communication is reasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence\ninformation. Such communication may be provided to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) (including United States person identities) for possible\ndissemination by the FBI in accordance with its minimization procedures; (S)\n(2) the communication does not contain foreign intelligence information but is\nreasonably believed to contain evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about\nto be committed. Such communication may be disseminated (including United States\nperson identities) to appropriate Federal law enforcement authorities, in accordance\nwith 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(b) and 1825(c), Executive Order No. 12333, and, where\napplicable, the crimes reporting procedures set out in the August 1995 \"Memorandum\nof Understanding: Reporting of Information Concerning Federal Crimes,\" or any\nsuccessor document. Such communications may be retained by NSA for a reasonable\nperiod of time, not to exceed six months unless extended in writing by the Attorney\nGeneral, to permit law enforcement agencies to determine whether access to original\nrecordings of such communications is required for law enforcement purposes; (S)\n(3) the communication is reasonably believed to contain technical data base information,\nas defined in Section 2(i), or information necessary to understand or assess a\ncommunications security vulnerability. Such communication may be provided to the\nFBI and/or disseminated, to other elements of the United States Government. Such\ncommunications may be retained for a period sufficient to allow a thorough\nexploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to\nbecome, relevant to a current or future foreign intelligence requirement. Sufficient\nduration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. (S//SI)\na. In the context of a cryptanalytic effort, maintenance of technical data bases\nrequires retention of all communications that are enciphered or reasonably\nbelieved to contain secret meaning, and sufficient duration may consist of any\nperiod of time during which encrypted material is subject to, or of use in,\ncryptanalysis. (S//SI)\nb. In the case of communications that are not enciphered or otherwise thought to\ncontain secret meaning, sufficient duration is five years unless the Signal\nIntelligence Director, NSA, determines in writing that retention for a longer\nperiod is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or\ncounterintelligence requirements; or (S//SI)\nSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310108\n(4) the communication contains information pertaining to a threat of serious harm to life\nor property. (S)\nNotwithstanding the above, if a domestic communication indicates that a target has entered\nthe United States, NSA may advise the FBI of that fact. Moreover, technical data regarding\ndomestic communications may be retained and provided to the FBI and CIA for collection\navoidance purposes. (S//SI)\nSection 6 - Foreign Communications of or Concerning United States Persons (U)\n(a) Retention (U)\nForeign communications of or concerning United States persons collected in the course of an\nacquisition authorized under section 702 of the Act may be retained only:\n(1) if necessary for the maintenance of technical data bases.

(S//SI)\n(b) Dissemination (U)\nA report based on communications of or concerning a United States person may be\ndisseminated in accordance with Section 7 or 8 if the identity of the United States person is\ndeleted and a generic term or symbol is substituted so that the information cannot reasonably\nbe connected with an identifiable United States person. Otherwise, dissemination of\nintelligence reports based on communications of or concerning a United States person may\nSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310108\nonly be made to a recipient requiring the identity of such person for the performance of\nofficial duties but only if at least one of the following criteria is also met:\n(1) the United States person has consented to dissemination or the information of or\nconcerning the United States person is available publicly;\n(2) the identity of the United States person is necessary to understand foreign intelligence\ninformation or assess its importance, e.g., the identity of a senior official in the\nExecutive Branch;\n(3) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be:\na. an agent of a foreign power:\nb. a foreign power as defined in Section 101(a) of the Act;\nc. residing outside the United States and holding an official position in the\ngovernment or military forces of a foreign power;\nd. a corporation or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a\nforeign power; or\ne. acting in collaboration with an intelligence or security service of a foreign power\nand the United States person has, or has had, access to classified national security\ninformation or material;\n(4) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be the\ntarget of intelligence activities of a foreign power;\n(5) the communication or information indicates that the United States person is engaged\nin the unauthorized disclosure of classified national security information or the\nUnited States person's identity is necessary to understand or assess a communications\nsecurity vulnerability, but only after the agency that originated the information\ncertifies that it is properly classified;\n(6) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be\nengaging in international terrorist activities;\n(7) the acquisition of the United States person's communication was authorized by a\ncourt order issued pursuant to the Act and the communication may relate to the\nforeign intelligence purpose of the surveillance; or\n(8) the communication or information is reasonably believed to contain evidence that a\ncrime has been, is being, or is about to be committed, provided that dissemination is\nfor law enforcement purposes and is made in accordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(b)\nand 1825(c), Executive Order No. 12333, and, where applicable, the crimes reporting\nSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310108\nprocedures set out in the August 1995 \"Memorandum of Understanding: Reporting of\nInformation Concerning Federal Crimes,\" or any successor document. (U)\n(c) Provision of Unminimized Communications to CIA and FBI (S//NF)\n(1) NSA may provide to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) unminimized\ncommunications acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act. CIA will\nidentify to NS A targets for which NSA may provide unminimized\ncommunications to CIA. CIA will process any such unminimized\ncommunications received from NSA in accordance with CIA minimization\nprocedures adopted by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director\nof National Intelligence, pursuant to subsection 702(e) of the Act. (S//SI//NF)\n(2) NSA may provide to the FBI unminimized communications acquired pursuant to\nsection 702 of the Act. The FBI will identify to NSA targets for which NSA may\nprovide unminimized communications to the FBI. The FBI will process any such\nunminimized communications received from NSA in accordance with FBI\nminimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General, in consultation with the\nDirector of National Intelligence, pursuant to subsection 702(e) of the Act. (S//SI)\nSection 7 - Other Foreign Communications (U)\nForeign communications of or concerning a non-United States person may be retained, used,\nand disseminated in any form in accordance with other applicable law, regulation, and policy.\n(U)\nSection 8 - Collaboration with Foreign Governments (S//SI)\n(a) Procedures for the dissemination of evaluated and minimized information. Pursuant to\nSection 1.7(c)(8) of Executive Order No. 12333, as amended, NSA conducts foreign\ncryptologie liaison relationships with certain foreign governments. Information acquired\npursuant to section 702 of the Act may be disseminated to a foreign government. Except\nas provided in subsection 8(b) of these procedures, any dissemination to a foreign\ngovernment of information of or concerning a United States person that is acquired\npursuant to section 702 may only be done in a manner consistent with subsections 6(b)\nand 7 of these NSA minimization procedures. (S)\n(b) Procedures for technical or linguistic assistance. It is anticipated that NSA may obtain\ninformation or communications that, because of their technical or linguistic content, may\nrequire further analysis by foreign governments to assist NSA in determining their\nmeaning or significance. Notwithstanding other provisions of these minimization\nprocedures, NSA may disseminate computer disks, tape recordings, transcripts, or other\ninformation or items containing unminimized information or communications acquired\npursuant to section 702 to foreign governments for further processing and analysis, under\nthe following restrictions with respect to any materials so disseminated: (S)\nSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fSECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310108\n(1) Dissemination to foreign governments will be solely for translation or analysis\nof such information or communications, and assisting foreign governments\nwill make no use of any information or any communication of or concerning\nany person except to provide technical and linguistic assistance to NSA. (S)\n(2) Dissemination will be only to those personnel within foreign governments\ninvolved in the translation or analysis of such information or communications.\nThe number of such personnel will be restricted to the extent feasible. There\nwill be no dissemination within foreign governments of this unminimized data.\n(S)\n(3) Foreign governments will make no permanent agency record of information or\ncommunications of or concerning any person referred to or recorded on\ncomputer disks, tape recordings, transcripts, or other items disseminated by\nNSA to foreign governments, provided that foreign governments may\nmaintain such temporary records as are necessary to enable them to assist\nNSA with the translation or analysis of such information. Records maintained\nby foreign governments for this purpose may not be disseminated within the\nforeign governments, except to personnel involved in providing technical or\nlinguistic assistance to NSA. (S)\n(4) Upon the conclusion of such technical or linguistic assistance to NSA,\ncomputer disks, tape recordings, transcripts, or other items or information\ndisseminated to foreign governments will either be returned to NSA or be\ndestroyed with an accounting of such destruction made to NSA. (S)\n(5) Any information that foreign governments provide to NSA as a result of such\ntechnical or linguistic assistance may be disseminated by NSA in accordance\nwith these minimization procedures.

(U) DETERMINATION OF W H E T H E R THE ACQUISITION TARGETS NONUNITED STATES PERSONS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE\nTHE UNITED STATES\n(S) NSA determines whether a person is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be\noutside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the information\navailable with respect to that person, including information concerning the communications\nfacility or facilities used by that person.\n(S) NSA analysts examine the following three categories of information, as appropriate under the\ncircumstances, to make the above determination: (1) they examine the lead information they\nhave received regarding the potential target or the facility that has generated interest in\nconducting surveillance to determine what that lead information discloses about the person's\nlocation; (2) they conduct research in NSA databases, available reports and collateral\ninformation (i.e., information to which NSA has access but did not originate, such as reports\nfrom other agencies and publicly available information) to determine whether NSA knows the\nlocation of the person, or knows information that would provide evidence concerning that\nlocation; and (3) they conduct technical analyses of the facility or facilities to determine or verify\ninformation about the person's location. NSA may use information from any one or a\ncombination of these categories of information in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to\ndetermine that the potential target is located outside the United States.\n(TS//SI) In addition, in those cases where NSA seeks to acquire communications about the\ntarget that are not to or from the target, NSA will either employ an Internet Protocol filter to\nensure that the person from whom it seeks to obtain foreign intelligence information is located\nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52\nDated: 20070108\nDeclassify On: 20320108\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFQRN//2Q320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFGRN//20320108\noverseas, or it will target Internet links that terminate in a foreign country. In either event, NSA\nwill direct surveillance at a party to the communication reasonably believed to be outside the\nUnited States.\n(S) Lead Information\n(S) When NSA proposes to direct surveillance at a target, it does so because NSA has already\nlearned something about the target or the facility or facilities the target uses to communicate.\nAccordingly, NSA will examine the lead information to determine what it reveals about the\nphysical location of the target, including the location of the facility or facilities being used by the\npotential target.\n(S) The following are examples of the types of lead information that NSA may examine:\na) Has the target stated that he is located outside the United States? For example, has\nNSA or another intelligence agency collected a statement or statements made by the\ntarget indicating that he is located outside the United States?\nb) Has a human intelligence source or other source of lead information indicated that the\ntarget is located outside the United States?\nc) Does the lead information provided by an intelligence or law enforcement agency of\nthe United States government or an intelligence or law enforcement service of a\nforeign government indicate that the target is located outside the United States?\nd) Was the lead information about the target found on a hard drive or other medium that\nwas seized in a foreign country?\ne) With whom has the target had direct contact, and what do we know about the location\nof such persons? For example, if lead information indicates the target is in direct\ncontact with several members of a foreign-based terrorist organization or foreignbased political organization who themselves are located overseas, that may suggest,\ndepending on the totality of the circumstances, that the target is also located overseas.\n(S) Information NSA Has About the Target's Location and/or Facility or Facilities Used by\nthe Target\n(S) NSA may also review information in its databases, including repositories of information\ncollected by NSA and by other intelligence agencies, as well as publicly available information, to\ndetermine if the person's location, or information providing evidence about the person's location,\nis already known. The NSA databases that would be used for this purpose contain information\nculled from signals intelligence, human intelligence, law enforcement information, and other\nsources. For example, NSA databases may include a report produced by the Central Intelligence\nAgency (CIA) with the fact that a known terrorist is using a telephone with a particular number,\nor detailed information on worldwide telephony numbering plans for wire and wireless telephone\nsystems.\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//203201Q8\n(S) NSA Technical Analysis of the Facility\n(S) NSA may also apply technical analysis concerning the facility from which it intends to\nacquire foreign intelligence information to assist it in making determinations concerning the\nlocation of the person at whom NSA intends to direct surveillance. For example, NSA may\nexamine the following types of information:\n(S) For telephone numbers:\na) Identify the country code of the telephone number, and determine what it indicates\nabout the person's location.\nb) Review commercially available and NSA telephone numbering databases for\nindications of the type of telephone being used (e.g. landline, wireless mobile,\nsatellite, etc.), information that may provide an understanding of the location of the\ntarget.\n(S) For electronic communications accounts/addresses/identifiers:\nReview NSA content repositories and Internet communications data repositories (which\ncontain, among other things, Internet communications metadata) for previous Internet\nactivity. This information may contain network layer (e.g., Internet Protocol addresses)\nor machine identifier (e.g., Media Access Control addresses) information, which NSA\ncompares to information contained in NSA's communication network databases and\ncommercially available Internet Protocol address registration information in order to\ndetermine the location of the target.\n(S) Assessment of the Non-United States Person Status of the Target\n(S) In many cases, the information that NSA examines in order to determine whether a target is\nreasonably believed to be located outside the United States may also bear upon the non-United\nStates person status of that target. For example, lead information provided by an intelligence or\nlaw enforcement service of a foreign government may indicate not only that the target is located\nin a foreign country, but that the target is a citizen of that or another foreign country. Similarly,\ninformation contained in NSA databases, including repositories of information collected by NSA\nand by other intelligence agencies, may indicate that the target is a non-United States person.\n(S) Furthermore, in order to prevent the inadvertent targeting of a United States person, NSA\nmaintains records of telephone numbers and electronic communications accounts/addresses/\nidentifiers that NSA has reason to believe are being used by United States persons. Prior to\ntargeting, a particular telephone number or electronic communications account/address/identifier\nwill be compared against those records in order to ascertain whether NSA has reason to believe\nthat telephone number or electronic communications account/address/identifier is being used by\na United States person.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n(S) 111 the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person, a\nperson reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is not\nknown will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be positively\nidentified as a United States person, or the nature or circumstances of the person's\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States person.\n(S) Assessment of the Foreign Intelligence Purpose of the Targeting\n(S) In assessing whether the target possesses and/or is likely to communicate foreign\nintelligence information concerning a foreign power or foreign territory, NSA considers, among\nother tilings, the following factors:\na. With respect to telephone communications:\nInformation indicates that the telephone number has been used to communicate\ndirectly with another telephone number reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence\nCommunity to be used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory;\nInformation indicates that a user of the telephone number has communicated directly\nwith an individual reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence Community to be\nassociated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\n•\n\nInformation indicates that the telephone number is listed in the telephone directory of\na telephone used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\nInformation indicates that the telephone number has been transmitted during a\ntelephone call or other communication with an individual reasonably believed by the\nU.S. Intelligence Community to be associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory;\n\n•\n\nPublicly available sources of information (e.g., telephone listings) match the\ntelephone number to an individual reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence\nCommunity to be associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\nInformation contained in various NSA-maintained knowledge databases containing\nforeign intelligence information acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic\nsurveillance, physical search, or the use of a pen register and trap or trace device, or\nother information, reveals that the telephone number has been previously used by an\nindividual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory; or\n\n\n(TS//SI//NF) The NSA knowledge databases that would be used to satisfy this factor contain fused intelligence\ninformation concerning international terrorism cullcd from signals intelligence, human intelligence, law enforcement\ninformation, and other sourccs. The information compiled in these databases is information that assists the signals\nintelligence system in effecting collection on intelligence targets. For example, a report produced by the CIA may\ninclude the fact that a known terrorist is using a telephone with a particular number. NSA would include that\ninformation in its knowledge databases.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COM1NT//N OFO RN//203 20108\n•\n\nInformation made available to NSA analysts as a result of processing telephony\nmetadata records acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic surveillance,\nphysical search, or the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, or other\ninformation, reveals that the telephone number is used by an individual associated\nwith a foreign power or foreign territory.\n\nWith respect to Internet communications:\nInformation indicates that the electronic communications account/address/identifier\nhas been used to communicate directly with an electronic communications\naccount/address/identifier reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence Community to\nbe used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\nInformation indicates that a user of the electronic communications account/address/\nidentifier has communicated directly with an individual reasonably believed to be\nassociated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\nInformation indicates that the electronic communications account/address/identifier is\nincluded in the \"buddy list\" or address book of an electronic communications\naccount/address/identifier reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence Community to\nbe used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\nInformation indicates that the electronic communications account/address/identifier\nhas been transmitted during a telephone call or other communication with an\nindividual reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence Community to be associated\nwith a foreign power or foreign territory;\n°\n\nPublic Internet postings match the electronic communications account/address/\nidentifier to an individual reasonably believed by the U.S. Intelligence Community to\nbe associated with a foreign power or foreign territory;\nInformation contained in various NSA-maintained knowledge databases of foreign\nintelligence information acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic\nsurveillance, physical search, the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, or\nother information, reveals that electronic communications account/address/identifier\nhas been previously used by an individual associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory;\n\n»\n\nInformation made available to NSA analysts as a result of processing metadata\nrecords acquired by any lawful means, such as electronic surveillance, physical\nsearch, or the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, or other information,\nreveals that the electronic communications account/address/identifier is used by an\nindividual associated with a foreign power or foreign territory; or\nInformation indicates that Internet Protocol ranges and/or specific electronic\nidentifiers or signatures (e.g., specific types of cryptology or steganography) are used\nalmost exclusively by individuals associated with a foreign power or foreign territory,\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFGRN//20320108\nor are extensively used by individuals associated with a foreign power or foreign\nterritory.\nII. (S) POST-TARGETING ANALYSIS BY NSA\n(S//SI) After a person has been targeted for acquisition by NSA, NSA will conduct posttargeting analysis. Such analysis is designed to detect those occasions when a person who when\ntargeted was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States has since entered the\nUnited States, and will enable NSA to take steps to prevent the intentional acquisition of any\ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of\nacquisition to be located in the United States, or the intentional targeting of a person who is\ninside the United States. Such analysis may include:\nFor telephone numbers:\nc\n\nRoutinely comparing telephone numbers tasked pursuant to these procedures against\ninformation that has been incidentally collected from the Global System for Mobiles\n(GSM) Home Location Registers (HLR). These registers receive updates whenever a\nGSM phone moves into a new sendee area. Analysis of this HLR information provides a\nprimary indicator of a foreign user of a mobile telephone entering the United States.\n\n•\n\nNSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target has entered or\nintends to enter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to\nanalytic and intelligence requirements and priorities.\n\nFor electronic communications accounts/addresses/identifiers:\n® Routinely checking all electronic communications accounts/addresses/identifiers tasked\npursuant to these procedures against available databases that contain Internet\ncommunications data (including metadata) to determine if an electronic communications\naccount/address/identifier was accessed from overseas. Such databases contain\ncommunications contact information and summaries of communications activity from\nNSA signals intelligence collection. The foreign access determination is made based on\ncomparing the Internet Protocol address associated with the account activity to other\ninformation NSA possesses about geographical area(s) serviced by particular Internet\nProtocol addresses. If the IP address associated with the target activity is identified as a\nU.S.-based network gateway (e.g., a Hotmail server) or a private Internet Protocol\naddress, then NSA analysts will be required to perform additional research to determine if\nthe access was in a foreign country using additional criteria such as machine identifier or\ncase notation (NSA circuit identifier) of a communications link known to be foreign.\nSuch databases normally maintain information about such activity for a 12-month period.\nThis data will be used in an attempt to rule out false positives from U.S.-based network\ngateways. If the account access is determined to be from a U.S.-based machine, further\nanalytic checks will be performed using content collection to determine if the target has\nmoved into the United States.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n•\n\nRoutinely comparing electronic communications accounts/addresses/identifiers tasked\npursuant to these procedures against a list of electronic communications accounts/\naddresses/identifiers already identified by NSA as being accessed from inside the United\nStates. This will help ensure that no target has been recognized to be located in the\nUnited States.\n\no\n\nNSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a target has entered or intends to\nenter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic\nand intelligence requirements and priorities.\n\n(S) If NSA determines that a target has entered the United States, it will follow the procedures\nset forth in section IV of this document, including the termination of the acquisition from the\ntarget without delay. In cases where NSA cannot resolve an apparent conflict between\ninformation indicating that the target has entered the United States and information indicating\nthat the target remains located outside the United States, NSA will presume that the target has\nentered the United States and will terminate the acquisition from that target. If at a later time\nNSA determines that the target is in fact located outside the United States, NSA may re-initiate\nthe acquisition in accordance with these procedures.\n(S) If NSA determines that a target who at the time of targeting was believed to be a non-United\nStates person was in fact a United States person, it will follow the procedures set forth in section\nIV of this document, including the termination of the acquisition from the target without delay.\nIII. (U) DOCUMENTATION\n(S) Analysts who request tasking will document in the tasking database a citation or citations to\nthe information that led them to reasonably believe that a targeted person is located outside the\nUnited States. Before tasking is approved, the database entry for that tasldng will be reviewed in\norder to verify that the database entry contains the necessary citations.\n(S) A citation is a reference that identifies the source of the information, such as a report number\nor communications intercept identifier, which NSA will maintain. The citation will enable those\nresponsible for conducting oversight to locate and review the information that led NSA analysts\nto conclude that a target is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\n(S) Analysts also will identify the foreign power or foreign territory about which they expect to\nobtain foreign intelligence information pursuant to the proposed targeting.\nIV. (U) OVERSIGHT AND COMPLIANCE\n(S) NSA's Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) Oversight and Compliance, with NSA's Office\nof General Counsel (OGC), will develop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures\nto ensure intelligence personnel responsible for approving the targeting of persons under these\nprocedures, as well as analysts with access to the acquired foreign intelligence information\nunderstand their responsibilities and the procedures that apply to this acquisition. SID Oversight\nand Compliance lias established processes for ensuring that raw traffic is labeled and stored only\nin authorized repositories, and is accessible only to those who have had the proper training. SID\nTOP SECHET//COMINT//NOFGRN//203201O8\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFGRN//20320108\nOversight and Compliance will conduct ongoing oversight activities and will make any\nnecessary reports, including those relating to incidents of noncompliance, to the NSA Inspector\nGeneral and OGC, in accordance with its NSA charter. SID Oversight and Compliance will also\nensure that necessary corrective actions are taken to address any identified deficiencies. To that\nend, SID Oversight and Compliance will conduct periodic spot checks of targeting decisions and\nintelligence disseminations to ensure compliance with established procedures, and conduct\nperiodic spot checks of queries in data repositories.\n(S) The Department of Justice (DO J) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n(ODNI) will conduct oversight of NSA's exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act,\nwhich will include periodic reviews by DOJ and ODNI personnel to evaluate the implementation\nof the procedures. Such reviews will occur at least once every sixty days.\n(S) NSA will report to DOJ, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil\nLiberties Protection Officer any incidents of noncompliance with these procedures by NSA\npersonnel that result in the intentional targeting of a person reasonably believed to be located in\nthe United States, the intentional targeting of a United States person, or the intentional\nacquisition of any communication in which the sender and all intended recipients are known at\nthe time of acquisition to be located within the United States. NSA will provide such reports\nwithin five business days of learning of the incident. Any information acquired by intentionally\ntargeting a United States person or a person not reasonably believed to be outside the United\nStates at the time of such targeting will be purged from NSA databases.\n(S) NSA will report to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National\nSecurity Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and oversight, to the ODNI\nOffice of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection Officer, any incidents of\nnoncompliance (including overcollection) by any electronic communication service provider to\nwhom the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence issued a directive under\nsection 702. Such report will be made within five business days after determining that the\nelectronic communication service provider has not complied or does not intend to comply with a\ndirective.\n(S) In the event that NSA concludes that a person is reasonably believed to be located outside the\nUnited States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside the United States, or\nif NSA concludes that a person who at the time of targeting was believed to be a non-United\nStates person was in fact a United States person, it will take the following steps:\n1) Terminate the acquisition without delay and determine whether to seek a Court order\nunder another section of the Act. If NSA inadvertently acquires a communication\nsent to or from the target while the target is or was located inside the United States,\nincluding any communication where the sender and all intended recipients are\nreasonably believed to be located inside the United States at the time of acquisition,\nsuch communication will be treated in accordance with the applicable minimization\nprocedures.\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\fTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFGRN//20320108\n2) Report the incident to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the\nNational Security Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and\noversight, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties\nProtection Officer within five business days.\nV. (U) DEPARTURE FROM PROCEDURES\n(S) If, in order to protect against an immediate threat to the national security, NSA determines\nthat it must take action, on a temporary basis, in apparent departure from these procedures and\nthat it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures from the Attorney\nGeneral and Director of National Intelligence, NSA may take such action and will report that\nactivity promptly to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National Security\nDivision with responsibility for intelligence operations and oversight, to the ODNI Office of\nGeneral Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection Officer. Under such circumstances,\nthe Government will continue to adhere to all of the statutory limitations set forth in subsection\n702(b) of the Act.\n\nDate\nAttorney General of the United ^tates\n\nTOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20320108\n\n\f",

What data is missing?\n\n6)\n\nWhy are you showing metadata record counts versus content?\n\n7)\n\nDo you distinguish between sustained collect and survey collect?\n\n8)\n\nWhat is the technical architecture for the tool?\n\n9)\n\nWhat are some upcoming features/enhancements?\n\n1 0 ) How are new features or views requested and prioritized?\n1 1 ) Why are record counts different from other tools like A S D F and What's On Cover?\n1 2 ) Why is the tool N O F O R N ? Is there a releasable version?\n1 3 ) How do you compile your record counts for each country?\n\nNote: This document is a work-in-progress and will be updated frequently as additional\nquestions and guidance are provided.\n1) (U) What is BOUNDLESSINFORMANT?\n\nWhat is its purpose?\n\n(U//FOUO) B O U N D L E S S I N F O R M A N T is a G A O prototype tool for a self-documenting SIGINT\nsystem. The purpose of the tool is to fundamentally shift the manner in which G A O describes its\ncollection posture. BOUNDLESSINFORMANT\nprovides the ability to dynamically describe GAO's\ncollection capabilities (through metadata record counts) with no human intervention and graphically\ndisplay the information in a map view, bar chart, or simple table. Prior to\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT,\nthe method for understanding the collection capabilities of GAO's\nassets involved ad hoc surveying of repositories, sites, developers, and/or programs and offices. By\nextracting information from every DNI and D N R metadata record, the tool is able to create a near realtime snapshot of GAO's collection capability at any given moment. The tool allows users to select a\ncountry on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collection against that\ncountry. The tool also allows users to view high level metrics by organization and then drill down to a\nmore actionable level - down to the program and cover term.\nSample Use Cases\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) How many records are collected for an organizational unit (e.g. FORNSAT)?\n\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) How many records (and what type) are collected against a particular country?\n\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) Are there any visible trends for the collection?\n\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) What assets collect against a specific country? What type of collection?\n\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) What is the field of view for a specific site? What countriees does it collect\nagainst? What type of collection?\n\n2) (U) Who are the intended users of the tool?\n•\n(U//FOUO) Mission and collection managers seeking to understand output characteristics\nof a site based on what is being ingested into downstream repositories.\n•\n—(U//FOUO)-Strategic Managers seeking to understand top level metrics at the\norganization/office level or seeking to answer data calls on N S A collection capability.\n\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - FAQ\nUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\nPage 1 o\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nBOUNDLESSINFORMANT - Frequently Asked Questions\n09-06-2012\n•\n(U//FOUO) Analysts looking for additional sites to task for coverage of a particular\ntechnology within a specific country.\n\n3) What are the different views?\n(U//FOUO) Map View - The Map View is designed to allow users to view overall DNI, DNR, or\naggregated collection posture of the agency or a site. Clicking on a country will show the collection\nposture (record counts, type of collection, and contributing SIGADs or sites) against that particular\ncountry in addition to providing a graphical display of record count trends. In order to bin the records\ninto a country, a normalized phone number (DNR) or an administrative region atom (DNI) must be\npopulated within the record. Clicking on a site (within the Site Specific view) will show the viewshed\nfor that site - what countries the site collects against.\n(U//FOUO) Org View - The Organization View is designed to allow users to view the metadata record\ncounts by organizational structure (i.e. G A O - SSO - RAM-A - SPINNERET) all the way down to the\ncover term. Since it's not necessary to have a normalized number or administrative region populated,\nthe numbers in the Org View will be higher than the numbers in the Map View.\n(U//FOUO) Similarity View - The Similarity View is currently a placeholder view for an upcoming\nfeature that will graphically display sites that are similar in nature. This can be used to identify areas\nfor a de-duplication effort or to inform analysts of additional SIGADs to task for queries (similar to\nA m a z o n ' s \"if you like this item, you'll also like these\" feature).\n\n4)\n\n(U) Where do you get your data?\n(U//FOUO) B O U N D L E S S I N F O R M A N T extracts metadata records from G M - P L A C E postF A L L O U T (DNI ingest processor) and post-TUSKATTIRE (DNR ingest processor). The records are\nenriched with organization information (e.g. SSO, F O R N S A T ) and cover term. Every valid DNI and\nD N R metadata record is aggregated to provide a count at the appropriate level. See the different views\nquestion above for additional information.\n\n5) (U) Do you have all the data? What data is missing?\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) The tool resides on G M - P L A C E which is only accredited up to TS//SI//NOFORN.\nTherefore, the tool does not contain ECI or FISA data.\n\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) The Map View only shows counts for records with a valid normalized number\n(DNR) or administrative region atom (DNI).\n\n•\n\n(U//FOUO) Only metadata records that are sent back to N S A - W through FASCIA or\nF A L L O U T are counted.

    "doc_text": "NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY\nFORT GEORGE G. MEADE, MARYLAND\n\n20755 6000\n-\n\n10 March 2014\nMr. James R. Silkenat\nPresident, American Bar Association\n321 North Clark Street\nChicago, IL 60654-7598\nDear Mr. Silkenat:\nThank you very much for your letter of February 20, 2014, regarding the importance of\npreserving and respecting the attorney-client privilege. We greatly appreciate the work of the\nAmerican Bar Association (ABA) and the organization's mission of \"defending liberty and\ndelivering justice.\" At a time when certain aspects of the reporting and commentary about the\nNational Security Agency (NSA) shed more heat than light on important matters of security,\nliberty, and privacy worthy of meaningful public discussion, we also appreciate the thoughtful\nand constructive approach of your inquiry.\nNSA is firmly committed to the rule of law and the bedrock legal principle of attorneyclient privilege, which as you noted, is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential\ncommunications. We absolutely agree that the attorney-client privilege deserves the strong\nprotections afforded by our legal system, and that it is vital that proper policies and practices are\nin place to prevent its erosion. Although it is not possible to address press reports about any\nspecific alleged intelligence activities—and thus to point out the absence of critical factual\ninformation in any such reports—we appreciate the opportunity to clarify our current policies\nand practices and to work with the ABA to ensure that the public has confidence that our\nintelligence institutions respect the role of privileged communications.\nLet me be absolutely clear: NSA has afforded, and will continue to afford, appropriate\nprotection to privileged attorney-client communications acquired during its lawful foreign\nintelligence mission in accordance with privacy procedures required by Congress, approved by\nthe Attorney General, and, as appropriate, reviewed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt. Moreover, NSA cannot and does not ask its foreign partners to conduct any intelligence\nactivity that it would be prohibited from conducting itself in accordance with U.S. law. This\nbroad principle applies to all of our signals intelligence activities, including any activities that\ncould implicate potentially privileged communications.\nNSA conducts signals intelligence activities in accordance with Executive Order (E0)\n12333 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), as appropriate. As you are aware,\nunder FISA the Agency may not target any unconsenting U.S. person anywhere in the world\nunder circumstances in which the U.S. person would enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy\nwithout an individualized determination of probable cause by a federal judge (absent certain\nlimited exceptions, such as an emergency) that the target is a foreign power or an agent of a\nforeign power. The term \"U.S. person\" could include an individual, company, or other\norganization such as a U.S. law firm. Moreover, FISA states that lily) otherwise privileged\n\n\fcommunication obtained in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this Act shall\nlose its privileged character.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1806(a). Finally, FISA also provides that \"[n]o\ninformation acquired from electronic surveillance pursuant to this title may be used or disclosed\nby Federal officers or employees except for lawful purposes.\" Id.\nWe appreciate that \"[t]he ABA understands the critical role that NSA plays in gathering\nintelligence information and protecting our national security.\" As the ABA acknowledges,\n\"during the course of these activities, it is inevitable that certain communications between U.S.\nlaw firms and their clients may be collected or otherwise obtained by the agency.\" Given the\ninevitability of incidental collection of U.S. person information during the course of NSA's\nlawful foreign intelligence mission—to include potentially privileged information—the issue is\nhow to provide appropriate protections for any such information when it may be acquired.\nAccordingly, EO 12333 and FISA require compliance with procedures designed to protect the\nprivacy of U.S. persons, which would include U.S. law firms. These privacy procedures must be\napproved by the Attorney General and, when appropriate, by the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court.\nThese procedures, many of which have been recently declassified and are available at\nicontherecord.tumblr.com, are designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, and dissemination\nof information to, from, or about U.S. persons, including any potentially privileged information,\nconsistent with NSA's foreign intelligence mission. For example, these procedures require NSA\npersonnel to destroy any non-pertinent information of or concerning any U.S. person that NSA\nmay incidentally acquire during signals intelligence operations.' This destruction requirement\napplies to privileged as well as non-privileged communications. Moreover, as a general matter,\nthese procedures provide that the dissemination of information about U.S. persons—privileged\nor not—is expressly prohibited unless it is necessary to understand foreign intelligence or assess\nits importance; is evidence of a crime; or indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm. 2\nRecognizing that special considerations apply to potentially privileged communications,\nNSA's approved procedures also contain provisions that expressly address privileged material\nand require consultation with the Office of General Counsel when such situations arise. For\nexample, NSA's procedures state:\nAll proposed disseminations of information constituting U.S. person privileged\ncommunications (e.g. attorney/client, doctor/patient) and all information\nconcerning criminal activities or criminal or judicial proceedings in the United\nStates must be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel prior to dissemination.\nI See generally, U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive No. 18 (USSID SP00018) dated January 25, 2011 (implementing\nthe procedures approved by the Attorney General contained in Department of Defense Regulation 5240.1-R and its\nclassified annex). See also Section 3(b)(1) of Minimization Procedures Used by the National Security Agency in\n\nConnection with Acquisitions of Foreign Intelligence Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act of 1978, as amended, dated October 3, 2011 (hereinafter NSA's Section 702 Minimization\nProcedures).\n2 50 U.S.C. § 1801(h)(2) & (h)(3); see also USSID SP00018, Section 7.2; NSA's Section 702 Minimization\nProcedures, Section 6(b).\n\n\fUSSID SP00018, Section 7.4.3\nThe purpose of this requirement is to ensure that, in the event NSA personnel discover a\npotentially privileged communication during their review of signals intelligence information, the\nOffice of General Counsel must be consulted on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the\ninformation is in fact privileged and, if so, the appropriate steps to be taken.\nAlthough it is not possible to discuss the specific advice provided with respect to any\nparticular classified intelligence operation, NSA's Office of General Counsel has, in the past,\nprovided clear guidance on the appropriate steps to protect privileged information. Such steps\ncould include—among other advice tailored to the particular facts and circumstances under\nwhich sensitive intelligence activities have been or are to be undertaken—requesting that certain\ncollection or reporting be limited; that intelligence reports be written so as to prevent or limit the\ninclusion of privileged material and to exclude U.S. identities; and that dissemination of such\nreports be limited and subject to appropriate warnings or restrictions on use.\nFinally, it is important to note that NSA's approved procedures expressly recognize that\nthe acquisition of privileged communications raises particularly sensitive concerns in the context\nof criminal proceedings. For example, NSA's procedures for certain FISA information state:\nAs soon as it becomes apparent that a communication is between a person who is\nknown to be under a criminal indictment in the United States and an attorney who\nrepresents that individual in the matter under indictment (or someone acting on\nbehalf of the attorney), monitoring of that communication will cease and the\ncommunication will be identified as an attorney-client communication in a log\nmaintained for that purpose. The relevant portion of the communication\ncontaining that conversation will be segregated and the National Security Division\nof the Department of Justice will be notified so that appropriate procedures may\nbe established to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal\nprosecution, while preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein.\nSection 4 of NSA's Section 702 Minimization Procedures.\nIn sum, NSA recognizes the importance of attorney-client privileged communications\nconsistent with our legal traditions and the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nAct; has privacy procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court to address any incidentally acquired U.S. person information and issues of\nattorney-client privilege when they arise; has taken a variety of appropriate steps to protect\npotentially privileged information in any circumstance in which it may be encountered; and\nworks closely with the Department of Justice to ensure that privileged communications are\nhandled properly in the context of criminal proceedings.\n\n\nSee also, Section 4 of NSA's Section 702 Minimisation Procedures.\n\n\fIf you have additional questions or concerns, I would encourage continued dialogue with\nour General Counsel, Raj De, at 301-688-6705.\n\nKEI B. ALE NDER\nGeneral, U.S. Army\nDirector, NSA\n\n\f",

SSO expects\nto receive buddy lists, credit card info, call data records, user account\ninfo, and other material. On 29 March 2013, SSO forwarded approximately 2000\nSkype selectors for stored communications to be adjudicated in 5V41 and the\nElectronic Communications Surveillance Unit (ECSU) at FBI. 5V41 had been\nworking on adjudication for the highest priority selectors ahead of time and\nhad about 100 ready for ECSU to evaluate. It could take several weeks for\n51141 to work through all 2000 selectors to get them approved, and ECSU will\nlikely take longer to grant the approvals. As of 2 April, ESCU had approved\nover 30 selectors to be sent to Skype for collection. PRISM Skype collection\nhas carved out a vital niche in NSA reporting in less than two years with\nterrorism, Syrian opposition and regime, and exec/special series reports\nbeing the top topics.

Until now, PRISM\nwould not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other\nthan the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action\nwill mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any\ne—mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow\nanalysts to task these non—Microsoft e—mail addresses to PRISM, however,\nSSO intends to fix that this summer. In the meantime, NSA, FBI and Dept of\nJustice coordinated over the last six months to gain approval for PRINTAURA\nto send all current and future Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype. This\nresulted in about 9800 selectors being sent to Skype and successful\ncollection has been received which otherwise would have been missed.\n\n\f",

M5, working with the FBI, developed a surveillance\ncapability to deal with the new SSL. These solutions were successfully\n\ntested and went live 12 Dec 2012. The SSL solution was applied to all\ncurrent FISA and 702/PRISM requirements - no changes to UTT tasking\nprocedures were required. The SSL solution does not collect server-based\nvoice/video or file transfers. The MS legacy collection system will remain\nin place to collect voice/video and file transfers. As a result there wilt\nbe some duplicate collection of text-based chat from the new and legacy\nsystems which will be addressed at a later date. An increase in collection\nvolume as a result of this solution has already been noted by CES.\n\n\f",

With the requirement that this be done\nrapidly and within our legal authorities, the BLARNEY team\njumped in to work with organizations and partners both\ninternal and external to NSA.\n(TS//SIHNF) As DGC, SV and the TOPIs aggressively worked\nthrough the legal paperwork to expedite four new NSA FISA\ncourt orders for Gabon, Uganda, Nigeria and Bosnia, BLARNEY\nOperations Division personnel were behind the scenes\ngathering data determining what survey information was\n\navailable or could be obtained via their long standing FBI\ncontacts. As they worked to obtain information on both the\nUN Missions in NY and the Embassies in DC, the target\n\ndevelopment team greased the skids with appropriate data\nflow personnel and all preparations were made to ensure\ndata could flow to the TOPIs as soon as possible. Several\npersonnel, one from legal team and one from target\ndevelopment team were called in on Saturday 22 May to\nsupport the 24 hour drill legal paperwork exercise doing\ntheir part to ensure the orders were ready for the NSA\nDirector's signature early Monday morning 24 May.\n(5//SI) With OGC and 5V pushing hard to expedite these four\norders, they went from the NSA Director for signature to\nDoD for SECDEF signature and then to DOJ for signature by\nthe FISC judge in record time. All four orders were signed\nby the judge on Wednesday 26 May! Once the orders were\n\nreceived by the BLARNEY legal team, they sprung into action\nparsing these four orders plus another \"normal\" renewal in\none day. Parsing five court orders in one day — a BLARNEY\nrecord!

In fact, sometimes it is very\nhands-on (literally!). Here's how it works: shipments of computer network\ndevices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are\nintercepted. Next, they are redirected to a secret location where Tailored Access\nOperations/Access Operations (AO — S326) employees, with the support of the Remote\nOperations Center (S321), enable the installation of beacon implants directly into our\ntargets' electronic devices. These devices are then re-packaged and placed back into\ntransit to the original destination_ All of this happens with the support of Intelligence\nCommunity partners and the technical wizards in TAO.\n\n\fPage 149\n\n(TS//SI/iNF) Such operations involving supply-chain interdiction are some of the most\nproductive operations in TAO, because they pre-position access points into hard target\nnetworks around the world.\n\n(TS//SIIINF) Left: Intercepted packages are opened carefully; Right: A \"load station\"\nimplants a beacon\n\n\fPage 149\n(TSIISIIINF) In one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supplychain interdiction called back to the NSA covert infrastructure.

While the existing bug doesn't appear to\naffect traffic, applying the new software update could. Unfortunately, there is\nnow way to be sure. We can't simulate the bug in our lab and so ifs\nimpossible to predict exactly what will happen when we apply the software\nupdate. We propose to update one of the nodes in NBP-320 first to determine\nif the update goes smoothly.\nRecently we tried to reset the standby manager card in the HOMEMAKER\nnode. When that failed, we attempted to physically reseat it Since it was the\nstandby card, we did not expect that would cause any problems. However,\nupon reseating the card, the entire OHS crashed and we lost all traffic through\nthe box. It took more than an hour to recover from this failure.\nThe worst case scenario is that we have to blow away the entire configuration\nand start from scratch. Prior to starting our upgrade, we will save the\nconfiguration so that if we have to configure the box from scratch, we can\nsimply uploade the saved configuration. We estimate that we will be down for\nno more than an hour for each node in the system.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nLast CCB Entry:\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nPrograms Affected:\n\nI\n\nNAME REDACTED\n3/26/2013 8:1613 AM\nWe have tested the upgrade in our lab and it works well.
