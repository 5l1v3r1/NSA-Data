What to Remember

Conclusion

•	PRISM is one of the most valuable, unique, and productive accesses for NSA- don’t
miss out on your targets.

Recommend tasking fill DNI and DNR selectors to FAA 702 if they meet the
criteria. Your target’s communications could be flowing through SSO’s accesses
which only FAA can access. Communications paths constantly change.

•	Recommend using Rules-Based-Tasking in UTT to ensure that both PRISM and
passive/upstream SSO FAA accesses are given the selectors.

•	Some Product Lines do not use PRISM and other SSO accesses optimally. They are
missing unique collection on their targets.

•	FAA 702 collection = PRISM program providers + FAA Upstream SSO programs
with access to thousands of non-PRISM internet domains, DNR collection, cyber
signatures and I.P. addresses.
